I just put mine together and it warns that you mustn't keep the gas connected and that each time you reattach the gas you have to do a soap test.  I guess I can keep screwing the propane tank on and off, but that's such a pain and the soapy water is messy!

First roast turned out well, but in Winter, California, 60 degree weather it took a little longer than expected (2.5 lbs beef and it was edible/medium 160 degrees internal in about 3.5 hours and two rather large handfuls of apple chips soaked for 24 hrs).  The flame blew out three times and scared me because I wasn't watching it the whole time, and when I thought of propane exploding upwards!  I didn't think it would go out so easily, so I just ended up feeding it more gas and tried to cut the intensity of the heat using the air intake adjustment.  

You have to add more chips to get a lot of smoke flavor so that is easy, but you have to lift the whole body up and off including the water pot and meat, which could get heavy, but at least you can keep the lid on and keep some of the heat in there.  A good thing about this design is that if you are doing charcoal, you can replace the charcoal quickly.

Overall, I'm very excited, but I had those couple gripes...no door to access the water pan and no way to access the coals without lifting the whole top off and no easy way to remove the propane for safety.  I love the ease of having a gas option as you have to have the patience of a saint to tend to my other charcoal smoker as it didn't have a way to get rid of the ash to keep the temperature even and accessing the coal bowl was really a pain, especially if you wanted to add HOT glowing charcoal.  

I'm pleased though!  I got this one for my birthday as a gift to myself since I always wanted a gas grill for instant gratification.  I do love charcoal briquettes and chunks as well, so I'm pleased I still have that option.  Read the owners manual thouroughly before purchasing so that you don't have any surprises.  You also need adjustable wrenches or specific sizes (I used two crescent adjustable wrenches) to put it together, but it went together fairly intuitively and quickly

We had to move it about our place in a few different windows before we found one that actually got the radio waves (and we know our directionals here).  So, if you get it, just be patient and leave it overnight in a few different places before you give up

Bought this to use with my Weber Smokey Mountain.  I almost bought a Sunbeam rib rack for half the price at the local home improvement chain but it seemed a lot flimsier.  This rack is solid and built with Weber quality.

The one reason I can't give it 5 stars is because the Sunbeam rack has skewers for potatoes and I would really like to see that on this rack.  

If the ribs are too big, I just wrap them around the wrap quite easily

I bought this clock for my pool deck and it works great - it set itself within 10 minutes of putting the battery in.  I have it on a wall that has an overhang that is about 4 feet, so it is protected from the weather.  You can see it well from across the yard.  Have had several comments from visitors - they think its a great outdoor clock.  The thermometer is not automatically set, you need to set it.  It seems to work fine, I have checked it a couple of times with the local temperature on the radio/tv.  Would recommend the clock to those looking for an outdoor time piece

While we've used Coleman folding stoves for years, if you have trunk space, there is no reason on earth to limit yourself to a small stove when you can grill with this wonderful tabletop grill. The small tank makes this practical for camping. If you want real barbecue while tenting under the stars, and you camp where a tailgate or a picnic table is available, this is a great choice for camping equipment. We still like the Coleman for boiling water, but I love barbecuing on a propane grill like this

This is a nice rotisserie.  It could use another basket to keep the meat from getting away from it as it cooks (and shrinks in the process).  You will need pliers to tighten and loosen the baskets

I bought this clock last week. 
Amazon was prompt in shipping it on time.
On having received it I place the AA battery in the clock selected the time zone place it on the wall after some time the clock second hand and hour hand started moving fast. It is actually searching for the signal. If it gets it immediately the time will be set accurately in 5 minutes. 
If not every hour the clock searches for the accurate time relayed from the colorado server. The clock finds the time signal within the next 4-5 hours. The chances of the clock finding the signal is high over night when there is less distortion. 

Once ir receives the accurate time it will never fall behind. 

A very good time piece

I had to return my 1st order due to mould on the wood (around the joins) and inside the glass front. My replacement has a little mould inside the glass front, but I decided I could live with it.. I blame Amazon's storage for this rather than the manufacturing of it by LaCrosse.

The glass front is spherical, so tends to get weird light reflections, so watch for this when you are hanging it.

Note that when the battery is low, the second hand will move in 2 second jumps to let you know that the battery is low - this is a feature, not a problem, which I like.

Other than that it works great! (I live close to Boulder and NIST, where the radio signal comes from, so also take this into account when ordering any radio controlled clocks).

This clock set itself within a few minutes and has worked well for the few months that we've had it. I loved not having to climb up and get it down to re-set it for daylight savings time!

Just so you know, this clock is not silver in color (I thought it was from the picture). It's more of a pearlized off-white

The umbrella was quite a score through amazon - including the shipping & handling.  It was still cheaper than Walmart!  lol......additionally, it is of great quality.  We utilize this umbrella for our bistro table and our porch now is all green.  It is sturdy and even withstood being blow over with Tropical Storm Tammy!  Twice

While the principle of the product is rather simple (a flat piece of metal with spikes sticking up), it is very useful. The instructions are very easy -   coat with a light coating of oil, and drop the potatoes on the metal spikes.  Stick on BBQ and cook. Allegedly cooks faster than potatoes would in an oven.

Here are my reflections after my first time using this contraption:

1) I started cooking potatoes at the same time as the steak and vegetables. By the time my steak and asparagus were cooked, the potatoes needed another 10 minutes or so. In hindsight, I should have started the potatoes while the grill was heating up; and they would have been done on time

2) I varied from the original instructions - wrapping two of the four potatoes in aluminum foil before placing them on the spikes. They cooked faster, though had less of a roasted taste (that I found very desirable!)

3) On one of the four spikes I placed a sweet potato - which tasted fantastic after coming off the grill! It needed no foil, and cooked a little faster than the exposed (foil-free) potatoes.

In summary, you should probably start cooking the potatoes while the grill is heating up. You can wrap them in foil to make the job faster; though it will cut back on the nice roasted flavor that you otherwise get.

I gave it 4 stars because it isn't 100% non-stick, even with a coat of oil. When I pull potatoes off the rack, they tend to stick to the spike and tear that part of the potato open. Still taste great, though

Works great with my LaCrosse weather station.  Make sure you check for compatible models.  I have two external temperature sensors now (one for outside and one for my shed).  The only issue is that you must remove the batteries from all units, install them back in the external temp sensors and then into the main weather station for it to find both of them correctly.  This is in the directions of course.  Hope this helps

I don?t usually write things like this but having a Mosquitoes Magnet I wanted more protection without the annoyance of refilling and carrying propane around and not to mention the cost. Every three weeks having to buy propane is bad enough! I took a chance on this Galaxie product and I am glad I did its capturing everything in the yard. It appears to works almost as well as the Magnet and theirs no refilling propane!  If this keeps up I will buy two more of these units and retire the Magnet.  I give this product five stars!

Good quality and durability for any price!  Our back yard is in the direct sun all-day.  This umbrella is perfect for our yard because of the 11' canopy, and durability.  It gets quite windy in the afternoon, and the umbrella has held up well to rain, wind, & sun.  The only problem I had was the width of the pole.  It is too large to fit in out standard pool side tables.  I had to buy a heavy stand that would fit the 2" pole.  Problem solved!  Now I have a GREAT umbrella and a very heavy stand that seems to be the perfect accessory to our back yard, at a reasonable price.  Oh, and they delivered it before I thought they would.

Purchased the sofa and two chairs for my backyard and I have to say, they look great.  Clean lines, good proportions, beautiful chocolatey color.  The seat cushion is a bit firm, but that is probably good to help it hold up.  I have to say the linen cover is a bit disappointing as the fabric is a bit more like sailcloth then I'd hoped... but that is easily recovered, and I can certainly deal with it in the meantime, especially given the great price.  The only other thing is that the seat is quite deep and I feel like could have used some sort of back cushion, but we bought some outdoor throw pillows and that did the trick.  Let's hope these pieces hold up, as if they do, I'd say they are a great design value

Stylewise, it is a bit of an awkward fit in our traditional-decor house, so my wife had me locate it in my basement office.

Even from my northwest-facing daylight basement on the west side slope of the West hills in Portland, OR, this has no problem syncing itself to the atomic time radio signal  (which originates in Colorado) at night.  I love having an always accurate clock!

The thermometers seem accurate, the remote sensor has held up well so far, and I have not had to replace any batteries yet after three months of use.

Got this for $29 and free shipping. First one had a bad display. Second one came from Amazon in 2 days and worked fine. Takes a while for it to sync up. Outdoor temp was screwy but then settled in to something reasonable. Don't know about the accuracy as some other people have suggested, but seems in the ballpark to be correct. Very good looking piece - for $30 it is money well spent

There are two ways to measure the quality of an insect zapper. First, how powerful is it light? That will determine from how far away insects will be attracted. Second, how powerful are its "shocks"? That will, of course, determine what happens to the hapless critters. The Flowtron BK-40D performs both of these admirably.

This should be set up AWAY from your seating area - at least 10 yards. It will attract and kill so many insects that if it is near you, you will get covered. Also, the zapping noises it makes as it kills can be intimidating to young kids.

The plug comes off a short (6 inches or so) wire from the top as it hangs down from your pole. Make sure whatever extension cord you use is rated for outdoor use.

There is a compartment just below this model, which will fit a sticky mosquito attractant - one comes free with this package. You can get refills easily at Target or WalMart. Cost about $4. You probably will not need them, however, because the UV light does a good job of attracting insects.

I recommend it fully

I bought this item for my husband, when it arrived in the mail the box looked small, but he opened it and we checked it out. The weekend came and he made beer chicken, and he has since bbq 6 chickens.  He wants me to cook a beer can chicken in the oven, I like the idea but I'm not sure how to cook one in the oven. The grease and all, sounds like a mess..but I'll see what happens.

I've always felt it's probably a little unsanitary to use an aluminum beer can with inked labeling on a hot grill.  Maybe not, but it gives me pause.  This device works as a more stable and possibly more healthy alternative to a can of Bud.  It is also perfect if you want to use other liquids such as wine, juice or whatever.  The only downside is the clean-up.  It consists of four parts, each of which get coated with chicken drippings and need some serious scrubbing to get off the cooked-on residue.  I've found a dishwasher alone doesn't really remove all of it.  A little scrubbing is necessary to really get the device clean.  

This is certainly a useful item for us backyard cooks.  It's a little inconvenient compared to using a beer can that can be tossed in the trash after using

We use it for a small tailgate (we have other grills for larger tailgate parties) party serving three people. It is not big enough to serve more people. After several uses we learned that we had to use more charcoal, and once we made the change and increased the amount of charcoal (almost to the top)the grill was able to cook a second round of food. Packs up very easily, sets up very easily, and puts together very easily. Can cook 2 steaks and a few franks OR 6 hamburgers at one time.

I got this grill for Mother's Day from my boyfriend.  He is really into buying things that last and things that are worth the money. This is one of those items! This grill is great! I just love it, I have grilled 3 times so far and everything has been perfect, it cooks really fast and even I would highly recommend this.  With the chimney we were able to reuse some of the charcoals twice so far which is just cool. So, get the Weber chimney as well! You will be just as pleased as I am with my new grill

I was skeptical after reading some of the reviews of this and looking at the price.  Once i got it and lit it, unbelievable.  I have a tendency to read the reviews and pick up on others issues with products, so there is a little propane hissing, but the heat that it puts out is unbelievable.  The flame levels were alot higher when you think about how much heat and flames your grill puts out.  The handles/footrests are heavy duty and perfectly placed.  Saying all that, i can see the only drawback is the amount of fuel you might go through.  It says that it last 7 hrs, that might be a little generous.  I got rave reviews when i started it up, and the next day when we had a real fire pit going, everyone appreciated that they didn't have to wash their clothes due to the smokey smell.  That has to be the best part.  Aagin, great product

This grill is great.  It heated up fast and cooked up my steaks pretty evenly.  Much much better than grills I've used in the past.

Assembly took about an hour by myself.  I'd recommend having another person to help you.  The assembly instructions are all pictures and no text, so it's a bit difficult to follow at times.  The construction of the grill is very good.  The stainless steel tracks tons of finger prints, but looks beautiful.

The penny shipping was good, too.  I received the grill exactly a week from the day I ordered it.  Eagle called me the day before to schedule a delivery time and on the day of delivery, they called in advance of showing up so I didn't have to wait around at home for them.  The delivery guy wheeled it all the way into my garage for me

The other reviews are correct. This unit works very well in every way, a basket mesh kind of food holder would be a good option, use a drip pan and keep the coals off to the sides, the ring riser/extension is useful for smoking and cooking big things, etc. It is all good, but there is more:

Who do you know who actually has a charcoal grill and a rotisserie? Nobody. If you get one, your guests will be entertained on several levels and you will be the Master. A rotisseries is professional looking, produces unmatched taste and an exciting demonstration-style cooking experience for everyone. Those that utilize them are seen as proficient and competent. Not a bad label for you, eh? Might get you somewhere.

The best meal I ever had was a rotisserie turkey that saved me from starvation after a Hike of Death. Perhaps it can save you or a loved one.

Rotisserie cooking lends itself to the acclaimed high heat, short cooking time technique. Hot coals and the self-basting action work well here. One of the major gourmet magazines cooked turkeys every way known and strongly recommended the high heat way. This is also the suggested method for cooking heritage meats and wild game.

Starting out at 500+ degrees and ending at something short of US government temperature recommendations is the secret. A turkey, for example, is best taken out of the heat at around 170, or less, and allowed to rest. It will go up around 10 degrees after that. 

I tie bacon strips onto the breast and add wet smoking wood chips to the coals. Stuff the cavity with an orange and some garlic. Other things could be used, too. I have rotisseried heritage, free range, organic, kosher and regular good quality supermart turkeys with this high-heat method and they have all been good. 

Governments and institutions have to recommend a heat guaranteed to kill off any and everything, and prevent lawsuits of course. However, fresh good quality meat does not have to be nuked to the point where you could make furniture out of it. Use a separate thermometer, not the supplied pop-out sensor. I am no professional, but I can say it produces the best tasting food.

This cover is very durable and after reading the great reviews on it, I had to get it. I purchased a cheap cover and of course it fell apart and the sun baked it another color. The Weber premium cover looks great and is holding up in the Arizona heat and sun! I am very pleased with it and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone with a Weber grill!!! :)

My story is this:  Got some mice in the house at the start of the winter.  Little poops all over, chewed cereal bars in the closet/cupboard, mice in the trash can etc.  Laid out traps and caught four of them but still had: little poops all over, chewed cereal bars in the closet/cupboard, mice in the trash can etc.  So I brought two of these units.  At first I put them both in the basement where I had actually seen the little critters (I have a pretty big house) and I didn't see any evidence of them in the basement after two days or so but upstairs it was still: little poops all over, chewed cereal bars in the closet/cupboard, mice in the trash can etc.  So I moved the "pest repellers" upstairs and put all my food items in plastic containers.  I saw some evidence of a mouse in the trash the first morning but since then, nothing. I don't know if it was me storing the food better, the pest repellers or both but I have seen nothing.  I have been moving these things around the house every other day or so and they seem to work for me.  I would give the unit five stars but they do have one draw back, they do make noise.  If you expect these things to be quiet your in trouble, they chirp.  It's not too loud and doesn't bother our dog or us but it does make noise.  For me the chirping is a small price to pay to get rid of the mice.

I love my hammock. I actually have 2 now, and they are both in my backyard. I like the white because it goes well with my yard, and sometimes with the multi colored ones you never know what you're going to get. It is also extremely comfortable. If you combine this with the smell of cut grass and a cool breeze and I think you may have just found the key to life

I have been wanting a smoker for a long time and have looked at several.I liked the looks of this unit and could not be happier with the results. I smoked baby back ribs and they were fabulous. I have used it three times and the results were the same fantastic. I talked my grandson into buying one, thats what I think of the smoker.
It assembles easily and is quite attractive on my patio. I just purchased a cover to keep it protected from the sweltering Texas climate.                           R.F.O'Har

Tired of BBQ tongs that cant hold a steak? Cant pickup a slice of eggplant?  Drop hot dogs?  Do away with that stress.  These tongs are able to handle the weight of a large steak as well as manueverable enough to flip thin slices of veggies. The coated handle NEVER gets hot and the overall shape is long enough to reach deep into a grill without scorching your hands.  An instant favorite at our house

Another gadget I had to have.  The best thing about this is the ease of finding the outdoor temperature at night.  It clearly is shown on your ceiling but not distracting when trying to sleep.  You can be just laying there and all you have to do is open your eyes and there is the temperature and if you want you can have it also show the time of day.  The temp and time appear alternately every few seconds.

During daylight hours you cannot see this on the ceiling but you can look at the devise and it will have the same information.  The time is kept in sinc with the atomic time via over the air electronic signals. 

For the price, I reccomend this little toy.

I have found that the outdoor receiving device does need to be located in an area that does not get direct sunlight.  The estimated temperature can be way off when the sun is in a position to affect the receiver, so proper positioning is important

I've been very pleased with this set of BBQ tools.  They are comfortable to use and long enough to keep me away from the flame/heat but not so long they feel unwieldy.  They have a solid feel with comfortable grips (especially for someone with smaller hands - eg, most women), they are easy to wash, and stand up to lots of use (we grill year-round).  I would buy this set again.  It is a big improvement over my last set

I thought I had it made when I got the hammock...the pillow makes it ten times better! The pillow makes it easier to roll over and more comfortable - you can't feel the individual strings in the hammock so much but you  still get the &quot;hammock&quot; feeling. I recommend taking it inside  after every use to make it last longer, but it IS weather proof. A must  have if you have a hammock

I'm sorry but this thing has worked in my room. My breaking point was when I found a massive roach in my bed, well, half of it on my bed and the rest on my upper back... 

I had nasty spiders and mice over-running the place but ever since I installed it, I haven't seen any. I do, however, see them in other rooms, but not one in mine

This lounge/deck chair cushon is worth every peny. It is thick, comfortable (none of those deck chairs are comfortable without a substantial cushion), available in several color choices, and has a soft, not plasticky, cover fabric. You will have to measure the width of your deck chair carefully to see if it will fit. It just barely fit my 'titanic' deck chair because I had to scrunch it up a bit near the arms. But all turned out well and I must say I am very happy with it. It is a quality product and will keep you much more comfortable during your hours on the patio than those cheaper, but much thinner, types sold at outlet stores or supermarkets in summer. Get the best. This is it

I searched a long time for a cushion to fit an old lounge chair which had slightly larger measurements for the new cushions at most stores today.  Horray!!!!!!!!!!  This one is perfect and has served me well for comfort and weather resistance.  It has been an unusually rainy month of May and the cushion justs dries with little or no wiping.  So comfortable too

I haven't had any problems with this clock. It does what it's supposed to, and looks pretty good doing it. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I haven't had it that long ... maybe 3 or 4 weeks. So I'm not sure how it's overall durability will be, but so far so good. Dailight Savings Time is coming up, that will be one of it's first "real" tests. If you're thinking about buying it I say go for it

I thought this was a really good price.  I have yet to season mine, but plan to use it to grill steak indoors when the weather is not so great outside (i.e., 105 degree heat, or chilly winter nights).  I'm still researching seasoning and asking friends for tips on that.

I'm also considering the Emeril cast iron smoker. :)  That costs a bit more though.

A previous reviewer complained about the metallic taste when using this item.  It should be noted that nowhere on the package is the user told that seasoning must be done before it should be used.  I have lots of cast iron utensils and pans so I was well aware of that fact.  I don't use oil as it can give off an unpleasant odor if not completely absorbed into the metal.  I use melted shortening instead.
As far as the grill press itself goes, I couldn't be happier with it.  I used it with Steven Raichlen's Tuscan Grill and it produced very distinctive and flavorful grill marks on steak.  It is great for grilling  butterflied chicken too.  In fact, it is so good with chicken that I might have to have a second one!  If you feel that grilled food should not only taste great but look appetizing too, give this a try.  You'll look like a barbecue guru!

Please remember that unseasoned cast iron needs to be seasoned by the consumer before the first use.  It will rust if not properly seasoned.  To season the Grill Press, remove the handle by unscrewing the two screws on either end.  Rinse with mild soap and water, then thoroughly dry.  Rub cooking oil over the entire surface with a clean rag or a paper towel.  Place it in an oven preheated to 250 degrees fahrenheit for approximately 2 hours.  Handle with care when removing, as the Press will be quite hot.  Use a hot pad.  Let the Grill Press cool on a heat resistant surface, replace the handle, and then store as usual.  Because cast iron is porous, each time you use the Grill Press following the initial seasoning more oil will seep through from foods and enforce the waterproof oil bond.  The Grill Press should not be left in water and is not dishwasher safe.  Rinse the press under hot water after each use and dry immediately by blotting water droplets with a towel.  If directions are properly followed, your Steven Raichlen Cast Iron Grill Press should last for years.

I just received these chairs today.  
They came double boxed and arrived safely.
These are lounge or deep seating chairs, since the description does not specify and they are very comfy.
The frames are in a bronze/brown color, the seating pads are in a tan and off-white and look to be good quality.  My little daughter climbed on the chairs with her muddy shoes as soon as I had them out of the box and I could just dust the dirt off the cushions after letting it dry.
The chairs look to have a solid construction and are not quite as light as some of the cheaper ones you find in the stores.
The chairs are stackable too.
Would buy them again

I received this chair as a Christmas gift last year.  It has been out in the weather most of the time since then and still looks and performs as good as new. It is very easy to unhook and bring in during wind or rain storms. This chair is so comfortable that it has become my daily relaxation ritual. When I first opened its box, I was suprised at the thin cotton twine and I had a hard time imagining it could support me and whichever pet would be on my lap. However it even holds my 240 lb. son with no problem. I suggest that you anchor it to a beam; and if you get one that has problems, exchange it for another one

I can't complain about the durability of these sensors.  I bought the original La Crosse weather station about 5 years ago while located in Texas.  It has recorded temperatures as high as 113 degrees and since I moved to NJ 2.5 years ago, it has also recorded as low as 18 below.  I'd say that's a pretty durable unit so had no qualms about buying a replacement when the original one quit recording humidity and bounced around on the temperature readings within short timeframes.  I'm back and working now that I have this unit...I can't live without my weather station and the La Crosse is nice looking and works

I just recieved this in the mail. Setup was 15 minutes, but the frame and metal is thin.  I am not saying it isn't a good unit, but I am afraid it won't last as long as I had intended.  The burn areas is bigger than most I have seen, but the pan below appears to have some gaps allowing ambers to fall to the grownd.  Again, I have not used this yet - but was expecting it to be a bit tougher in the frame.  I would not pay more than $150 for this - HD, LOWES & Other locations provide for a bit more money what I believe could be longer lasting units.  Overall I am glad I purchased this but learned quality cannont be confirmed via a picture or desciption.  Best of luck and happy burning

The chair set LOOKS great and was pretty much put together. Instructions are OK but could use some more close ups. So here is the trick I found that wasn't mentioned. It is best (the only way I could get things connected at all) to put the "cap" (like a fancy nut with a flange) in the slot first and then feed the bolt into it. That bit of information would have helped a lot. I "do" put lots of things similar to this together so not a complete novice. 

The other - a bit more major problem - was that one leg of the chair appears to have denser wood or the pilot holes were not drilled correctly. So no matter what I did on one side I could not get the final SCREWS (there are only four as other connectors are bolts with end caps) in all the way and came close to permanently stipping the hex bolts. The answer is to drill longer pilot holes but I need someone with a drill to do that so it will be down the line.

I also agree that it is not very comfortable without a thick cushion like the type that goes on lots of outdoor furniture.

So a good product and better than some "put it together yourself" but not perfect. It seems very sturdy but as another reviewer stated it is too soon to tell the longevity of the product

Well, I was looking for a nice Adirondack for a while...getting frustrated with the $249.99 price at most stores.  I decided to take a chance on this chair and I could not be any happier.  This is a quality chair, well built and beautiful right out of the box.  Assembly is easy (compared to any boxed item), but does take some patience (took me an hour for the 1t chair but I'm a moron when it comes to putting things together).  I highly recommend these chairs

I put this on my Amazon Wish List and got it for christmas.  It was easy to set up and does exactly what it is supposed to do w/no glitches or resets.  weather in indiana can be pretty festive so I'm sure this unit will get a big workout.  Only disappointment -- it takes five batteries which are not included; I didn't have that many so I had to wait (oh, bother) to go to the store to set it up.  I would like one that measures wind velocity too, but I haven't found one that does that.  All in all, a very helpful, easy to read and understand unit

I recently purchased this model to replace a separate radio controlled atomic clock and wired In/Out thermometer.

The unit seems well made and the display is easy to read. Based upon my experience so far I would still buy one but the design/implementation could certainly be improved.

1 - The remote distance of 80' is line of sight under perfect conditions. The manual suggests to deduct 20-30 feet for an external wall. If there wasn't an external wall it wouldn't be outdoors now would it?

2 - The time of day is only updated once a day at/near midnight. My unit is off by 2 seconds by noon. Not a big deal but one would expect a bit more accuracy.

3 - The algorithyms for computing the sunrise/sunset and moonrise/moonset seem to be off a couple of minutes when compared to values from Intellicast, etc.

4 - The temperatures and humidities seem accurate compared to other measurements I have.

5 - Even though it has a 'rain cap' the external sensor must be out of direct rain fall such as under the eaves.

6 - The oak trim is just a vinyl decal on plastic. Nobody is going to confuse it will real wood.

However, in spite of my criticisms I think it is a good unit for approximate weather monitoring

Proof positive that you don't have to hanging under a palm tree on a white sandy beach to fully appreciate the hammock experience! These hammocks are perhaps the most blissful place one can rest, and it really doesn't matter  whether they are hung between support walls in your living room or strung  between two trees in the backyard. I have spent countless hours perfecting  my hammock posture and in the course of this perfection have test-driven a  whole bunch of hammocks. I can, with absolute certainty, tell you that this  hammock is the stuff dreams are made of. It is constructed of a durable and  soft cotton that breathes with you and doesn't cause itchiness or that  unpleasant &quot;Plastic&quot; feeling. When it is strung up right, you can  either lay horizontally or vertically - it matters not because it's  amazingly comfortable either way. Some of my most peaceful sleep and  dreamiest dreams have come from hammock-induced slumber. I strongly  recommend it for any and everyone considering their sleeping alternatives.  The hammock isn't banished to the tropics anymore, and in fact looks just  great in my Kansas living room. Trust me - get a little tired and get a big  ole hammock! This one in partiucular will make your socks roll up and down

I bought this for my Weber Q because the cover designed for the Q just didn't cut it.  It was too small and I didn't like the fact that it didn't cover the stand or the utensils I have hanging from the grill.  While this cover is a bit big, it covers the grill, stand and tank just fine.   I think the heavy duty weight will do just fine in the windy and frigid Chicago winter.

Just like everyone else says, this really is a great product.  True, you can use a cheap stand with a real "beer-can" but with since it collects all the juices it makes it well worth it.  Cleanup is easy, chicken comes out very, very juicy and it cooks faster since you are also cooking from within.  When I first used it my wife and I were amazed how better the chicken tasted.  This is the best way to cook a whole chicken on the grill!  I use it on my gas grill and charcoal grill.  However, make sure you don't buy too big a bird or you may have trouble closing the lid.  That's not of fault of this product since it would be the same with any vertical roaster.  Buy this for you or as a gift!  It's great!

We purchased this roaster for my father.  He made an excellent chicken with it last weekend.  It provides a nice sturdy base to set your chicken on and allows you to add veggies, beer, wine, etc very easily.  I was very impressed on how it held and chicken and the ease of removing the chicken once done cooking.  We have a very cheep "beer-in-the-butt" holder and the Weber Roaster was much more stable and easy to use.  I do not give it 5 stars because it set the chicken so high, the lid to my fathers Weber Charcoal Grill would not fit.  However, he was able to rig a smaller grill rack to sit lower in the grill and it cooked fine.
We had great chicken

I love grilling vegetables and I have quite a few grilling baskets for different purposes. I got this for veggie. The size of the basket is good, enough for 4 adults. The lid is flipping on the narrow side and I found it could be awkward when you open it and try to serve the food into the plates. It just hang and I have to lift the basket really high or ask my husband to help to hold the lid. It's relatively easy to clean. There are some hard spots when the grid overlaps. Again, I wish the lid was removable rather than fixed on the narrow end

Ho, noble comrades! `Twas time again for the Fellowship Fan Club to host its Annual Sauron Scavenger Hunt. As ever, the goal was simple: Club Chairman Solun Fangtooth (my neighbor, Glen) took thine replica One Ring, authentic down to the Mordor Elvish inscribed around the band, and hid it in yon forested creek behind his parents' abode. The five new members of the cabal, myself included, would comb the wilderness in search of this mighty treasure. He who was first to unearth Sauron's golden band of evil would be promoted from rank of Hobbit to the Council of Elrond, and get to choose the location for our next screening of all three LOTR films.

The rules of the hunt are simple: any method is allowed, provided it can be justified as the tactics and materials of a fantasy character.

 The other four fledglings, cloaked in robes of Rivendell and carrying Torches of Truth (in the form of flashlights), scoured the wooded gully, seeking some minor clue of Fangtooth's passing. But having shared a road-trip to ComiCon with Fangtooth, I knew him to be a wily foe - it would take wits, not persistence, to uncover the location of the One Ring.

To this end, I unsheathed mine ultimate weapon: the Bounty Hunter Quick Draw II Metal Detector. A gift from my patriarch for the passage of boyhood to man, I had honed my skills at alloy retrieval on the sands of Hilton's Head. Finding 64 in Coins of the Realm, I knew the path to advancement lay in the probing waves of this device.

Setting the proper adjustments to compensate for uninteresting metallic flotsam (nails, etc.), I knew the rhythmic beeps of the Quick Draw II would lead me to victory. In practiced, methodical sweeps of the search coil, I combed the creekbed, finding the One Ring in a shallow pool, partially buried in the silt. Victory was mine. My own.

Of course, there were protestations at my ingenuity. Some argued that the technological marvel of the Quick Draw II was outside the boundaries of our club charter. However, I deftly explained that the very name of this product led me to adopt the perfect fantasy persona: I was a bounty hunter - one who used any means necessary to achieve his goals. I was Bilbo Fett!

This set of cleaning tools is some of the best money I've ever spent.  In fact, I just returned to order a third set.  The first for me, a second set for my mother-in-law, and another set for me as a spare since I don't want to be without this product.  I've never had such an easy time cleaning my ceiling fans and my vaulted ceiling.  Great value for the money, and I've only used 2 of the attachments

The Weber grill has always been the Cadilac of BBQ grilling.  It is a quality good - it won't rust and will last a decade even when left outdoors.  Its other claim to fame is the ability it offers to "shut off the charcoal" as it is air tight.  The "one touch" system just makes it even easier.  Instead of having to close three bottom vents seperately (and fumbling with hot surfaces that cannot be easily seen), you just flip one lever.  You make up your mind yourself about the silver vs. gold models as both are good.  What size do you need?  What do you want to cook?  A turkey? - better get the 22 1/2 inch size.  If you have a chicken or a roast in mind, the 18 1/2 inch will do and it will save you some fuel to boot

After looking for a good grill and surfing the web for a while, I read the reviews about this one and I thought lets try it.
Installation of this grill was really easy, you don't need any specific tool.
Let me say that I didn't have any experience with grilling but this grill is incredible, it holds the heat perfectly and you wouldn't end up having black and burned or even raw meat. 
The meat is really juicy and delicious.
I think that I got a great deal, I even didn't pay for shipping!

This is just what you have been looking for.  A dependable, accurate device to be aware of the tempatures that concern you. Available are extra remotes so you can monitor as many as 3 stations. Even one with a probe so ou can monitor freezer tempature, or tempature in fish pond.  Reliable, easy to work on but you need to follow instructions.  Good price

This may be called a roast holder but you've missed out until you have used one to cook a turkey.  You can cook up to a 14 lb. turkey easily in a 22-1/2 inch grill using this rack.  I cooked my first turkey in a Weber 21 years ago and have cooked at least two every year since.  There is no comparison if you want a moist tasty turkey.  My family would mutiny if I tried to cook a turkey any other way and my wife loves to have her oven available to fix the rest of the holiday dinner.  Maybe one day I'll try cook a roast but I wouldn't trade this rack for any other way to cook a turkey

This small, light-weight, portable, durable charcoal grill is perfect for cooking for a few people.  It wont work for a giant dinner party, but if you fire it up for a couple of steaks or a few chops, nothing beats it.  I will be cooking on my Smokey Joe for many happy years to come

The Weber Smokey Joe Grill is a real performer. We are so pleased we purchased one of these. We cook a lot on the grill weather permitting. The Smokey Joe Grill fires up quick. The Smokey Joe Grill also cooks up burgers, hotdogs and steaks evenly and in short order to perfection. I really mean it. We love it. The food is ready in no time. The Smokey Joe Grill is really an efficient unit and is quite innocuous in appearance. It is quite mobile and seems to fit anywhere for use or storage. It is actually quite amazing. We have noticed that we use less charcoal, lighter fluid, save time, get better tasting food and save time on cleanup. We own two depending on how much we are going to cook. The smaller units are perfect for two people or a third or even a forth if somebody happens to stop by.

It's a very durable grill that should last years, if not decades.  At this size, it's strictly a grill -- you won't offset-cook on this. 

A note: Weber grills are made to be used with the lid on, always. If you cook without the lid on, you lose temperature control, the fire often gets too hot and you get the old burned-on-the-outside-raw-on-the-inside syndrome. With the lid on and the vents in use, Webers are the best charcoal grills at temperature control in my experience...although the smaller the grill, the harder it is.

I think Weber still makes the slightly larger version of the Smokey Joe -- one with an 18.5-inch grill. That will give you a lot more flexibility while still being very portable. It's possible to offset-cook chicken for two on an 18.5-inch grill but probably not on this one.

And finally, this is not for use on your apartment balcony. That's illegal in most places and most assuredly dangerous. Even if you have a concrete balcony, sparks can waft away from your grill and set something else on fire

This fork thermometer takes an accurate temp reading; and is a good deal for the price. It does have one quirk -it has a button to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit which I keep accidentally hitting when I hold the fork. So I end up reading the temperature wrong because it has inadvertently changed to Celcius.  Just be aware of this and the fork will work fine for all sorts of cooking

The item showed up nearly a week before I was expecting it. Due to its weight, the free shipping was an added plus. The delivery company actually placed the grill inside my garage which was very helpful again due to its weight and the size of the boxes. The directions provided to assemble the grill were vague and very difficult to interupt. The directions indicated to plan about 30 to 40 minutes to assemble. It took almost 2 hours and I am very mechanically inclined. Once assembled the grill worked perfectly. If I had to do it over again, I would buy this grill, but would love to have better directions

This is a great tool for the grill. It is the easiest one to use I have found. The readout is a grid which tells you how done any piece of meat is based on the temp - this allows you to check different things on the grill (i.e. chicken and beef) without having to reprogram the fork.  Plus the readout is backlit and it has a light to help when grillin at night.  The only negative is that it is not water resistant so you have to be careful washing it.  I got water in mine when washing it one time, and now it is somewhat temperamental - sometimes when checking the temp on the grill, it goes blank, and I have to pull out my old one to get a reading.  I still recommend this one - just be careful when cleaning it!

This is a good addition to a patio space when an umbrella stand is needed, as the design and color of the base blend in with most newer outdoor furniture.  The base is sturdy and solid and comes with five rubber feet that are screwed into the base for added stability and for leveling on uneven surfaces.  The diameter of the base's stalk holds most patio umbrellas, but be sure to measure the diameter of yours first before ordering this size (1 3/4" diameter) instead of the larger size available elsewhere.  Contrary to the original description of this item, however, the weight is NOT 70 pounds.  It's closer to 61 pounds without the stalk and 63 pounds with it.  (UPS recorded the weight at 67 pounds, not the 73 pounds claimed in the description.  The package dimensions are also smaller at 25" x 25" x 4".)  Also, the diameter is NOT 28" but is 22" - 23", so be aware of that as well.  Had the description here on Amazon been more accurate, I would have rated the item higher..

This is a very handy item.  It can be lowered or raised according to what you need.  I needed it to hold a tabletop Christmas tree at the holidays and it was terrific. Now I used it as a lamp/end table with a decorative tablecloth and topper. The item is very sturdy, much more so than the little round tables you can buy to act as lamp table. I bought a smaller one for my office to expand my counterspace.  It can be folded up when I don't need it.

This dandy should be available year-round; it does everything it's advertised to do, plus looks Great and is comfy to sit on, too! Easy to assemble (no tools needed). Would be neat if it were available in many other solid colors, but the cream color is nice and neutral. Its totally waterproof, as promised! It's unavailable now, but I would seriously consider buying another when it is again available! Cattle dogamine also likes to sit on it

Hi Folks, I want you to know,you just can't go wrong with this Pitmaster, I can Grill on it. I can Smoke on it. My wife surprised me with it in 96' since then,I have slow cooking ribs, and the usual hotdogs and hamburger.And I have even ROTISSERIE a 12 to 14 pound Turkey on it (my own design) to do this, the shin is crispy all the way around...You just can't have a REAL Bar-B-Q without a Deluxe Pitmaster..If you really like outdoor cookin' this is the way to go...

I bought the (apparently identical) Charbroil from Lowe's for my son, because it was rated so highly by Consumer's.  I had the opportunity to cook on it twice, and was very impressed -- very even; very controllable.

So, I bought one for myself from Amazon, and am still impressed.  I think the reviewer who commented on the bad packing may have received a received a return.  The packing on mine was good, with everything plastic bagged; no scratches, finish looked OK.

Assembly is not for the light-hearted, but the biggest problem was the assembly instruction sheet.  Not very clear, uses "beside" where it should say "inside"; makes no mention until 3/4 of the way through that there are different lengths of screw, and does not differentiate between regular and sheet metal screws.  However, I had no real problem, but assembly does take 1 1/2 - 2 hours.

I thought the construction was quite good.  Certainly nothing is much stronger or heavier than it needs to be, but this means that the grill is no heavier than it needs to be!  When assembled everything feels very solid.  I did take the wheels off and reinstall them after completing the frame so that I could tighten all screws when the frame was fully assembled and squared.  Probably not necessary, but it only added about 30 seconds.  Next time I would delay installing the wheels for a few steps.

I give five stars because I do not know of another grill in this price range that is as large, has so many features, and cooks so well

I have been looking at grilles for over a year now, i had to retire my trusty Quickset. for all the features, size and quality, this one cant be beat. Assembly was very extensive, but if you have ever put anything together that was more complicated then a pizza box, you can put this together. Packaging wasnt the best, but mine was in really good shape, so i cant complain much. it looks better, has a larger cooking area, heats more evenly, heats more quickly, and is easier to clean then my fathers $1400 grille, and mine has the griddle that his lacks.

if you are looking for a solid all around performer then this is the grille for you.    if you dont know how to use a screwdriver, and dont have the patience to assemble anything, then either pay someone to do it, or chose some thing alittle more basic, like a quickset model

Seems to be a quality product, but as others have already mentioned, the instruction booklet is seriously lacking.  For one thing, there is no Index, nor Table Of Contents.  I have spent about an hour trying to figure out how to engage the alarms for outdoor High Temp, etc., to no avail.  I guess I am just not hitting the right buttons, or leaving them depressed long enough.  I WAS able to calibrate the barometer to match my wall-mounted barometer and I have to admit - it works VERY well.  I enjoy too the barometric histogram, covering the last 36 hours.  

Because the booklet doesn't explain, I am still trying to figure out what the percentage factor of the "Forecast Index" really means, and why it sometimes is presented as "12 hour forecast", and other times it is 24 hour forecast.  

Because the outdoor sensor is not waterproof, it becomes a bit of a challenge in locating the device to where it will be protected from rain, and direct sun exposure, etc., and yet be out in the open for a true reading, so as to not be influenced by warmth radiating from the house.  La Crosse ought to strive for a waterproof sensor someday

I have 4 more atomic clocks (2 more analogue and 2 digital ones) as well as 3 atomic watches. Self setting function works exactly the same on all of them. So I think it's worth setting the expectations straight for how this clock will most likely work for you. Unless you live close to Colorado (where the time signal originates) the proper way of 'setting' this clock is to put the battery in and wait overnight for the clock to set itself. Best signal reception depends on where you live and also on time of year and weather conditions. In Charlotte, NC where I live - most of my atomic clocks and watches sync themselves around 2 am. I guess it's a bit confusing to people unfamiliar with the 'atomic' technology to see the hands of the clock start moving around and then stopping at some random hour as if though the clock was broken... La Crosse (and other makers) should probably include a 'quick start' card that states in big bold letters to put the battery in, select your time zone, IGNORE any hand movement (or lack there of) and then WAIT overnight. Again - unless you live close enough to CO so that the clock can receive time signal any time of day or night - you will have to wait until the next day.

I've had this clock for around 6 months now and it worked perfectly well (to within 1 second of actual time) with the exception of a couple bizarre quirks. One time the clock got itself off by 15 minutes (though the seconds hand was dead on). I did not adjust it - and the next day it fixed itself through its usual overnight self-setting. Another time it spontaneously changed time zones and started showing California time. This time around I had to remove the battery, reinsert it and re-select the time zone (simply re-selecting time zone did not solve the problem).

As another reviewer remarked - the clock looks nicer 'in person' than it does on the photos. The very thin rim makes the dial look a bit bigger than the stated dimensions would suggest. Face color is off-white or very light cream and looks very nice. As for the build quality - it's nothing special. The clock is 100% plastic (even the 'crystal') except for the dial which is simply paper. The whole thing - including mechanism - is made in China. Even though the clock is probably extremely cheap to manufacture (given its all plastic construction) it does not LOOK 'cheap' once it hangs on the wall. I bought a virtually identical quality atomic clock for seven bux (delivered) on everybody's favorite auction site and it looks OK - but not as nice as this one (a different 'brand' - not La Crosse).

One star taken off for the 'quirks' - but  not for the 'good enough' materials engineering (it would be better if it was made less cheaply - but it looks fine the way it is).

This lounge/deck chair cushon is worth every peny. It is thick, comfortable (none of those deck chairs are comfortable without a substantial cushion), available in several color choices, and has a soft, not plasticky, cover fabric. You will have to measure the width of your deck chair carefully to see if it will fit. It just barely fit my 'titanic' deck chair because I had to scrunch it up a bit near the arms. But all turned out well and I must say I am very happy with it. It is a quality product and will keep you much more comfortable during your hours on the patio than those cheaper, but much thinner, types sold at outlet stores or supermarkets in summer. Get the best. This is it

There are plenty of detailed reviews both PRO and CON so I will keep mine brief. I just want to chime in on the PRO side. For the $185.00 incl. shipping I paid at Amazon it is well worth the price. Now, if I were paying closer to four or five hundred I would go with the Davis. But, again, for the price I am plenty pleased. 

P.S. Be sure to download the Radio Shack manual. It is a must

So far great product.  I had no issues setting up.  Just follow the directions and give it time to lock onto the local time clock.  I have my remote about 100 ft from my house and it is working fine.  I like the display.  I would avoid the alarms you set, as they go off and keep beeping until you reset.  My alarm went off at 1:00 am and I was wondering if it was some alarm clock I forgot.  Took a while to figure what was beeping at that time in the morning

I've had this unit for about a month. Before buying, I visited the manufacturer's site, downloaded the instruction manual and read it through. It's important to learn as much as you can about the product before buying, especially site unseen over the 'net.  A picture never tells it all. 

Very easy to set up. Just pop in the batteries (in the proper order, of course) and you're up and running in minutes. The only adjustments were the city location and LCD constrast. Be sure to shut off the alarm unless you REALLY want to notified of  every temp/humidity change outside your preferred range. Mount on the wall if you have little hands or pets who might be curious. Good performance and accuracy for the money

I got this product when my old weather station died.  As others have said, it is a bit bigger than you would anticipate, but not overly huge.  I hung it on my kitchen wall and the silver/black finish fit in nicely and now doesn't taker up counter space.

The weather station works as advertised.  It is very accurate... a lot more accurate than my last weather station.  It is very nice to have the clock update automatically via the atomic clock in CO.  Set-up was easy.  Price here was less than E-Bay and had free shipping!!  I highly recommend this to anyone who was looking for an affordable, entry level weather station

I have had great results with this feeder all summer! The hummers found it immediately and many, many hummers come here to feed.
The multiple ports seem to make the difference, and the glass orbs are easy to remove, fill, and keep very clean; I prefer the glass to plastic. This feeder is whimsical, fun to look at, and as for our local hummers; they seem to love it

I bought this product for myself a couple of years ago and love it. It's attractive and it does attract "hummers". Liked it so much that I bought one as an anniversary gift. Unfortunately when it arrived, one of the glass feeders was broken. It is being used that way, with the two remaining feeders, and my brother and his wife still think its great (though I was unhappy at sending a broken gift!)

What a great clock.  I was more than pleased with this purchase.  I was looking for a clock to put outside (I live in south Florida) on my pool deck so I could tell the time without having to either go inside in my wet bathing suit or take my watch outside. This clock is suitable for outside or inside use.  There is a twist off cover on the back of the clock over the mechanism to help make it weatherproof.  I installed it under cover of the eaves to give it some protection from the weather.  No tools are required to install the battery.  It takes one AA battery.

Not only is this clock very attractive, it keeps absolutely perfect time because it sets itself by the atomic clock in Denver at least 6 times a day.  I was most impressed when daylight savings time ended in October and the clock set itself BACK an hour during the night and was perfectly on time the next morning. 

On the back are 4 buttons for setting the time zone.  Simply push the button for your time zone to tell the clock where it is. All I did to set it up was install a battery and set the switches and hang it on the wall.  It did the rest.

As an added plus, it has an analog hygrometer (% relative humidity) and an analog thermometer that appear to be very accurate as well.  

I am very happy with this product and highly recommend it as a stylish addition for either indoor or outdoor use

I like this clock. This is a night stand alarm clock. And it does what it is supposed to do very well once it is set up.

The set up is not intuitive so you HAVE to read the manual and do exactly as it says. But it is not really hard to set up it's just not easy. You have to think about what you are doing. By the way the manual is large as another reviewer commented but it's because the instructions are in several languages not because it's so complicated.

The reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is that the plug which the AC adapter plugs into, which allows it to project the time continually, has too much space on either side. The result is that you THINK the AC adapter is plugged up properly when in fact the adapter has gone down on either side of the plug. It took me a while to figure out what was going on. At first I thought the clock was defective as some of the other reviewers did. That's a bad design flaw that needs to be fixed.

FYI it doesn't project the time continually in battery mode because that would quickly drain the batteries. In battery mode it only projects the time for about 3 or 4 seconds when you press the snooze button.

Once the clock is set up for your time zone you never have to set the time again, not even for daylight savings time, and you always have the correct time. The clock has a built in antenna that picks up the radio signal from the official U. S. government time keeper. Once a day it sets itself according to that radio signal. It also has sensors that tell you the indoor humidity and temperature.

Door mat looks good and sturdy.  Seems easy to maintain.  Does not lay flat against my tile portch, if that is a draw back

I gave these to all of my family members for Christmas.  I ordered 20 in all of the various colors.  All of them loved them and commented on how heavy and durable they were.  They are really unique in their color and styling.  This has got to be one of my better purchases.

This fork is great for a barbeque, because it's really strong and grips the food well. It also washed really easily, which saves a lot of time

We have a 7 month old lab who loves it. Its the only toy that we have tried that he can't chew through. And he chews through almost anything (tennis toughies, raw hide bones, etc etc). He has had it for 3 weeks and is still as fascinated by it as he was on day one.

I bought four of them for my front and back yard three months ago. They have been working well keeping the moles away, although the range is not a large as stated. I dug the hole for eash one and packed the dirt around the mole chaser I have an acre and a half of yard and I do have mole activity in the far back of the yard I will buy three more to cover that area. If you have a sandy yard I don't think that they would work as well

I bought this product about a year ago and it worked great.  Unfortunately, I placed it at the edge of our lawn and ran it over with the lawnmower, breaking it instantly.  After ours broke, I waited to order a new one.  I told our neighbors about my success and they all bought them, since ours was broken the moles all moved back to our yard.  Needless to say, I bought a few more.  They work very well, you do need to put the battery replacement on your calendar for every 6 months

Love it - the water sparkles in the sun light and the birds in my yard are already digging it!  The petals from my Cherry Blossom tree have fallen into the bath and are floating on top.  It is a piece of art in my yard.  You need to leave a little room on the edge of the bath so the smaller birds can enjoy the water as well. I know it will be enjoyed for years to come.  A wonderful gift my daughter gave me for my birthday.

Very simple to assemble - two steps.  The base is also weighted so it will not tip over and is balanced.  I have to see what other items are from this company.

This works well enough for what my son wanted. I threw a bunch of nickels out in the yard and he had a blast finding "treasure." Still hasn't found a chest of gold, though. But it is hard to adjust sensitivity and it makes annoying sounds.

After reading the reviews here, I decided to try a ZaGrill.

It works.  It works as claimed.  It works very well.

This is a wonderful addition to my grill gear, unlike some of the rubbish I've bought.  It has enhanced my standing as Grill King of the family.

Now I find myself thinking, why didn't I invent something like this

I really like the clock.  It works like a charm.  The only reason I took off a star was because the controls aren't as intuitive as they could be.  I keep having to go back to the instructions to figure out how to set the alarm.  Shouldn't it be obvious

This is great furniture folks. 
Many times I have thought that Amazon hired people to rave in these reviews but I cannot say enough about how nice this furniture is!
I bought 4 chairs, the settee, and b/c they don't have a side table in the Bainbridge pattern I bought the Shaw table with the ice pit.
I have recommended these to everyone, lol, the price has gone up $10 every week for the past 2 weeks.....get em while their hot

We are delighted with our new chairs and table.  The products were well-packed and came in excellent condition.  The chairs are sturdy, ample and comfortable even without the cushions.  The cushions that come with are very nice, but too thick for my liking.  The chairs have an additional feature of leveling pads on the bottom of each leg that can be screwed in or out to accommodate uneven surfaces.  The table is big enough for a full dinner for four, but small enough to still feel intimate. We now spend a lot more time on our patio

Never has grilling of meats and vegatables been done with such ease and success as it has been with the Brinkman Electric Grill and Smoker.  I have finally been able to say adios to burned meals.  I grilled a 23 lb. turkey that when cooked looked like the most beautiful stage prop ever used in an advertisement and tasted as though a professional cook had done the cooking.  I now own two Brinkmann Electric Smoker and Grill units.  One for the California home and one for my Alaskan summer home.  I can't leave home without one

I bought this item to keep track of the humidity in my apartment because I have a number of wooden musical instruments.

I read the review before I made the purchase. I was afraid that my wife won't like it but it turned out that my wife like this elegan garden bench too. This is the very few item I could remember that my wife like as she always thought that I spent money on useless junk and inventory for garage sale. Thanks to Amazon's special promotion (I bought it for around $120) to gain me some credit from my wife

This mitt works fine for me. I was worried that the size would be too small after reading the previous review. I don't have forearms as big as Popeye, but I am a 300 pound man and I have no problem with the fit of this mitt. This mitt really comes in handy when I'm dumping the hot coals into the grill

This is a fun product. We connected three at a time to make necklaces rather than using one as a bracelet. We found that it was somewhat difficult for kids to make the bracelet, as the connectors would occasionally split.

I ordered these glow sticks for Halloween treats instead of giving the neighborhood kids candy.  My husband and I were really impressed with the brightness and the length of time that the "glow" effect lasted.  We will deifinitely order these again.  We couldn't have been happier with the product, its performance, and the joy it gave to the kids and their parents

Let's face it, if you are going to spend over 1000 dollars on a grill, you need one very good grill cover and this fits the bill perfectly.

Not only does it protect the grill's sheen and surfaces, it actually hugs the grill and the grill shape still looks attractive, even with the cover on.

Also, we can't let anyone forget that the grill and cover were made by Weber (the best grill company on Earth) so, it has a good sized logo on the cover for everyone to be uber-jealous of!

All-in-all, a must-have for the Summit 625 and Summit 650 grills

I got this as a gift for my dad, and while the shipping was on time and I got the proper product, the packaging was not suitable for giving this item as a gift.  The box in which these tongs arrived (the actual product box, not the cardboard shipping box) was all dented and had weird stickers on it (I am assuming for some sort of inventory purposes from whatever warehouse this came).  Anyway, my dad isn't one to care about that sort of thing, but if I were to have given this to anyone else, I would have been embarrassed.  Neat product though.  Very handy.

BUT...it is ideal for us...we were going to get the mosquito magnet (which lots of our family/friends/etc...have), but then saw that not only do you spend money up front but have to buy all kinds of things for years to keep it going...so we figured we would start with this then if it didn't work we would move to that...love the technology description on the website for this etc...and when we hooked it up it seemed to work instantly...who knows that the weather didn't change or different soap we were using, etc..??? but one night we were sitting getting eaten alive by mosquitoes the next we plugged it in and we weren't....so....we weren't going to unplug it and find out! esp. with our three little kids to protect from them!

This EasyGreen automatic sprouter is an amazing machine!  I had used the jar method with mixed results.  My busy schedule prevents me from being able to attend to sprouts as needed.  I decided to invest in an automatic sprouter.  I am very happy with this unit.  It was a good investment.    I personally feel that it is worth every penny.  

The set-up was easy, thanks to the clear directions provided in the manual.  It is very well built.  It allows you to connect several units together if you wish to expand its sprouting capacity.  It is made of a few components which can easily be replaced when they wear-out without having to purchase a new unit.     

The unit is connected to a timer (provided) which activates the mist generator for 15 minutes at a time.  I followed their suggestion to set up the timer for 7:00am, 10:00am, 1:00pm, 4:00pm, 7:00pm, 10:00pm and 2:00am.  This has produced wonderful results!   You can set the timer to a different schedule if you wish.

I put my automatic sprouter next to my kitchen sink which makes drainage very easy.   I had to fill the 5 liter reservoir manually every day until I decided to purchase the Automatic Water Filling System (AWFS).  This accessory can easily be added (you have to purchase it directly from EasyGreen).  It makes sprouting even easier than before.  

The unit comes with one big tray (for sprouting a great quantity of one thing) and 5 smaller elongated trays that can be used together(each tray grows about 2 cups of sprouts)  I put seeds in tray #1 and put it in the growing compartment of the machine.  The next day I seed tray #2 and put it in the compartment next to try # 1.  So on and so forth with each of the 5 trays.  On the 5th day, tray #1 is ready to be harvested.  I then re-seed it and put it back in the machine.   I also sprout beans and greens which have a different growing period.  (I keep track on a piece of paper of the type of sprout I am growing in each tray and what day it will be ready for harvest).  This unit basically allows you to sprout something different everyday.   

The EasyGreen gives you the option to sprout hydroponically or in soil.  I have not tried the soil option yet.   

I am totally impressed with this unit and I strongly recommend it to anyone interested in purchasing an automatic sprouter

This alarm clock has some nice features. It has two separate alarms, and each one makes a different buzzing noise. It also tells the temp., and shows different time zones. The only draw back, as other reviews have pointed out, is it does not project well with light. This doesn't matter in the night, but in the morning it would be nice

I bought this grill to replace a dying Charmglow model several years old. It had several features my wife and I insisted upon in our next grill, namely stainless steel grates, 3 burners, and a stainless steel finish. All in all, it has done marvelously in cooking everything we've tried from steaks, chicken and fish, to a full 30 lb. turkey. That bird came out perfect! The three controls are easy to use, the lower storage compartment is roomy, and all the parts are made with quality in mind. My only complaint is the arrangement of the burners, which are top to bottom (or, front to back, if you prefer) as you face the grill. A side to side arrangement would make indirect cooking much easier on the rectangular-shaped grill area, where you could have one burner off and two on, and still have plenty of room for whatever was cooking. Assembling it was a bit of a chore, and took me and two of my buddies about an hour and a half. One note of caution: READ THE INSTUCTIONS CAREFULLY AN PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE ILLUSTRATIONS!! We didn't, and didn't realize our assembly error until we were a third of the way though the job. No biggie, but this is the second grill I've put together, and they don't get easier. Bottom line: Weber makes the best gas grill of this type in this price range. I expect it to last 10 years with care, and am very glad I bought it

After gilling on an undersized two-burner Char-Broil for ten years, I decided it was time to upgrade to a Weber.  I have used the gril now for a few weeks and it is the best - for direct grilling, perfectly searing steaks, grill roasting, and even slow barbecuing.

If you're looking at this grill, you're probably also considering the other Webers, like the Genesis Silver B.  Go with this one.  For the price difference of about $100, you get the steel Flavorizer bars, a double layer stainless steel hood, a bigger storage area, and dual work surfaces.  A note on the design:  I thought that the LP tank is housed inside the cabinet below the grill - actually it is under the right work surface (not a big deal, but hard to tell from the photos).  The only down-side are the stainless steel cooking grates (extremely durable, but not the best for either conducting or retaining heat), I prefer cast iron for its heat-retention, so I picked up some porcelain-enamaled cast iron grates at a certain big box orange home improvement store before the grill even arrived.

Cooking on this grill is heaven.  We like to barbecue (low and slow, with wood chips in a smoker box), and this grill handled the task wonderfully.  On my old grill, even on low, the wood chips would ignite and turn to ash in about 15 minutes, giving the food a nice sooty flavor.  On this grill, even though it gets very HOT very fast, on medium the wood slowly smoldered just like it is supposed to do.  Great smokey flavor.  We'll be doing our Thanksgiving turkey on it this year!

Sure, this grill is a little pricey, but the quality means you won't have to replace it.  In the long run, a great deal on a high quality product

This is a great reading chair in reclining position. Then you can straighten it up, grab your computer, take a few notes, and kick back to recline, all with minimal effort. I got two of these black chairs for our uncovered deck last summer. The mesh dries off quickly after rain.

This hinged grate easily allows you to put in extra charcoal or even move them around while still cooking food.  The original was quite frustrating, you easily could drop your food onto the ground while trying to access the hot charcoals.  While one should have bought the larger grill for cooking beyond several people, I'm stuck with my 18 incher and the hinged grill is a must have, I can guarantee you can't live without it or you'll always say I should have bought one when it's too late to do s

I always have to chuckle when I see the phrase "atomic clock". I am sad to report that there is nothing about this clock that is "atomic" except the name (well, it's made up of atoms, so I suppose that is worth something). However, it does receive the WWVB radio signals from the National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Boulder, CO.
On the bright side, if this clock is typical, WWVB receivers have improved over the years. The last "atomic clock" I bought before this had some difficulty with reception. This clock does very well. I've owned it about 3 months, and I have placed it in several bedroom locations and gotten the "strong signal" indicator in all of them.
The external temperature feature also works well. Some external sensors and receivers I have owned have had difficulty connecting. This one has done perfectly at all locations where I have tried it (my sensor is located in the frame of a bedroom window, and is currently about 15' from the clock).
The clock is, to my mind, easy to use and set. I like that it has battery backup, and I like the ceiling projection (my wife loves that feature, BTW). The projection is bright enough and large enough that even a nearsighted geek (20-200) like me can see it without glasses when I squint. I also like the tasteful level of the alarm. The clock we threw away when this one arrived had all the subtlety of a nuclear power emergency alarm annunciator.
Overall, I like the clock and gave it to my wife after much hinting. It now sits on her side of the bed. She got it last week after saying "I thought for sure I'd get one of those for Christmas after all the hints I dropped."
I'd buy it again. In fact, I may end up buying another one.

The first thing I noticed about the Big Kahuna was the quality of the construction.  After a simple assembly process taking about 10 minutes; I fired it up and was amazed how powereful the burner was.  An average home stove's burners produce between 9,000 and 14,000 BTUs -- The big boy produces up to 65,000 BTUs (according to Eastman).  If that doesn't get your wok to turn red hot then nothing short of a jet engine will.

On the subject of woks; I didn't buy one from Eastman and I'm glad I didn't.  I'm sure Eastman woks are top quality but I have a very good reason for my statement.  Lodge makes an iron wok that is not only less expensive but also fits into the Big Kanuna like a key in a lock (with minor modifications to the burner's rack).  The base on the Lodge Pro-Logic 14-Inch Cast-Iron Wok with Loop Handles not only works great on the Big Kahuna but it also sits nicely on your stove thanks to it's flat bottom.

OK, the world isn't perfect so the Lodge wok didn't fit into the Big Kahuna's grill out of the box.  In order to make it fit, I filed down the four cross members of the grill about 1/8" on each side and now it fits like a glove.  This is a huge advantage over a curved bottom wok because the wok simply can't move and is much safer to use (considering the high temperature of the cooking surfaces this is a big plus).  Let's face it: nobody wants to hold their wok in place while cooking if this can be avoided.

I also recommend that you get an Eastman Stainless Wok spatula (also from Amazon) -- it's almost a requirement.

The only thing I would change on the Big Kahuna would be to add an electronic ignition.  I'll probably add one myself using outdoor grill parts.

Keep in mind that the Big Kahuna, the wok spatula and the Lodge wok are all available from Amazon which means that free Super-Saver shipping is available from Amazon -- resulting in a considerable savings on these heavy items.  You could easily pay twice as much elsewhere.

The weather meter shows temperature and moisture level in a room.  It has a large digital display that I can see across the room.  I don't know about the temperature; but the moisture level number "seems" to kind-of match what is shown in my humidifier.

The bottom line is that it is cheap and good, and I bought two of them -- one in each floor.

I've had several wireless atomic weather stations and they all looked somewhat cheesy in an obvious spot, so you find yourself tempted to hide it away and this of course defeats its original purpose.  The LaCrosse model matches our kitchen cabinets and is wonderfully functional.

A friend of ours lent us their outdoor fireplace and we liked it so much that we tried to find it online.  After a little searching, we found it on Amazon.  We ordered it immediately, and the delivery came in about a week.  It was fairly easy to assemble, and was very durable.  I like it better than others, because all sides have removable screens, so everyone can play with the fire.  The "only" critisism I have for it is that the fire-grate is fairly low, so it's difficult to put paper under it to light.  Also, it's best suited for short logs, as there is a bar that crosses either end that limits the size that can sit on the grate itself.  Otherwise, it's a well designed, and well thoughtout product

The part was first quality and fair priced. It fit my grill perfectly since it is made by Weber for my grill. The site is easy to use and the information is very reliable.I recommend getting stainless steel because they generally last much longer than the other types.A Weber grill is an item that,if cared for properly,will last for many years.So why not improve yours and move up to stainless steel- I did

My Weber was purchased in 2001 and has served me well.  The grill has never been covered and I live within 1/4 mile of the beach.  Eventually the elements corroded the original burner, especially the small cross-over tube.

Installation was much easier than I thought (15 minutes) with no special tools needed.  Now the grill and griller are happy again.  For less than $50 I've extended the life of my $550 grill by at least 2-4 years

Bought this unit primarily for brewing beer; the turkey fryer parts are a bonus for me.  The burner delivers a lot of heat to the pot, and there is plenty of regulation available for the burner.  However, I'm disappointed in the thinness of the pot material as I hoped for a more sturdy pot.  Some apparent tousling during shipment caused a significant dent in the pot, but I was able to pop it out.  Bottom line, though, this is a terrific value, about 40% lower than if I had purchased all components separately

This hammock stand is very strong and durable. It was easy to assemble. The only drawback it has is the cross bar at the bottom of the hammock when put together.  Before the hammock stretched out it easily turned over and you would fall on the crossbar.  We bought a piece of foam pipe cover and placed it over the bar to prevent anyone else gettting hurt from falling off the hammock

If you are a caterer or own a restaurant,then you probably can effectively use the 22" wok. I loved the idea of a huge wok, but failed to anticipate the challenges it brings:
1. I couldn't season it in a standard oven. I had to resort to using the burner to season it by turning it. It was a laborious experience.
2. I can't easily clean it in a standard sink. Good thing I'm cooking next to the hose.

Get the 18", or search Amazon for "Wok Shop" and get a 14" or 16".

Other than that, after spending 1/2 a day manually seasoning the wok, I've just cooked the best fried rice of my LIFE

I purchased this stainless grate set as a replacement for my 15 year old Weber Genesis 1 gas grill... my only regret is not making the switch to stainless sooner.  This grill has been a mainstay for my grilling for many years now and rather than buy a new grill, I chose to completely rebuild my grill - starting with the burners and finishing with the grates.  Amazon.com was extremely fast in fulfilling my order (free shipping for me ended up with the product on my door step in 3 days!!!).

Take my word for it, do not but the cheaper enamel grates - you get what you pay for.  My 15 year old grill will be "good to go" for another 15+ years

This burner is stainless steel and is very easy to install/replace. The orginal burners were almost 15 years old. We use our BBQ grill several times a week so it gets a lot of use. I would highly recommend Weber to anyone considering a new grill. Their customer service has been fanastic and their warranty great. As I said our grill is almost 15 years old and I see no reason why it wont last another 15. The red top looks like new. The cheaper grills don't last long and don't cook as well. We have cooked turkeys, hams, roasts and even baked with it (during power outages). It cooks very evenly and can cook at low heat or indirect heat unlike some other grills that are too hot even on low.

I bought 2 sets of these chairs and the matching table.  I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived.  They are quite substantial, without being heavy and their appearance is quite nice.  The chairs came with no assembly and the table was very easy to put together with the provided allen wrench.  The feet on the chairs are adjustable so that you can get rid of the iritation of off-balanced legs.  Overall this was an incredible value at approximately $650 for the set.  I was so impressed by the quality and price that I have since ordered the matching bench

I have had this weather station for about 4 weeks. It is working properly and does all the promised functions. Setup and installation were easy the manual covers all the needed points and has some good insights. The included monitoring program works well, but is not too deep and is difficult to modify or reprogram. 
Overall I am satisfied with this product and I would recommend it.

I bought the bounty hunter for my 9 yr old son and he has used it at the beach, sandbox at school, hiking trails, playgrounds to find bottle caps and pennies mostly.  It beeps when it detects metal and works very well.  We even dug up a mountain of beer cans at the beach... about 20 buried in the sand.  It is light weight, easy to use and detects very well

I just received my two chairs! I just placed an order for two more! I did a ton of research on patio lounge chairs - pricing, quality etc.  These chairs stand head to toe with restoration hardware, crate & barrel, pottery barn.  They are the perfect weight.. not too heavy, not too light.
They look VERY expensive. WOW - sometimes I think these review are written by the manufacturer because they can be so glowing at times.. but I am just a customer so pleased that I got these and that they are this great. I was prepared to spend $555 per chair from Restoration Hardware.. but I got two for less than the price of one.  Only other thing I would add though.. the cushions are not fantastic.  I am thinking about ordering more comfortable ones with the all the money I saved

This bag is awesome, I can't believe we waited this long to get one. The ad states that the bag will fit a 9ft tree, which is what we have, and it fits fine. You just have to take your 9 ft tree apart into the 3 pieces, then it will fit (don't think other reviewer did that). The ad should probably make a note that you have to take a 9ft apart in order for it to fit. Am going to order a 2nd one right now for our other 9 ft tree.

This is a great way to monitor the temperature in another location. It can either be inside or outside, but it must be within 60 feet of the main unit. Walls or other obstacles can reduce the distance. You can monitor up to three different locations.

The only problem I have encountered is that the main unit sometimes loses track of a remote unit. However, it always automatically found the unit within a few minutes.

This unit works well. The 90 foot max range is for a direct line of sight. Walls and obstructions can reduce this distance significantly. 

Oregon Scientific makes a number of main units and remote sensors. They do not all work together. Check their web site for which remotes work with which main units before you buy: http://www2.oregonscientific.com/service/sensors/default.asp.

The material is heavy duty canvas-like.  Very substantial.  Design is also good with the cinching cord and the straps that attach to the legs of the fire pit... but the thing fits snugly enough that I don't plan on using the straps.  I liked it so well when I got it that I also ordered the grill cover.  I liked it just as well.  These are great products for the money and are as nice as any covers I've ever seen. Note that they ARE a light tan color, though.  It took a few weeks to get used to that and not the black covers that I had previously had on my fire pit and grill

This is a nice addition to anyone's patio. The product came very well packaged in heavy duty double boxes with the legs wrapped in padded paper. Assembly took around 30 minutes. As others have commented the holes don't line up naturally and did require some "finessing" in order to get lined up, but really wasn't that difficult to overcome. All that is required for assembly is a 4mm allen wrench which is provided (although the end started to get worn 1/2 way through the assembly and required me to use another wrench). Probably one of the nicest features of the table are adjustable levelers on the legs. This seems like a good quality that I am confident will last for many years to come

I bought the whole Bainbridge collection and gave it 5 stars.  The table was exceptional also except for the manual labor of constructing it.  One of the drilled holes for the top didn't line up but I have a garage full of tools which helped me correct this problem.  Plan on having someone around to help put this together, it is a little difficult for one person - not impossible, just difficult.

Being an afficianado and collector of buckets, I was ecstatic when I came across this 2 Gallon Galvanized wonder.  It's beauty and wonder cannot be overstated.  It is quite simply the Mercedes-Benz of buckets, if I may say.  I ordered this amazing product and the days spent waiting for it were probably the longest of my life.  When it finally arrived, I eagerly ripped open the box and tore off the paper covering the Dover Parkersburg 610.  All the packaging wasn't even necessary, because this bucket folks, hold on to your hats, is made of METAL!  That's right, 100% metal.  As advertised, it is quite capable of holding water, but that moniker is far too restrictive.  This versatile container can hold equal amounts of *any* liquid you can think of.  To test it's claim that it holds two gallons, I went out and bought two gallons of buttermilk from my local dairy vendor.  I poured both gallons of creamy goodness inside the 610, and to my surprise, it held both gallons!  Then, of course, I faced the problem of having to drink two gallons of buttermilk.  Long story short, the 610 was able to handle the resulting two gallons of vomit!  Days later, when I got out of the hospital, cleaning the 610 was no problem.  The galvanized surface made cleanup a snap.  I have found countless other uses for this versatile bucket since then.  Highly recommended

When researching metal detectors before buying a Bounty Hunter Tracker IV for a Christmas gift, I learned that using earphones with the detector not only makes hearing the "beeps" much easier, but also extends the battery life of the battery in the detector.  We live in a windy, windy canyon area, so I knew the earphones were a necessity because of the constant wind noise.  My husband says that the earphones effectively screen out noise that would overpower the emissions from the detector if he weren't wearing the headset.  He's a happy camper with his Bounty Hunter Tracker IV and the Bounty Hunter stereo earphones

I bought these headphones to use with my Bounty Hunter Metal Detector. They do what they are designed to do. They help cut out outside noise and make it easy for you to hear those faint noises that are important when hunting for underground treasures. It takes a little bit of getting used to, but after a few days they are quite comfortable. Remember, they are for use with a Metal Detector only.

Purchased my first THGR168 Remote Sensor in Sept. 06 and a second sensor in Feb. 07.  They flawlessly send their signals to the Oregon Scientific BAR388HGA Weather Station.  I've yet to replace the alkaline batteries in either THGR168.  A third sensor (THGR122N) came with the weather station and is set up outdoors using lithium batteries; it has measured down to -25 degrees F during its first winter.  When I first got the sensors, I set up all of them side by side for a day.  The units measure temperature (C or F) within a tenth of a point and humidity--if the humidity is below 40% or above 70%, they also show 'dry' or 'wet' in the unit window.  A tiny red light flashes each time the signal is sent. I noticed that the temperature readings were fairly close, within a degree or so of each other.  The humidity readings were further apart, as much as 5 percentage points.  With 3 units, one outside, one in an attached garage and the third unit currently in the kitchen, it's a nice benefit to see the temp and humidity directly on the sensor as well as at the base station.  Using the wire stand that comes with the units, they can be easily moved from place to place.  There's also a wall mount for more permanent installation.  Reception has been excellent through as many as four walls and two floors; units are within 40 feet of the base station--I think Oregon Scientific claims reception up to 100 ft.  Only the outside unit's signal occasionally disappears from the command weather station--that signal navigates 4 walls.  Move the command station to a slightly different angle and the info reappears.  In average or better lighting, the read-out is easy to view.  An improvement might be a backlit button to see the LCD readout in dim light.  Being in direct sunlight or shade will affect the readings.  These digital units work well.  I wouldn't claim them to be precise instruments but they are generally accurate; nowhere in the specs does OrgSci make a claim concerning precision

We're happy with this sensor.  It works great.  We're a little worried about it holding up when it goes outside, but the info on it says it will be fine.  I'd buy it again

I have had this unit for 2 years.  I had to replace the wind sensor under warrantee but other than that, I have been very happy with the unit. Wireless tranmission between the sensors and base unit doesn't happen quickly enough.  A direct wire connection updates every 8 seconds.  If you buy this unit, plan to run a wire from the sensor to the base.

If I had to do it again, I would buy this unit.  For under $200, you can't get more data.

One note - Humidity range is only 20% - 95%.  When it rains, humidity is really 100% but registers 95

We got our first GardenJewels window mounted Hummingbird feeder going on 6yrs ago. We have so enjoyed the birds right at our kitchen window. The birds get so use to you that they even continue to feed as we are at the kitchen sink right by the window. They are a hoot, they know who feeds them!!! We have gotten several for gifts for friends and they are all surprised and delighted with this product....It is so reasonably priced for such a great feeder!!!

I too had trouble at first and gave this feeder a bad review but after fully reading the directions the brackett with suction cups separates from the bottle . I suggest you clean the window fully , which I did and it has never come down , been up for at least a month. When you refill hold the brackett in place with one hand and slide the bottle up and off with the other. It also does not leak. Since the brackett separates from the bottle it is very easy to apply suction cups to window. Forget all that about rubbing the suction cups with friction to make it stick

When I first sat in this chair, I was sceptical.  I didn't think it was going to hold me up, and I thought it was going to be very uncomfortable.  Boy was I wrong!  This is more comfortable than my rocker/recliner in my living room.  The foot rest takes a little to get used to, but overall this is a great chair.  I can easily fall asleep in mine

I bought the whole Bainbridge collection and gave it 5 stars.  The table was exceptional also except for the manual labor of constructing it.  One of the drilled holes for the top didn't line up but I have a garage full of tools which helped me correct this problem.  Plan on having someone around to help put this together, it is a little difficult for one person - not impossible, just difficult.

This is a very nice looking and sturdy table.  A nice extra is they ship a small bottle of touch-up paint with the product.

The table may look nice now, but getting there was a pain in the neck.  On the positive side - it is very well packaged.  No worries about any damage during transport - not a small issue for many items.

That said, the instruction sheet included was for a different (rectangular) table with completely different legs.  Even if it was for the same table, it was in that hard-to-understand translated-into-English-using-a-dictionary vocabulary.  There was a nicely vacuum packed card with all of the bolts and washers, as well as an appropriate wrench that fit the bolts.  Unfortunately, there were 12 bolts in two sizes and 12 washers - but 16 holes waiting for bolts in the table.  All of the bolts were too long for any of the holes - even with the washers.

I ended up getting a bunch of extra washers and few shorter bolts at my local hardware store (if you need to do this make sure you get stainless steel so rust will not be a problem).  The bolts provided required between 3 and 4 washers each before they could be adequately tightened.

Whew - finally done.  The table is serving us well on the patio.  It replaces a glass topped model which flipped over and shatterred in a big wind last fall.  The open weave design is nice - very easy to clean the top.  Give me a couple of months to get over the trauma of assembly and I might give it 5 stars

I love to BBQ!   Hauling a conventional smoker and grill in our RV was both messy and awkward and took up too much room.   The Cobb Grill is the perfect answer for RV owners who are short on space but long for fun and flavor.
In addition it is one of the safest cooking units available and disposal of ash is easy and clean.  For travelers this ease of use and clean up is very important.   In addition you can cook a whole meal at the same time in a Cobb!   It is also one of the least expensive cookers there is out there and all in one small compact unit

I gave this as a gift to my Mom...she loves it and says she can lay back in it like a hammok. My Dad has also tried it. They had it put up on a tree in less than an hour after they recieved it from UPS. Mom says she can take it down and put it up easily without Dad's help. When a storm hits, this is a good idea. After visiting the folks,  I find that it It fits me(at 6' 2" and 275 lbs) I can now rate it five stars.  dispite the thin(looking) ropes, this thing could fit a circus elephant it's so strong(Hehe)

THIS CLOCK IS THE BEST !!!!    WE ONLY USE THE FOLLOWING FEATURES AND NEVER CHANGE THE SETTINGS:  TIME: PROJECTED ON THE CEILING.  OUTDOOR TEMPERATURE:  PROJECTED ON THE CEILING.  WEATHER:  PROJECTED ON THE CEILING.  IT IS SO PERFECT TO ROLL OVER AT NIGHT AND SEE THE TIME ON THE CEILING IN LARGE NUMERALS......WITHOUT SQUINTING ON LOOKING FOR OUR GLASSES !!!  OLDER FOLKS USUALLY HAVE TROUBLE READING THE CLOCK DURING THE NIGHT WITHOUT THE AID OF THEIR GLASSES......NOT WITH THIS CLOCK

as others say...the unit is very nice, but needs three major improvements.

1.  Needs to run completely on A/C power when available.  Right now, the batteries are the primary power source and A/C is used only for the projection light.

2.  The alarm could be a little louder.
3.  There is no way to make the backlight stay on permanently
