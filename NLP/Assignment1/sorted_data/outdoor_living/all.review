$80 for this?  Seriously overpriced.  If you can find something cheaper buy it, this is not worth 80 bucks.  Clamps were not capable of holding a small boneless ham without slipping.  Worked well with ribs

This seems like a great idea - the food is held in a basket, so that you don't have to shove a skewer through the meat. However, the little bolts that hold down the clamp onto the rack are meant to be tightened by hand. If you have a sizable chicken, you cannot tighten these enough by hand. I had the chicken fall out of the rack into the flames more than once. Then you have to tighten them with pliers, but the metal is so soft that you can only do this 2 or 3 times, and then the threads are stripped and the whole thing is useless! Again: hand tighten = chicken falls out; tighten with pliers = threads are stripped. Now I have to try to get replacement parts for the rotisserie from Weber. Good luck

For me, the LaCrosse Technology WT-3122A 12-Inch Wood Atomic Analog Clock is of little value.  I talked with a friend living in Colorado who is very satisfied with an equivalent clock, but I am in New York and much further away from the transmitter and it just doesn't work to my satisfaction.  When it was first put on the wall in the kitchen and didn't work for several days, I contacted technical support.  They suggested I put the clock in a window.  I followed their suggestion and after 2 days the clock was set correctly.  I moved it back to the kitchen wall and now 7 days after the change to daylight savings it's still on eastern standard time.  I didn't purchase this clock to hang in my window.  I need a clock in the kitchen.  As soon as I can find a suitable replacement this one is going into the garbage where it belongs

The third time I used this brush it broke.  The wood split diagonally at the neck of the brush, a little  before where the bristles start.  I now have the perfect implement with which to stake a vampire.  My other Weber brush (which I purchased at a diff. website) is still intact and works okay.  You see the bristles are a little gunked up -that's why I bought this second grill brush.  -Buyers, and Vampires, beware

This seemed like a pretty slick idea, and was a pretty clock.  All it needs to do is let us know that our stomachs aren't lying, that it really is near lunch.  
I set it near our front (glass) door and it apparently found a signal as it had changed time by itself and was spot on.  So I hung it in our office (no window).  Two days latter we had a thunderstorm one night.  Apparently that can interfere with the signal.  Rather than sit tight and wait for a fresh signal, this thing was off by an odd amount of time, like an hour and 27 min by the next morning.  

I set it manually, and today it's off again by about an hour.  

The instructions to reset which I got from Tech Support were not less than 7 steps long and included a detailed disertation on what type of battery, and what it's expiration should be.  

Man, that's a lot of work just to verify what my stomach knows is true.  For $25, and the packaging being gone, this is in the dumpster.  I'll get a regular clock that only keeps time to a couple of minutes a month....but takes a month to show the error

The radio controlled "atomic" clock is not based on a mature technology.  Mis-communications could happen quite often.  The programmers did not build a robust program to check and eliminate these mis-communications (a very simple task).  As a result, the clock could display wrong time randomly under certain conditions, and therefore could cost the user big damage.  I have three atomic clocks.  They had displayed wrong time at least 20 times in the past year.  Sometimes this happens simultaneously to two clocks--they showed two different times and both of them were not correct.  Since there is no way to turn off the radio receiver, the clock simply cannot be trusted.  Using a regular clock, at least I know it is within a few seconds to the real time.  Using an atomic clock, I don't know anything about the correctness of the time it shows.  My atomic clocks were off 35, 65, 120, 60, etc. minutes many times (sometimes ahead, sometimes behind).  Today, it made me got up an hour earlier in the morning.  It showed 6:00am when I looked at it.  It was raining and was dark.  I got up and took a shower.  When I came out of the bathroom, I payed attention to a regular clock in my kitchen.  It showed 5:05am.  After I verified with the time showed on my watch, I realized that I was cheated by the atomic clock AGAIN.  What a wreck

    I was very disapointed with the smoker cover.  It is made of a very THIN plastic that is simular to a medium guage garbage bag material.  This type of cover needs to be able to be resistant to some heat, weather, and also some general scratching.  Just taking the cover off requires real tender care or you will get a quick split in it.  The company needs if necessary to charge more for the cover and make it more durable.      Sincerely yours,  Allen Vest III

Don't waste your money (even just 10 bucks).  The plastic is not rip-stop and tears very easily.  I will now just use a big, heavy duty, black trash can liner - they are much stronger

I normally BBQ 8-9 racks of ribs at once, for our annual party.  Thought that this Weber rib rack would make it easier.  However, I found that it was more of a hinderance than a help.  I like to baste my ribs with lots of sauce, several times, so I have to remove them from the rack for basting.  Getting the ribs in and out of this rack was a pain.  If you're going to load in the ribs and just let them slow cook, then it might be useful.  But, that's not me, so I gave my Weber Rib Rack to my brother-in-law.

Outdoor clock?

This seemed like a pretty slick idea, and was a pretty clock.  All it needs to do is let us know that our stomachs aren't lying, that it really is near lunch.  
I set it near our front (glass) door and it apparently found a signal as it had changed time by itself and was spot on.  So I hung it in our office (no window).  Two days latter we had a thunderstorm one night.  Apparently that can interfere with the signal.  Rather than sit tight and wait for a fresh signal, this thing was off by an odd amount of time, like an hour and 27 min by the next morning.  

I set it manually, and today it's off again by about an hour.  

The instructions to reset which I got from Tech Support were not less than 7 steps long and included a detailed disertation on what type of battery, and what it's expiration should be.  

Man, that's a lot of work just to verify what my stomach knows is true.  For $25, and the packaging being gone, this is in the dumpster.  I'll get a regular clock that only keeps time to a couple of minutes a month....but takes a month to show the error

The radio controlled "atomic" clock is not based on a mature technology.  Mis-communications could happen quite often.  The programmers did not build a robust program to check and eliminate these mis-communications (a very simple task).  As a result, the clock could display wrong time randomly under certain conditions, and therefore could cost the user big damage.  I have three atomic clocks.  They had displayed wrong time at least 20 times in the past year.  Sometimes this happens simultaneously to two clocks--they showed two different times and both of them were not correct.  Since there is no way to turn off the radio receiver, the clock simply cannot be trusted.  Using a regular clock, at least I know it is within a few seconds to the real time.  Using an atomic clock, I don't know anything about the correctness of the time it shows.  My atomic clocks were off 35, 65, 120, 60, etc. minutes many times (sometimes ahead, sometimes behind).  Today, it made me got up an hour earlier in the morning.  It showed 6:00am when I looked at it.  It was raining and was dark.  I got up and took a shower.  When I came out of the bathroom, I payed attention to a regular clock in my kitchen.  It showed 5:05am.  After I verified with the time showed on my watch, I realized that I was cheated by the atomic clock AGAIN.  What a wreck

    I was very disapointed with the smoker cover.  It is made of a very THIN plastic that is simular to a medium guage garbage bag material.  This type of cover needs to be able to be resistant to some heat, weather, and also some general scratching.  Just taking the cover off requires real tender care or you will get a quick split in it.  The company needs if necessary to charge more for the cover and make it more durable.      Sincerely yours,  Allen Vest III

I normally BBQ 8-9 racks of ribs at once, for our annual party.  Thought that this Weber rib rack would make it easier.  However, I found that it was more of a hinderance than a help.  I like to baste my ribs with lots of sauce, several times, so I have to remove them from the rack for basting.  Getting the ribs in and out of this rack was a pain.  If you're going to load in the ribs and just let them slow cook, then it might be useful.  But, that's not me, so I gave my Weber Rib Rack to my brother-in-law.

I purchase my unit a little less than one year ago and now I am shopping for a different brand.  It worked fine for the first summer season in Texas, but now that it is spring almost summer--it does not turn on at all.  I have completed all of the manual's troubleshooting in addition to purchasing a new bulb and cable for it.  But, it does not work anymore after only 1 summer usage!  I do not recommend!!

After twice sending the unit back to the factory, the unit worked for two weeks and again would not turn on.  I tried all the suggestions made by the factory.  The following year I opened the unit and tried to see what was wrong.  I found totally frozen fan bearings.  I suppose that the cartriges to repel mosquitoes are corrosive and corroded the bearings.  To end my agonies with the unit, I took it to the garbage dump.  The unit is cheaply made and therefore unreliable.  When it worked, it worked well.  I believe it cost me about one dollar per killed mosquito

Essentially a one-season, lightweight, hibachi that doesn't stand up to extended use.

So, at $12 it's too expensive but may be worth about $5

A handle was missing - the box was retaped - may be a return from a store, etc.
Overall, the item is chintzy - you have to assemble it.
The charcoal pan is painted black - this will burn off slowly.
I am going to assemble it, but this item, when shipping is included, is a total ripoff.

Sometimes it doesn't pay to start your holiday shopping early. I bought this in October as a Christmas present. When my husband took it out of the box on Christmas morning, it already had a rip in the seam. I couldn't exchange it through amazon (see return policy) so I tried to get an exchange through Char-Broil. Their website was having problems so I couldn't resolve the issue online. I was on hold for 96 minutes after calling their 1-800 number. The lady was nice, but unfortunately she didn't know if she could help and had to send the request "to the top." I'm still waiting to hear back. It could be a perfectly fine grill cover, but I may never know

While the clock works quite well and resets as it should, the wireless outdoor thermometer is way off. I base this on two other wireless brands I own,an Acu-rite and a Oregon Scientific, along with the local NOAA weather broadcast, also WFIE TV. The Acu-rite temp=18.2 F, the Oregon Scientific+18.5 F,
and the NOAA broadcast temp @ 20:09 Jan28/07 = 18F, Local TV station WFIE-TV=18F.  [...]

As I write this, The Weather Channel also reports it is 18 degrees F at 20:30.

    The La Crosse WS-8256U-AL reports it is 23.5 F, more than 5 degrees off. In my opinion,a clock/thermometer costing this much should be dead on.
 Buy it for the time, NOT the temperature

I loved the idea of the electric heating. The "ease" of temperature control, etc... but the heating element melted. The plastic part of it did anyway... right where it conects to the metal bent "rod" that creates the heat to burn the wood chips.

It also was a pain to constantly snug the wood chips (even tried the chunk type woods) against the heating element. Which ment I had to balance the housing, the water bowl, etc. just to get where the heating element was at.

I don't know about other electric smokers, but this on "stank".

Just get one with a smoker box on the side... toss in some coals, wood... whatever... as needed. Don't try to make the unit too "scientific"

I have had this smoker since August and have a total of 20 hours smoking on it. I noticed that the thermosat was starting to burn out after 4 hours of use and by hour 20 it was gone rendering the smoker useless. 

The other problem I have is that the porcelain coating inside the cooking chamber has all pealed off leaving bare metal exposed.

Dealing with Charbroil to get it repaired or replaced is useless.

At the start it was a nice easy to use smoker but with the problems encountered I would pass for something better

I loved this smoker the first two times I used it but after the third it stopped working as well and by the fifth it didn't work at all.  After examining all the parts, I noticed that the thermostat had burned up around the contact points.  It was under warranty so they sent me a new thermostat but I was forced to pay the shipping!  I used it once and examined the new thermostat and it had already started to burn around one contact point after just one use.  I think I'll go back to my charcoal grill

After experiencing the same thing that many on here have witnessed (after 8 hours the smoker didn't get hot enough, and I had to finish my meat in the oven), I decided to ask Char-broil support on their website what I can do to remedy the situation.  

Their answer, and I quote, "Thank you for your response. To purchase replacement parts, please contact Grill Lover's at 1-800-241-8981 24 hours a day 7 days a week to place an order. We apologize for the inconvenience. If you have any further questions or concerns, please let us know."

WHAT??  They expect you to purchase a replacement part in order for their POS smoker to actually work??  What's a warranty worth??  BEWARE - this thing is worthless without some modification or purchasing expensive spare parts

This is a beautiful piece of B-B-Q sculpture and gets one star for looks alone, but it bends too easily at the 'neck' and I'm already looking for a replacement after using it only 2 times!  Looking back at the original information, it stated that there is a lifetime guarantee against defects. I wonder if a snapped off head would be considered a defect. I will let you know what happens. Too bad about the brush. It looked so good with my stainless steel weber...

I've had an old Weber for 15 years - still works well! However, as it was getting too small for my growing needs and starting to show its age, I "upgraded" to this model.
The new one has more bells and whistles - I do love the smoking burner/box combo. The rest of the features are nice too. However, this thing is almost impossible to get to 500 degrees to sear a steak or do some other high-temp cooking! It runs through a tank of propane in just a couple of serious days of cooking and once you're at less than 3/4 tank, don't bother with high heat - it's not there! 
On the other hand - very few flare-ups and mid/low temp cooking is great

I ordered this piece and the matching chairs.  I have waited since July for them to be available.  They became availabe in September, so I ordered them.  They kept moving the delivery date and then canceled the chairs - said they couldn't get them.  So I  had to cancel the sofa as well. Now I am stuck with 2 chaise lounges and a coffee table but no other furnitue!!

Don't let the size of the box fool you.    Even though this item comes packaged in a good-sized box, this product is barely one inch by two inches.  It's just a small piece of plastic with some type of pheromone embedded in it.    Although it does seem to attract flies for a few days, it doesn't seem to last for very long at all.   It's just a tiny piece of flimsy plastic!  In my opinion, it's just not worth it

After opening the weather station and setting it up, I noticed that the numerical display was not readable with missing "characters".  I contacted Amazon and returned it.  Within 5 days the replacement arrived with the same problem.  When I contacted them again, they would not replace it again, saying that the "batch" they have must be defective.  I was not aware that Amazon was selling the "seconds" from other retailers.  A phone call to LaCrosse remedied the situation.  They advised me to send in the defective unit and they will replace/repair it and make sure it is perfect before leaving their premises.  They further advised the "fail ratio" with the problem I had with both units is less than 1%.  Beware if buying this from Amazon

I guess I must have had the same mindset as Adam in the previous review.  I too set up the main unit and the remote side by side to see if the readings from both units would agree, along with another very accurate digital thermometer.  After six hours, the temperature readings from all of the units were within one degree, but the humidity readings from the remote unit were lower by 4 to 8 percent as compared the humidity reading from the main unit... which is 3 to 7 percent too much IMO since they were side by side.  What good is having a relative humidity function if you cannot trust the readings?  I will return the unit.

Also, on my unit, the front wood bezel apparently had a small defect and it was repaired (from the factory) with a wood filler type material... but the defect was still obvious

I purchased this item a few weeks ago to mainly kill fly's. It seemed that this wasn't happening as there were fly's still around and no evidence of fly's being killed. At night there would be a lot of flying bugs getting zapped though the noise would make you jump every time. It scared my Labrador Retriever to the extent she would not go outside after dark. The final straw happened when a young squirrel laid dead underneath it with no marks on it at all, I could only figure that it had got zapped. I finally switched it off and hung-up some zip lock bags with water inside, now there are no fly's and no interference with the ecology of our garden

I bought this thing and put it in my garage for about a month. One night I saw a mouse running across my stove so I brought it in and put it directly on the stovetop. Later that evening I was washing dishes, and the mouse ran back and forth from behind my microwave with his little cheeks full of Shake'n'Bake RIGHT PAST THE RODENT REPELLANT FIVE TIMES!!

The repeller works fine at repelling, but when on the "rodent" setting it makes an audible chirping noise that's annoying so it can be used only in remote locations where people don't normally go.

The reason we bought this model was because it can run on batteries and we wanted it for an outer shed, but the manual says that it'll only run two or three days on battery power, making it absolutely worthless for this use

I can utterly guarantee that this thing won't work. I was employed in the pest control industry for 16 years. We used to find cockroaches living in such devices all the time (it's usually nice toasty warm in there). Sanitation, exclusion, and very careful application of pesticides is what you need.

Rodents are sometimes repelled for a brief time, but quickly adapt (adapting to environmental conditions is one of the things rats do best). Again, count on sanitation, exclusion, and traps; try to avoid baits because you'd rather know where the little s.o.b. died (i.e. in a trap, rather than in a wall somewhere)

When I first got this home, it seemed to do the trick ok. The mice really avoided it, however we could still hear them across the room. I was going to order a couple more to place around the room, but they walk right past it now! It doesn't seem to affect them at all! For $20 it's not a bad deal because obviously it works for some people, it just didn't work for us:

Misunderstood directions, made mistake of putting all sides together instead of a level at a time.Cracked all sides trying to take apart. Called 800 # and asked what they could do for me and they said Buy another one, they're not responsible. Also found out the box had two right side upper levels and it will take 7 days till the left side is sent. Suncast will never get my business again and I hope my warning will discourage others from doing business with this company

I bought one of these summer 2005. This unit runs way too hot to use as a smoker (easily 250-300 degrees F). I even got a replacement regulator from the mfctr, but both ran too hot. I've had some success controlling temperature with valve on LP tank and a C clamp on the gas hose, but only limited luck. I've tried using an electric hot plate burner, but that only worked in warm weather and barely got above 200 degrees. Hate to say it, but would recommend you invest your money elsewhere.

I was disappointed with these tongs, which was surprising since OXO makes good kitchen utensils.  I agree with other reviewers, it is difficult to grasp and close them.  Unless you have a rather large hand (which I don't), you're forced to grasp the handle so far down near the stainless steel!  When comparing these to my 12" tongs my hand grasp was at the same point - which really made these 16" tongs no different from the 12" ones.

aside from the nifty weather prediction, this clock is completely impractical.  The projection numbers are about 1/2 inch tall with minimal clarity.  The clock itself has a greenish background that only comes on if you press random buttons which makes knowing the time during the night almost impossible.  I am surprise this is sold on Amazon.  Thank goodness for Amazon's customer friendly returning policy.  I think Amazon should remove this clock and others like it for good.

The good news is that it mostly works--although the weather forecast is, as advertised, only about 75% accurate.  Unfortunately, it has some annoying flaws.
1) Although it will provide either 12 or 24 hr format and either Celsius or Fahrenheit temps, you can't actually select the temperature display--once you select 24-hr time format, you get Celsius temps whether you want them or not.  If you want deg F, you must select 12-hr time.
2) If you run the clock off batteries, you have to press a button to get any projection.  Unfortunately the button you press is the snooze button, which activates both the projection and the backlight; the button to control brightness of projection does not work in battery mode; activating both lights simulaneously is both redundant and wasteful, as it runs down the batteries more rapidly than necessary.
3) Worst of all, the device emits a very annoying, very audible, high-pitched whining sound any time any button is pressed (including the snooze) and anytime you need to set or reset anything.
4) Manual confusing; information on website did not tell me anything I needed to know.  Emailed support--no acknowledgement, & although I eventually got a response it wasn't remotely helpful, and I had already given up on them and returned the device

This product is a waste of money. The mice in my room are completely unaffected, and walk right by the device without any sign of concern. Besides being ineffective, the devices themselves make a slight buzzing sound (not silent as advertised). I now have to buy a set of (humane) mousetraps, and I recommend that anyone reading this do the same and save themselves $40

My smoker arrived dented and chipped, which I wasn't happy about but I could live with -- I don't expect a relatively inexpensive outdoor oven to maintain its new look after some wear and tear anyways.  However, the rails along the sides that hold the shelves are not welded together well.  In fact, two rails arrived completely broken off (opposite sides and at different levels) and a third was tenuously held in place by a single weld.  I thought that the broken-off rails were parts to be used in the oven's assembly; otherwise, I would not have unboxed the smoker and put it together.  I would have returned it. 

Because I had assembled the unit before realizing that it was broken, I thought that replacing the broken parts would be easier than disassembling the unit, re-crating and returning it.  I called the distributor three weeks ago to order replacement parts that have not yet arrived.  I've already waited longer than the distributor indicated I would have to before receiving the parts.


If alternative gas-fueled smokers didn't cost a multiple of what this costs, I'd be really angry.

Hands down, this is the most unsatisfactory purchase I've made from Amazon.

In spite of the impairment of not having a fully functioning smoker, I have seasoned it and used it once.  The chicken I made was promising. (My hope that my experience with this smoker will improve lets me award a rating of 2 stars based on this one use.) If I ever get the parts I need, I think the smoker will be adequate for initial experimentation with this kind of cooking.  If I like the results, I'll replace this smoker with a better one

I ordered The Great Outdoors Deluxe Gas Smoker in anticipation of a summer of barbecue.  Unfortunately, the unit arrived structurally damaged.  Based on the state of the box, I would say it occured prior to UPS picking it up, but have no way of knowing.  Sadly, the replacement unit was also damaged.  There were huge dents that broke the welded seal.  I gave up, have requested a refund from Amazon, and will seek a different brand of smoker.  I would definitely advise not to buy this product

In theory this is a nice set, and I like all of the different tools -- but I bought this as a gift, and I'm going to return it.  It just looks too cheap.  The wooden handles are chipped in some places, there's almost no finish on them, and the plastic case is really flimsy and cheap looking.  Perhaps if I was buying them for myself I wouldn't mind, but I'd be embarrassed to give this as a gift

I live in a apt in nyc, so roaches are very common problem. After a long battle I finally got rid of the roaches in my place, but I cannot escape the bugs visiting from other apartments. I thought this device could help with that problem. Also, I don't like to use the spray too often or have all the baits, gels, and other poisons around, so I decided to try these things. Unfortunately, they don't work. The first week I bought them I saw a big roach crawl under the door and walk directly under the repeller straight to the dining room. The ultrasonic frequency did nothing to it. Instead of this repeller I use Limonel (orange peel oil) is a safe alternative to use when children are present, and it does repell and kill the bugs.
So, how to get rid of roaches? Seal every crack nook and cranny with expansive foam, wood sealer, etc. Mine came in through the bathroom and kitchen vents, so I put mosquito screens to block their way in, also I sealed the gaps between the wall and the electrical outlets in the apt with silicone and I bought a plastic stripe that closes the gap between the door and the floor. Also, my husband sprays once every 4 months with repellent. Good luck

I bought these things because I really hate silverfish in my apartment. Before I used them I only found silverfish in my bathroom. At first I put a big one (for large room) in the living room and one week later I found a silverfish on the wall just 1 foot distance from this repeller. After that I got two for medium room and I put one in my bedroom and one in my bathroom.  Several weeks later I found one silverfish in my bedroom (near the repeller) then I thought these things might be pest attractors. So I unplugged the one in my bedroom and put it in the kitchen. But I still found silverfish in my bedroom and bathroom, and living room, but no one in the kitchen until now. Hmm, now I think these stupid things are just night lights.

As the title says, the remote sensor died a quick death so I got a replacement unit. The remote sensor died on that one pretty quickly as well.

I know that sometimes things go wrong with good products, but two sensors dying so quickly apparently was not a fluke. This is a cheaply made piece of equipment, so I guess you get what you pay for.

I gave a friend an Oregon Scientific unit three years ago and it is still going strong, so I'd advise you to stay away from La Crosse and go with Oregon Scientific

It arrived fast enough, but I should have sent the chair back. It's pretty cheaply made, the ends are taped with what looks like regular scotch tape. It's OK, but I'll keep my eyes open for a better one. And we won't swing on it. I don't think it would take it.

No way chair could be converted to 7 foot hammock as advertised. I should have read advertisement closer. I could have gotten 100% cotten chair for less. This ad didn't state the material used.
I could buy from this company again I'll just pay closer attention

We got this for our deck last May and it started to rust almost immediately. I took it down in August to store for the winter. Tried to assemble it today (mid April) and two parts fell apart in my hands. Save your money

Looks nice when it was standing. Took several hours to erect doing it by myself. Had 20 mile per hour winds and the thing broke apart and I had to throw it all out. Wrote to the company because it was only 2 weeks after I received it, and heard nothing back. So, if you live in an area that has a low to no wind factor it is a good buy. But if not say goodbye

Mine showed up broken.  

It seems that a single "string" on a pulley is what is used to raise and lower the umbrella via the crank.  The string in mine was broken off (not connected) and inside the main pole.  Not a great design for lasting a long time in any kind of weather.

I'll try another brand

I'm very unhappy with these lights. I placed them along the planter in my patio a couple feet away from the fence in full sun, but they didn't work at all.

We set them out in the middle of the patio, and now five of them do work for a little while, but they don't accomplish their purpose in that area. They're also in the way. One of them has never worked at all.

I gave them the old college try for a month or so, but now it's too late to return them, so I'm stuck with them and out my money

After buying two automatic retractable Hozelock 50 foot hoses (that we love) I bought this for the extra hose length.  It is a very disappointing unit.  It tends to bounce around when you are pulling out the hose and can be a pain reeling it back up.   I am a big guy and still struggle with it.  Pull the nozzle back to the unit as instructed and then sit on it as you crank.

Regarding the comments about it only taking the original nozzle I cut off the end and put on a std US hose fitting

When my house painter couldn't figure out how to use the nozzle, he somehow took apart the hose and lost one of the parts.  I looked everywhere on-line for a replacement part, but could not find anything.  Finally, I called Hozelock in New York and they sent me a replacement part.  They charged me about $6 for shipping a part that cost about $3.  The system can't be used with a regular sprayer or a regular sprinkler.  Also, it is hard to reel the hose in.  Overall, I don't think this item is worth the cost.  If you need to call Hozelock their number is 1-800-297-7461

Bought the Driveway Patrol and had nothing but problems with it.  It constantly went off, no matter how many times I moved it around.  Also, when a car drove INTO the driveway sometimes it wouldn't go off!!!  Talked to the Telebrands people and after having to pay shipping to send the first one back, they replaced it free.  However, it worked just as bad as the first one.  NOW they refuse to refund my money!!  This product is an absolute ripoff and I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy.  I agree with the other review that they would give it a minus 10 stars!!  I suggest you beware of any other products you might want from Telebrands.

Worked OK for about a day and a half, then it would go off every few minutes for no reason. Changed batteries several times, to no avail. Changed position in case squirrels or cats triggered it. Moved it from place to place, even watched the scene, and still sounded the alarm for no reason. This is a piece of junk that will drive your dog crazy. !!! AVOID !!

Outdoor remote temperature sensor is not weatherproof.  Instructions state "The remote temperature sensor should be placed in a dry, shaded area."  The battery cover has slits in it that will allow water to enter the unit.

Do not buy this planning to leave it outside on your grill! There were warnings with this product saying that it shouldn't be left outside, but I figured it couldn't be that bad. A couple months later, I discovered that my cutting board (left on a covered porch through a mild California winter) had completely split into several pieces. For a $30 outdoor product, this is really unacceptable. A plastic or metal cutting board would have worked much better

The chair has good back support and fits a 6 ft tall man well with even a little extra wood to support the head.

My stool arrived with the wood split so check it before the driver takes off if you can.

Mind the instructions when you are putting it together.  If you don't watch the bolts and the small blurry print on the step by step notes you can get turned around.

Also, the wood is almost orange in it's color

These lights don't hold a charge.  I called the manufacturer and they said that these are "summer/spring" lights that require 12 hours of direct sunlight to work.  The ad on Amazon did not say that.  I even charged the batteries using a wall charger and they still barely held a charge (1 - 2 hours).  They are also very dim lights.  Don't waste your money

It does not like rapid changes in temperature.  When the sun stops hitting it in the cold weather it takes an hour before the screen comes back.  
All of that is moot, because now after only 2 weeks of operation it only works indoors, though it is a mere 45 degrees outside.
Sent it back

I like everything about the thermometer except its most important feature: the outside temperature is too strongly influenced by the inside temperature.  

Ok, so I have it installed at my place in the mountains where the difference at night on the inside/outside termperatures can be forty degrees or more.  Many mornings I check this thermometer with two other outside thermometers and find the other two may read, for example, 15 degrees and this one will read 35 degrees.  It will be 60 degrees inside. 

My window is double-paned, but that still does not insulate sufficiently to produce unreliable outside readings.  

When not window-mounted and placed by other thermometers, the readings are acceptable and consistent

This basket is NOT stainless steel as advertised.  It is merely chrome plated.  I returned it immediately and have been dinged for return shipping costs and other miscellaneous fees as the 'error was not our fault'.  Amazon is continuing to advertise this item as something it is not despite being alerted to the discrepancy by other consumers.  I believe that qualifies this error as being entirely their fault.  This is not the level of customer service I have come to expect and rely upon in my dealings with Amazon

I also ordered this based on the description of "stainless steel" and was disappointed to receive a chrome-plated product. Worse yet, it doesn't even fit the Char-Broil Universal Rotisserie attachment I have for my grill.

The installation instructions require you to tighten the fitting to the point that you break the little black intstallation tool.  Once the tank is empty it can not be refilled unless the station has an adapter.  I have not found a station with one yet.  You can not get the adapter off the tank with out the tool you broke.  They dont sell the black tool and it's designed so nothing else fits.  You have to purchase the whole fitting just to get the tool.  Another $17.00 down the drain. After my third one, I finally fabbed a tool out of a bolt head by grinding the head into the right shaped triangle.

Well, the Hansen Gas-Mate II Quick Disconnect Adapter will temporarily solve your BBQ connection issues, but ONLY TEMPORARILY.  What will inevitably happen to you will be suffering my fate.  Upon emptying your tank, you are going to find someday that you will have this adapter stuck in the threads of the tank.  There is no place to grab the adapter with a wrench or pliers to get a good grip on it to turn it.

Save that little plastic inner piece that comes with it as you can get an adjustable wrench around the square outside of that to turn the adapter out for a while, until the day comes when the torque required is too much for the plastic inner piece.  I would also recommend greasing up both sets of threads, the ones on the new tank and the ones on the Hansen Gas-Mate II adapter.  AND DON'T OVERTIGHTEN IT putting it into your new full tank.

This adapter is another bad design by Weber.  This adapter should come with either a strong metal inner piece that helps you remove it, or it should have some portion of the adapter itself on its outside that operates like a nut and serves as a grabbing point for a wrench

This grill cover is pretty much as generic as you can imagine.  Not only is the vinyl material that it is made of thin and easily tear-able, the drawstring at it's base is very easily prone to breaking.  

I have bought and had to return this product twice already.  Save yourself the trouble and look up market for something that you can depend on for a little longer than a single use

There oughta be a law. 

I can utterly guarantee that this thing won't work. I was employed in the pest control industry for 16 years. We used to find cockroaches living in such devices all the time (it's usually nice toasty warm in there). Sanitation, exclusion, and very careful application of pesticides is what you need.

Rodents are sometimes repelled for a brief time, but quickly adapt (adapting to environmental conditions is one of the things rats do best). Again, count on sanitation, exclusion, and traps; try to avoid baits because you'd rather know where the little s.o.b. died (i.e. in a trap, rather than in a wall somewhere)

Look at my other reviews for other meat tenderizers that are made a lot better than this one and would be more worth your while.  I say it's flimsy because it's so skinny.  Other ones have a wider base and offers more stability when you're stabbing into cuts of meat.  This smaller one also means you have to stab the meat a lot more.  I say just get the larger one that's more stable and takes less effort

I bought this grill basket for my husband for Father's Day.  According to the description, it had everything we were looking for: detachable handle, separate sections for separate cooking, grilled veggies won't fall through, etc.  Unfortunately, the basket is so poorly made that the baskets don't open (without a crowbar!) and the handle neither attaches or detatches without a whole lot of muscle.  My husband had to get out his tools and try to rebend the whole thing to get it to function.  What an over-priced dissappointment

The spit is a very thick steel bar that is difficult to bend. The forks and clamps to hold the food are solid with thick chrome. The motor is made in Taiwan and my first one came in dead on arrival. Read up on the other Weber Rotisseries reviewed by other customers and you will see the motor is a weak point

This metal detector is nice, notwithstanding, it performs poorly when in all metal mode.  Initially all metal mode works fine, however, after half an hour of use the batteries begin to wear out and the battery low indicator does not come on.  When all metal mode is used after half an hour of the detector's use, it just squeals uncontrollably.  It's supposed to go off over metal and pin point the source of your initial find with great accuracy.  Again, after thirty minutes of use of the detector, it will no longer go off over the source, it will just go off constantly, no mater where you hold it.  I could hold it into the air and it still squeals.  I made every adjustment I could and it just continues to make noise.  This mode is worthless unless your using it with two fresh 9 volt batteries every half an hour.  Finally, if you're hunting say meteorites for four hours, you can expect to spend over $56.00 on batteries for that afternoon

I grill year round and in many weather conditions.  Unlike the gold and platinum grills, the silver grill does not have a carry handle to keep it shut for transport (see the review about the burnt down car), nor does it have the ability to prop the lid as a wind/rain shield.  The silver grill works fine in nice weather for fast, hot cooking, but if you want to grill in a drizzle or in a little wind, the ability to prop the lid up (available on the gold and platinum models) is essential.  I lost my gold grill.  Last night I tried cooking in a little rain on the silver grill, and it wasn't up to task like my gold grill was.  I'm going to buy a gold or platinum grill this time

I spent the extra on this alarm because I wanted a projection feature.

The projection feature lasted 2 weeks.

I also had a wall clock made by LaCrosse that does not accurately reflect either the temperature or the humidity.

Save your money, folks.

Hopefully, Amazon will refund my $$

The clock works well,but is really too small,and the projection only works well in dimly lit locations. It also has to be at some optimal distance from the wall to actually see the numbers.It does not have a focus feature if you wanted to put it close to a wall

I regret this purchase. This clock has a very, very low projection beam that barely makes it to my ceiling from my bedside table. It's definitely not readable if you have diminished eyesight and aren't wearing glasses, as is the case with better models.

Even more troubling, the atomic clock part seems to set itself to random times in the middle of the night.

On the positive side, the temperature reads accurate and it's nice to have both inside and outside temps in a cheaper model

This item came to me and as much as I tried, the only way I could view the numerals on the ceiling was to see them upside down. There was no way to turn the unit so that it would project so that I could read it from my bed. I tried placing it on both sides of the bed but that didn't work either. It seemed to me, the guts of the unit were placed in wrong. And there is only one way to move the projector. So, I cannot recommend this item.  I sent it back

Yes the pot held the oil and turkey and the fire lit under the pot. It didn't fall down under it's own weight and fried my turkey. That said here are some problems. I had to make 3 trips to the hardware store so if you purchase this item and read this first, you should knock that down to ONE trip. But you will make the trip none-the-less. First off the three scews that hold the legs on are listed at 2" but are more like 1 1/4" and thus had to be replaced ( or you WON'T get the nut on the screw ). Second, and this is crucial, the main bolt that goes through the burner assembly, burner holding bar, and heat shield is made of "Made in China" crap metal. It will already be installed and is sticking out of the burner assembly. In the instructions you have to remove it's nut and washers. But when reapplying the nut and washers through the bar and heat shield, it WILL strip unless you get lucky and tighten it just right the first time. This bolt needs to be made of good steel... and it's not!  If it's tight just let it be because you will strip it if you mess with it. It is impossible to find if you need to replace it because both hardware stores I went to didn't have it and didn't know where else to find it. It is a 6mm 2 3/4" bolt. My solution to fix the stripped bolt was to add 3 washers before screwing on the nut and thus catching on some fresh unstripped thread. Luckily there was enough bolt showing. Had that not worked this thing would have been junk just 1 day before Thanksgiving and I'd have been rushing off to buy a differant one.
Just look over your parts before assembling this thing and make sure those bolts are as long as they're supposed to be and if not make that one trip to the store for bolts and washers too. I guess whatever model/brand you get will be made in China too (isn't everthing?) so I don't want to recommend another, besides I've only owned this one. Make sure you follow ALL precautions about using this thing to the letter. I would also add that even a little wind will slow down or stop your cooking time as the burner blasts out the gas so fast (which is normal for that hot a flame needed) that the fire is only on the tips of the gas so find a relatively wind free place, errect/effect/find a windblocker/lean-to but DEFINATELY outside and away from structures or anything that can fall and knock over your pot. Gobble Gobble!
By the way the turkey was soooo good that everyone raved about it and wanted to take (did take) it all home. Look around for tips on preparing, injecting and rubbing the bird. I kept the temp at 350 (initially at 375 but after you SLOWLY... slowly dip in the bird the temp will go down) and then maintain 350 from there out. Get a bird at 15lbs or under (or the pot will fill too high)  and cook for 3 1/2 min. per pound. Look for more tips online. That bird was tastey

I purchased 8 of the AA batteries because of the low price of 4.99 for 4.

The fine print on the battery indicates 1900 milliamps plus or minus 10 percent, so the range would be 1710 to 2090 milliamps. After many days of "refreshing" the battery in my La Crosse BC-900 charger I ended up with the following: 

1634 Milli amps
1795
1701 
2001
1769
1781
1754
1549

So two of the cells are below spec.

Earlier I had purchase some 2700 milliamp batteries from Sanyo, on Amazon, for about 12.99 per four. All of them were within spec.

I'm glad I didn't pay a penny more than 4.99 for four.

Of 12 batteries I purchased, 2 of them were leaking in the box. I would rate these higher except that I also purchased 20 AAAs and 12 of them were leaky. I imagine I was just lucky that only 2 of this size leaked. Take the fact that most of these batteries will be bad when you compare prices. I paid $4.99/4-pack which is a good price as long as more than half of them survive (whick may not be very likely)

I had an "EZ-UP" 10x10' shelter in my back yard, and when one crossbar broke, it broke 2 others. If anyone had been sitting in the chair in my back yard, they'd have become a shishcabob from the cheap thin metal used to make these canopies. Although EZ-UP sells products on their web site to facilitate holding these canopies down in the wind, they do NOT cover ANY "wind or rain damage," and although this, in my view, was NOT a factor of why the frame failed, the company's first response when I called to get a return authorization after it failed only after about 8 months of use, they quickly stated "we don't cover wind or rain damage, cut me off, and had apparently NO reguard for anyone's safety, stating that if it was raining or even in the slightest wind (I think it failed in around 2 mph "winds"), their "warantee" did not cover it! They said I could send it in and THEY would determine (after paying an outrageous sum of money to send it back) IF they might replace it, but that they likely would not. The people at the company were rude, had NO concern that their product had some safety issues, and so I'm looking to buy something less expensive, and that lasts longer! INteresting, they told me that they don't cover ANY wond or rain "damage", yet they also sell hold-downs & it states on their web site (& apparently in directions that I never received with mine) NOT to fold it up if it was wet, but to leave it up!

I had a MUCH less expensive shade that latested MUCH longer and I'd recommend others to do the same, or to buy an industrial model that CLEARLY stated in their warantee that the product can withstand wind up to "x" mph & that it is made to withstand rain as well. 

After my experience with this company's product, and their staff in the returns dept., I would avoid ever buying one of these again! I received mine as a gift (that cost my friend over $200!)

There are MUCH better, sturdier, and safer canopies out there. 

If I could give this product a zero or negative score, I would!

These canopies are NOT NEARLY as sturdy as I recall them being years ago (or perhaps that was another brand?) 

I expect these canopies will be recalled in time due to safety issues.

I would STRONGLY recommend buying something less expensive and sturdier

  The grill is up to Webers usual high standards but I do have a couple of quibbles with it.  I bought the Q grill because I needed a high quality but smaller and lighter unit for use in my rv.  Since every pound counts, the solid cast iron grill will probably not travel.  But an even bigger problem was the lack of a non stick surface.  I don't have the time nor inclination to "season" a cast iron grill.  What I would have liked is a high quality aluminum grill with a non stick surface

a year ago we bought a performance series and was very happy with it until a week ago when upon lighting it the fire spread out of the pit area and melted the controls.  Char broil was unconcerned and indicated that did not sell replacement parts.  No comments whatsoever on the safety.  It seems that replaceing the grill on a yearly basis is expected at Charbroil.  In the past we have used Weber and got ten years from the grill.  I would look at the Weber

This seemed like a wonderful grill, but the regulator (which keeps gas from leaking) failed after about a month.  Unlike other grills, the Charbroil regulator has to be purchased as part of the full burner assembly (over $100, while other grill manufacturers sell just the regulator and tube, for about $20).  The regulator's not covered by their warranty, either.  Customer support has been terrible, with "communication" only coming through Charbroil's FAQ's on the Web.  Fortunately, there are enough other Charbroil owners with similar problems who have written on the Web about this problem.  I will never buy a Charbroil product again.  This has all been so terribly disappointing, because I've wanted to support a good U.S. company -- but Charbroil's engineering and customer support is reminding me of the big three automakers in the 1980s.

Without trying to sound overly negative this is subpar engineering and production at its finest.  First, I was expecting something that would assemble "in minutes"... guess when you dont qualify how many that years are also broken into "minutes".. this unit has roughly 60 individual pieces that require assembly not including nuts and bolts.  Finish was VERY poorly applied and rust was already visible on the carbon steel on the underside of the side burner.  Guage of steel for the cart assembly is subpar.  Amazon has been very good to deal with and is refunding my puchase and returning the grill.  There are many better systems available out there than this.  Very disappointing merchandise and misleading advertising on the manufacturers end.  I made the mistake of buying prior to any of these units being available locally because I thought I was getting a good deal

I purchased this product in May 2006. However, it is not working this year April 2007. I replaced the 40 watt bulb, but it still does not work. This is not a product worth the expense. I would say that for less that 11 months of use $8.00 would be a high enough price to pay

I recently bought the Stinger UV15. It worked well for one month! In that month I followed the recommendations for cleaning it and keeping it clear of dead bugs. Well just shy one month and the grid has completely failed so it attracts the bugs, but doesn't kill them. This product is not worth the money

I purchased a 40 wt Stinger Insect Killer from Home Depot last year and the bulb started shorting out after 3 months. Since it was near the end of the season I decided to store it and replace the bulb when I put it out in the spring. The bulb was replaced but would only work intermitently. Insects also clogged it after a couple of days. I gave up on it and recently  purchased a Flowtron BK 40 and it works great Don't waste your money, buy a Flowtron instead (my last Flowtron lasted over 20 years with the same bulb).

I have bought and returned 1/2 and 1 acre Stinger bug zappers from Costco 4 times now in the past 3 years. Thank God I was buying from Costco as Stinger products are worthless. Light attracts them but zappers don't work. Some worked for a week and others didn't zap at all. I don't know why Costco carries such a terrible product. I kept thinking, maybe these were a bad batch and I will finally get a good product. Not so, do not buy these products

I purchased one and it lasted about 3 months; light still worked but did not kill any bugs attracted to it.  Stinger replaced it under warranty-this time it lasted one month-same problem.  Stinger replaced it again under warranty and the third one lasted 1 1/2 months, again same problem.  
Will not go to the trouble to get it replaced again-will buy a Flowtron which I had used 5 or 6 years ago and which lasted for 2-3 years.

On my second one now...Not that I liked it much the first time, just that it is the only brand they sell in the local store here.  I will say that while it worked, it worked...I mean, it killed some bugs!  These, however, are my problems with it:  Bulbs burn out fast!  Like after four to six months...And the replacement bulbs are almost as much as I paid for the whole unit!  The thing gets jammed up with bugs and there is no easy way to clean it.  Finally, it doesn't appear to be very weatherproof.  The first one died after a storm and the one I have now has just died.  I think I am buying a different brand on here...One that works for more than a few months

I bought one of the custom tile #7's (loaded with options) from California and was able to use it for less than a year before it started to self-destruct. I tried to get it replaced under warranty for two more years, until they skipped to Mexico. Tiles just didn't fall off, they spalted. The fire box broke, etc. When it got too bad to use and look at, we had to throw it away . . . a $1500 mistake.

If there was a really good ceramic cooker out there, I would try it again. They cook like a dream

I am the owner of a kamado, purchased in August of 2000 when the company wan located in Sacramento, CA. After owning the unit for less than two years, I started to develop cracks in the interior of the kamado. the company would not replace or honor the life time warranty on the unit. Since that time the tiles have come loose in sheets and I have a defective unit that is unsightly and not what I purchased with the supposed lifetime warranty. All calls and emails to the company would not resolve the defects in materials and workmanship. The company's answer is to glue the tiles back on the unit. This is not acceptable for a unit of this cost. Check and see if you unit is made from ceramic materials or from Portland cement as in the case of mine. unless kamado has changed their manufacturing process in Ensenada, Mexico the units are made of Portland cement. This material will not last and carries no lifetime warranty. I am sorry to give them one star, they don't have a negative star number. check out this company with San Diego BBB and Sacramento BBB and read before you buy. There are various website that deal with the
fraud of the kamado group. Their website does not allow any truthful posts. The truthful posts are removed almost immediately.
As they say on eBay, BUYER BEWARE, FRAUD, AND NOT WHAT THEY REPRESENT.
There are true ceramic cookers out there for sale, that are truly ceramic and not ceramic coated tiles in grout.

I have one other Weather Station from La Crosse that seems to work ok, but this thing is a paperweight as far as I am concerned. It shows that it is raining out when the sun is out! It constantly losses contact with the remote sensor and the temp and humidity seems to always be off. I have attempted to contact La Crosse, but as other reviewers have said, that is a lost cause. They never answer any emails regarding product help or issues, and no one seems to answer their phone either. Maybe I have a lemon, but I feel for what they charge for their products, La Crosse should be more responsive to their customers

I am extreamly disappointed with this product. The icons do not give an indication of the type of weather you can expect. Instead, they provide an indication if the weather is getting worse or better. The fluff on the out side of the box states: "Forecast Icon Based on Changing Barometric Pressure." The way I read that is the Icons will provide a forecast, but they do not.  I do not understand why you would have a rain Icon, a cloudy icon, a partly cloudy icon and a sunny icon if they are not a forecast. I was so surprised at reading this in the manual, I called La Crosses tech support. Tech support confirmed what I read was accurate. As stated, in on of the other reviews, the station is difficult to read when it is stand mounted. You will have to bendover or be in a seated position in order to see things clearly. Adjusting the contrast does not help. Wall mounting might be a better option. The buttons, as stated in another review, feel mushy when pushed. The outdoor sensor is not compleatly weather proof so you will need to mount it where it will not get wet from rain or snow. A potentially great product that is poorly executed.

The clock was off by -4 hours even after so called rebooting. I called tech support and they requested me to send the clock back to them at my cost so that they can pop the hands off and advance it four hours. They should have replaced it for free but they did not. I just think this clock is just a big hoax

I have owned the WMR-968 for several years now and have spent more on 'replacement' parts than if I had bought an entire new unit.  Primarily, the solar transmitter on the rain gauge continually fails to bring the charge up to enough power for the transmitter to transmit back to the base.  I have replaced this transmitter unit three times (twice with the 'new' style).  Living in the Phoenix area, we don't run into too many cloudy or rainy days, but as soon as it doesn't get sunlight for any length of time, the display reads all dashes (not receiving a signal).  So when it rains here, I usually don't get a reading of how much because this thing stops working.  The anemometer is mounted on the same pole just above the rain gauge with the both of the solar transmitters also mounted on the same pole.  The anemometer works consistently and fine.  Both OS and the local distributor say the distance is too far, the unit must have gone bad and needs replacement, etc.,etc.  Replacing the solar unit didn't help and the distance can't be too far for one unit and not the other.  No one can help with this issue.  So my suggestion would be to spend the extra bucks and get something more reliable.

One star is the lowest rating I can give this system and it's frankly not worth even that. Problems start with the design. You have to take out eight tiny little screws to insert the backup batteries or plug in a sensor cable into the nifty looking "solar powered" sender unit, which has to be placed somewhere in full sunlight for it to function at all. Once you've mounted the unit on your roof, you have to remove those pesky little screws on the roof, in the freezing wind usually, several times a winter. Or wait for Spring and nice weather when you don't need to know if you can expect black ice on your early morning drive to work. 
Sometimes resetting the base station works (which you have to place inconveniently so that the unit has direct line of sight communication. Usually not. OS Sales has it advertised at 300 feet, but actually something less than forty if your batteries are more than a day old (see battery change procedure above). By the way, there is a backup nicad battery in the unit, supposedly kept charged by the impressive solar power collector. This will fail because it rapidly loses capacity due to a poor discharge recharge cycle. If any of these three fail, the unit won't function. 
Strangely enough, my rain gauge (I live in the desert) has continued to function for over a year with little attention. However, the temp/humidity sensor which I would like to refer to most often, is what fails every night. I'd like to replace the Nicad battery, but can't find one anywhere. 
Ahem. Customer Service and the lack of it. I don't know how many emails I've sent. Or calls I've placed. Or time I've spent listening to the backside of the Oregon Scientific hold button. Their website only lists complete systems in the replacement parts category. While assumptions can be dangerous, my only option seems to be to scrap $300 worth of two-year old hardware and buy more, and more, and more. 
This was a well-intended gift. I'm trying to make it work. but it doesn't, usually when I need it most.

I bought the WMR968 2/10/2005 and as of today,2/14/2007, only the indoor Baro-Therm-hygro still works. The Anemometer was replaced under warrenty 11/2005. This service took 2 months to complete with Oregon Sci. The anemometer then quit 12/2006 and Oregon Sci. said tough luck it's out of warranty. The Thermo-Hygro quit 2/2007 and once again, tough luck.

 My thoughts on the unit besides it not functioning after 2 years: Cheap and cheaper. The manual is nearly worthless. The anemometer is accurate to about 60 Kts. then gets wildly optimistic. The temp.,humidity, baro seem accurate. The rain gauge is kinda funky the way it reports because of a delay built in and the resolution but it is useable. All of the failures I have had I think are related to water intrusion into the sending units. Everone has had green corrosion on the PC boards when taken down from the rooftop. The sealing of the units is very poor and the use of phone cords is very cheap. 

 I just got off the phone, again, with Oregon Sci. and Juan from customer Service told me "we can't help you". 

 If you want a weather station that is made cheaply, has no customer support and will last less then 2 years buy a WMR968. I guess for the price compared to professional weather stations this thing will attarct a lot of people but buyer beware

We have had this weather station for a year now an more times then not there are absolutely no readings!  I only get an indoor reading, which I could get from my thermostat!  We have reset it, messed with the sensors, moved it around the house in many locations with a direct site on the outdoor sensors and still no readings.  Its very frusterating when its a hurricane outside and you can't get any wind readings.  This junk cost me a couple of hundred dollars and was a very dissapointing birthday present for my husband!  Also I called customer service and was on hold for over a hour and still never got a human to talk to for help!  Don't buy this product!!

The spring on these tongs broke on first use, in September, 2006.  This renders them largely useless. I purchased the tongs after reading manufacturer assurances dated many months ago that the spring problem had been repaired.  Despite this assurance, I am here to tell you that a pair shipped recently is still defective.  I returned them, and I cannot recommend these tongs

We took a chance on these for part of a Father's Day gift and the piece of metal that acts as a spring broke after only 1 use. After reading the reviews I called the company instead of returning for a refund. They were very nice and sent out another one. This one just broke - exactly like the other one - after about a month of use. The overall design of the tongs is great like other Raichlen products but the construction is severely lacking. Don't waste your money on this model.

I spent several months and 5 purchases trying to find a good set of tongs for my husband who is the pickiest "BBQ Expert"...These were one of the WORST. DO NOT BUY THEM. The locking mechanism is clunky. They do not open and close smoothly. The OXO 16 inch Tongs are much better and lighter. You do want tongs that have a hinge vs the ones that are permanently open waiting for you to squeeze them around what you are trying to pick up. Good luck. I had to send these back

I bought this unit becuase it says it measures 11'8" square.  Well it actually measures 9'8" square.  So, now I have to take it down box it up and start again

I bought this clock expecting it to: show the humidity in a room; show the temperature; and to set itself for daylight savings.

It does neither of the above. The temperature stays at 60 and the humidity measure it always WAY off. In the same room I have an alarm clock that does all of the above accurately. 

The clock is attractive and easy to read and it keeps time ok. But it should do more. 

I am very disappointed

I purchased this particular clock because it was described as an "Outdoor" clock.  Upon receipt of the clock I read the instruction book and under the section entitled "Frequently Asked Questions" is the following: 
"Q. Can a La Cross Technology clock be used outdoors?  
 A. Yes, but only in a dry environment and in a temperature range between 41 F andd 131 F.  This clock is NOT water-resistant."  
Living in New England, we do get rain and snow and the temperature is frequently below 41 F.  The clock has a VERY misleading description

I bought this product no long ago.  It never works.  Mice still jump around, and even make noise.  I call the company.  They don't have technical report.  The product manual says, once mice get used to the ultrasound, it will not work.  I never heard about this from other company.  This company is very bad.

Okay here is my indepth review. 

I have little flies of some sort in my Hydroponic vegie greenhouse. I bought this seemingly easy little hunk of plastic to make a sound that's only bothersome little animalsand bugs hear. 

4 days after purchase the little guys seem to be flying to the ultrasound. The jig and bop back and forth like they are dancing....I bet they are dancing, making love and reproducing to the Ultrasonic waves! 

I killed more bugs inhaling while plugging this in my Green house. 

Rather then take it back I suggest you huck it at a Black & Decker Exec as the are robbing us telling us this thing works. On the box they site a study but don't show it's reference. When I called BD they said, "We don't know what study that info came from". They are hornswaggling us! This is gonna be big like Enron! Corporate Karma! 

Update- 7 days later. I really wanted to give this product a chance as I'm lazy beyond belief and plugging stuff in is right up my alley. If I have to go buy Lady bugs or pest spray I'm gonna be pissed. 
SOOOOOooooooo I bought 4 more and plugged them all in for 3 more days in my small greenhouse...... not a damn thing happened. Actually I think it works like a rave and extascy for the flies. There are more of them now and they seem to be having much more fun!

So in conclusion, This thing sucks more then the suckiest thing that ever sucked a suck. Only buy it if you need some extra plastic hanging from your outlets.

I bought this unit and used it one time in a smoker and everything worked perfectly. The next time I went to use it I found that the probe had failed. Replaced batteries and then checked probe with an ohmmeter and found it was open circuit. So it cost me $20 to cook one meal. My advice is to look elsewhere if you need a digital thermometer

I purchased two cushions to use on small chairs.  When the cushions I arrived, I could hardly believe how small they were, smaller than the description stated.  In addition to the small size, the cushions had a lot of stuffing and seemed more like volleyballs than chair cushions.

The name on this item should be "pillow". It is much too small for a cushion. They need to change the discription to pillow or cushion for your head. I wish I had spent more time reading the whole page on this item before I ordered it. Lesson learned

These outdoor window thermometers SEEMED like a good idea,  however, they're worthless!  The LCD display is NOT bright like shown in the picture.  The numbers are so light they are totally unreadable.  Also, the suction cups will NOT stay stuck to a cold window.  I'm returning them

Not the manufacturer's fault, I blame U.S. Congress for this....

The clock has an internal chip which did not recognize the earlier DST change this year.  There was going to be such a long delay before being able to get a replacement chip and/or clock that we just returned the clocks.  Disappointed

I was more or less forced to buy this product because I had very precise size requirements and this product fitted them.  I was very disappointed by the quality of the product for the cost.  It comes in about 19 different pieces, all of which are a hollow plastic polymer.  It is fairly lightweight, which could be good or bad depending on what you plan to do with it.  At the $200+ price, you'd think they would include a shelf, but they only give you a stencil to make it yourself out of 'shelving material'.

My biggest complaint was that I was missing four of the pieces and had other extra pieces when I received it.  I got bounced back and forth between Amazon and Suncast's customer service before I got the right people at Suncast to send me replacement parts (which took over a week to arrive).  On top of that, they didn't even send me the right replacement parts!  After another phone call and explanation, more parts were sent.  If I keep the extras I have, and make a couple more calls, I may have enought for a second shed.  Ugh.

Directions are ok, but they'll make you scratch your head as you look through all the similiar looking parts. Especially when they don't send you the right pieces

This product was purchased as a Christmas gift and unfortunately did not work as advertised.  The projection light only was operational when touched - perhaps this was defective.  I have returned the product for a refund and am awaiting the refund.

The unit is supposed to have a projection LED. The manual states that "When the unit is plugged into AC outlet, the projection alarm will continuously project the time."  This does not happen. What good is the projection when in the middle of the night you have to find the clock, find the right button and read the time befor the light goes out?  How do you trust a company like this

I bought this thing to solve a problem and I have a new  one, I red the little manual, trying to figure out how to have a projection and no way. It does not stay in projection mode, if you want to see the light projection you have to press the button. I change the battery, I left the clock for 26 minute before to change the paramenters  and no way. I wil buy one more expensive but one that work the projection. Of course I do not recogmend it.

The product promises good results, but the instruction manual is very unfriendly and confusing -- and printed in such small fonts that one needs a magnifying glass to read it and a third hand to execute the steps that are indicated.  Unfortunately, as an average customer, I have only two hands.
After several attempts, I still have not been able to make the display light up permanently onto the ceiling.
I look forward to resolving that, but the problem is that you need a combination of obscurity in the room to view the display on the ceiling, but light on the instruction manual to read it

I bought a new grill and wanted to make sure it was used properly. I don't like it when small pieces of food fall through, especially on gas grills, so I bought this. Well, on first use it stained so bad, despite my priming it, and worse, it warped. Hey, I can still use it. But it's kinda like wearing soiled clothes... won't feel as good

All of the above reviews are correct.  They are nice looking and moderately functional.  I may pour some concrete to overcome some of the functional problems it has.  The stake needs to go deeper into the ground to keep it from coming out.  At $10.99 however, it was a great bargain, and a 4 star rating.  At it's current winter sale price of $16.99 however, it is a 1 star rating.  I'll average them weighting it's current price and give it 2 stars.

The turning weel is too small so the hose often falls off. The stake is round and too short, it won't stay in ground. Pretty much useless

They were on sale, and I ordered 2. They arrived separately in two HUGE boxes - via UPS - and looked like they had both been dropped from about 10 stories up. Sigh... The mats themselves had broken and cracked rubber backing. I guess they got beaten up in transit. The actual pattern in the mats is beautiful and the fiber is nice and dense. So - I kept them. They are outside and hopefully they won't fall apart too quickly.

If you are really picky, you better take a good look at these when they are delivered

I bought this in January and it worked beautifully until daylight savings time came around.  Now it is an hour off (one hour less than it should be) and won't reset to daylight savings time.  There is a button that resets it if you don't have daylight savings time but it dosent do anything either. Removed and reinserted the battery following instructions endlessly but it is stuck an hour short until the fall.   No reply from the manufacturer.  Beautiful clock but useless half the year

This clock includes a chip that was designed to change the time.  When the new daylight savings time was effective the clock would not reset to the new time.  Interestingly the manufacturer has not removed the clocks from inventory or attempted to inform buyers of the issue as of yet. Other than that it is a beautifull clock

I don't own this clock, but I do own one of it's sister clocks, the Tambour Style Mantel Clock, and it did not change for DST now that the date has changed.  Even though I've owned my clock for all of a month and a half, River City Cuckoo Clocks does not consider this fact to be a defect.  Since I would assume that all their radio controlled clocks have the same electronics, I would be very wary about buying this clock

The product was, as advertised, easy to install and has worked continuously for more than two months since I installed it.  So far, it does not appear to have affected the mole population, however. To be fair, it is possible that my sandy soil is not the ideal medium for this device (instructions indicate that it works best in heavy claylike soil, although the critters have dug quite close to it).  To be really bend-over-backwards fair, I suppose it is possible that my problem is not moles, although the telltale signs are exactly what I understand mole tunnels to look like.

Warning to all potential buyers!  This product is a total farce.  I bought four of these and placed them way closer than the required maximum distance.  And yes I put brand new Duracells in these things.  The moles actually burrowed right next to thems.  Save your money and buy the old fashioned traps that actually kill the moles.  These things don't work

I read the mixed reviews on this site before purchasing, so it's my own fault for still going ahead and purchasing!  I was hopeful the product would work for me.

I've tried 3 of these in different locations in my yard, all with the same result:  mounds of dirt leading right up to the Molechaser!  They seem attracted to it, not turned off by it.  I only wish I could upload a photo of the dirt mounds that literally are less than an inch away from each device!

This product has done nothing to discourage moles, voles, etc.  In all three locations, the lawn damage continues.

Don't make the same mistake I did.  Look for another solution rather than this product

Don't waste your money.  I bought two of these.  A few weeks later several moles tunneled within 10 feet of the one in the same places as last year.  I put one in my gardern - a few weeks later a mole tunneled right alongside the molechaser as if to see what it was to his delight!  Total waste of money like everthing else I've tried except Nash loop traps

You have heard the old expression that if it sounds too good to be true it probably is?  This product is proof of that.  I really wanted to avoid poison and traps so I thought I would try this P.O.S. to solve my gopher problem humanely.  Sure I was skeptical, but some buyers reported success.  After 4 weeks, I can report that my gophers are utterly and completely indifferent to this product.  I noticed some buyers experienced a surge in activity, but I have seen nothing.  Nada.  Zip.    Numerous fat happy gophers before, numerous fat happy gophers after.

Sorry to say it, as I've liked Oregon Scientific products in the past, but this is a junker.  Two chief problems.  First is that it doesn't know how to switch over to daylight savings time correctly.  I understand that the switch-over dates were changed this year, but this is the more recent model clock, and the older RM826A has no trouble this year.  I got up an hour late on that first daylight savings time Sunday in March.  Sadly, even if you manually set the RM323A to the correct time, it will reset overnight to the wrong time.  The only way to fix this (per Oregon Scientific's web site) is to turn off the radio connection to the atomic clock, thereby defeating the reason for owning this clock in the first place.  (In fairness, O-S says that it will work fine after April 1, but what about future years when the dates change around?  My guess is same problem.)  The second problem is that it's very difficult to use, including such basic stuff as setting an alarm.  Granted, Oregon Scientific clocks don't have a lot of buttons, so it has to be a little complicated to handle all of the functions.  But this particular clock has both a "single alarm" and a "weekly alarm" that goes off every day at the same time, and selecting which one, setting the alarm time, and even just turning on and off the alarm is anything but obvious.

I suppose the world time capability could be useful for some folks, but I find this clock worse in every respect than the RM826A, which is no longer manufactured.  I'm going to toss this one in the trash and find a couple of RM826A's before they're no longer available.  Oregon Scientific has no more in stock as of a couple of days ago

Warmth from window affects thermometer! D'oh! It's totally inaccurate on single-pane glazing, very inaccurate on dual-pane glazing, and still slightly inaccurate when mounted on a jerri-rigged 6" extender from dual-pane glass. The nature of windows being a big source of heat loss means this thermometer is measuring *warm* ambient air, not actual outside temperature

The major problem with this device is its placement location in proximity to the indoors, e.g., on a window.  The indoor temp seems to affect the outdoor temp reading by anywhere from 3 to 7 degrees.  Would be better if it had a wire probe that extended further from the device.  Returned item.  Don't waste your money

I bought this weather station along with two remote sensors. After about two days I was skeptical about the inside humidity (reading 4%). To test the accuracy, I placed the remote sensors side-by-side with this unit. The temp seems to all be in sync, but I get different humidity readings on all three...this morning was 4% 27% and 31%. I have no idea which one is correct. I'm going to return this product

Just received this item purchased on 11/21, Unfortunately at that time there were no reviews on it.
Again as previous reviews state:
Item is not a Professional Outdoor Cooker as listed Still, but a Commercial Grade Cooker; this printed right on the box.
Features have now been changed, Orginally stated included with an aluminum basket and fish fry pot & basket. I received the items as listed now. All in All it does appear to be a nice cooker, but I bought it for the versitiliy of the features listed previously. Contacting Customer Service on this Misleading Advertisement.

As was the case with the previous reviewer, I did not receive the item that was described.  It is not a Professional Outdoor Cooker but a Commercial grade cooker.  In addition, there are no baskets included.  This set-up might be fine for frying a turkey but would not work for frying fish without additional equipment.  What you'll get is what is shown in the picture - not what is described

I ORDERED TWO OF THESE SETS AND WAS NOT SENT WHAT IS DESCRIBED.
THERE IS NO LARGE ALUMINUM BASKET AND NO FISH FRY BASKET INCLUDED.  THE DESCRIPTION SAYS IT IS PROFESSIONAL GRADE, BUT I RECEIVED COMMERCIAL GRADE.  CUSTOMER SERVICE HAS OFFERED TO SEND ME OUT A REPLACEMENT, BUT I AM ASSUMING THE SAME THING WILL HAPPEN AGAIN.  IT SEEMS AS IF AMAZON ATTACHED THE WRONG PICTURE AND DESCRIPTION TO THIS ITEM. BEWARE IF YOU WANT EVERYTHING THAT IS LISTED, THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU WILL GET

There is a reason this mitt is relatively cheap. The shape of it is very strange. It does not fit my hands at all. I have fairly wide hands and this mitt feels very ackward. It is tight to get into and the thumb is too short. I would return it except the postage would cost me more than the mitt did. I would suggest you buy in person someplace where you can put your hands in it first.

I found the mitt to be too stiff to be of any real use.  You can't really pick up or handle any utensils with the mit on.  You can move hot plates, etc. but you can't really carry anything with the mitt on.  Not worth the money albeit not very expensive.

These mitts are good quality. Problem is that the thumbs are way to short and narrow rendering these mitts virtually useless. Do yourself a favor and go to a store where you can try stuff like this before you buy.

While the mitt is beautiful and the price is right, it is narrow.  Most mitts flare towards the opening, this one does not.  I have larger forearms and it won't fit all the way up.  My husband has average sized arms and it won't go around his upper forearm either.  Since they are so long they go almost to your elbow

A pretty simple device. Not really a waterfall concept of any kind. The water just plops into the first cup until it overflows into the next etc. Nothing runs down the chain. I suppose you could try to direct the water but it usually depends on the flow. It's mostly an asthetic piece

I tried it as recommended for over 4 weeks and then some, I did 
not see any reduction in the number of mosquitoes, actually there
seemed to be more in the same area where the unit was installed. 
I did try different locations. 

Perhaps they are attracted to it, but they are not being sucked in.

Looking at the tray, it did kill a bunch of other harmless flying insects

The Rion Mini Lean-To greenhouse comes in a flimsy cardboard box that contains about a hundred plastic parts. It difficult to put together because the parts are poorly labeled. (Making it even more difficult for me was that several parts were missing.) The 12 page instruction manual shows several diagrams - but no photos - with parts labelled to help with assembly. One classic exerpt on page 7, "The 'OUT' on the 2D connector should face the inside of the Mini Lean-To". This kind of product gives the term "some assembly required" a bad name. 

Also, it's a bit pricely to be so flimsy and poorly designed. Save yourself the trouble get something else.

Like other reviewers, initially I was impressed with these very stylish and comfortable chairs. However, after 1 year outside (in Colorado) the rubber on the arms was all cracked and peeling, and the cords were frayed. The overall appearance was of a much older chair. Of course, it happened to be my mother-in-law who sat in one of the chairs when it gave way. A second chair's cord gave way shortly afterwards.

What a joke, not worth the money. I put it in the container to pull out the oil and it dies half way through. Swapped batteries, pulled it out, washed it and looked at all the parts. It was either used and resold to me by amazon, or it was defective from the start. And since they have a 30 day return policy, I am now stuck with it, I will see what eastman says next. VERY disappointing, I will go back to the old way of just pouring it into a funnel with a coffee filter in it

The picture of this curtain makes it look thicker than it really is (by a long shot).  It does not "screen out unwanted pests, birds and harsh sunlight". Well, maybe birds, but certainly not bugs or light. There are large gaps between each strand of beads and it's completely see through.  This is not what you are looking for if you want a little privacy.

On a positive note, Amazon made the return very easy

The following quote direct from Oregon Scientific is WRONG:
"And the illuminated blue back-light means you never have to fumble around in the dark, the LCD automatically adjust to the light in the room, so you can read it when you need to."
We keep our clock accross from our bed, and the LED was not readable, and from there we couldn't reach it to press the Light button (which only lasts 8 seconds).  I took it into a completely dark closet and the LED did not light up at all; the clock could not be read without pushing the Light button. Apparently there is no way to keep the backlight on.  Unless you intend to keep this clock within reach so you can press the button to turn on the light (which only lasts 8 seconds), and you don't mind not being able to see the LED from across a room, this might not be a good choice.  I returned mine due to the above deceptive product description.  Regarding the projection: the Temp reading is larger than the Time (which doesn't make sense), and the image is only a few inches tall within readable focus; also, it doesn't show up clearly on textured walls

Very poor construction to the point where i had to return it to the manufacturer.
Pre-assembled bench seat had been over tightened so that metal screws were portruding through wood into seating area.
Aesthetically unappealing because of the diverse colors of the wood.
Definately would not reccomend this product.

The item in this picture is not the item I received.  When you buy from a picture, make sure you are prepared to be disappointed.  The frame of the stand is very thin, not wide as shown, screws are seen that attach to the stand, the bottom of the bowl is seen also.  The bowl has concrete as filler, with a complete circle of bowl, looks cheap.  The colors are washed out, the bird and flower also, not vibrant as shown.  This item came with nothing from Mfg., no instuctions on anything or who they are.  It was well wrapped and the package was ruined in removing. Apparently this was planned.  I was told I could send it back free of charge.  What am I going to send it in?  Good old Amazon offered me 20% off to keep it, this is apparently their standard screw-up fee {not my first experience}.  The item I received is not an $80 item, or a $64 item, it is in my yard, it will remind me where not to buy things in the future.  BEWARE!!!!

I purchased this in January and finally got a chance to use it for Easter.  It never registered a reading from the meat I was cooking.  Now I'm stuck with an expensive timer.  If you're thinking of purchasing this wireless thermometer, think twice

I don't think this product works - I installed 2 of them and my rooms are not that big. I saw a mouse even after that. I think I will have to engage professional pest control. If you are buying to control rodents don't bother to waste yr money

These devices, tested by the FDA decades ago (including the ones with variable and intermittent pitches) do not work.  There have been a number of class-action lawsuits against the companies that sell these.  They simply don't, and can't, work against insects or rodents. It's science

This was the worst purchase I've ever made in my crusade against the ants and spiders that have taken over my home!  I have MORE pests now than I did before.  Actually had ants crawling on one of the repeller units.  If you're thinking about buying this product... DON'T waste your money.  You'd be better off with a couple of cans of Raid

Absolutely useless.  The three gizmos are in three small adjoining areas -  Kitchen / Breakfast / Office areas.  The roaches come out at night and do a little dance to the "clicks" that the gizmos emit.  No effect whatsoever after 3 months

Very disappointed.  Purchased 6 of these for an 1100 sq. foot apartment to eliminate the common spider and occasional ants and insects that appear in the Spring and Summer time.  Well, I think these units INVITE the ants in.  We've never had more ants than we do now despite following directions to place these units on opposite walls in the same room, etc.  These devices do not phase them at all - they continue to parade right by

We need a little more information.  The chair LOOKS great!  But what kind of material is it constructed from?  How big is it?  A side view would be helpful also to see how the back curves.  The price is good, now if I just knew a little more..

Okay, I am no Master Gardener, but then, this is not a product for a Master Gardener. I am also not wanted for botanicidal rampages. I bought this right after it first came on the market, did everything according to the instructions, found the perfect spot, etcetera, etcetera. About ten percent, if that, of the seeds sprouted, turned into little green shoots . . . and died. This herb garden is marketed as simple, follow-the-steps, sit-back-and-watch-it-grow. Not in my Universe! The only thing I admire about Chia Pet, Incorporated (or whatever the parent company might be named) is their skill at marketing. Each holiday season, as their commercials flourish, I am tempted. Then, I recall the Great Disaster of 1999, and I resist temptation

I bought this over a different product because I liked the smiley face/frowny face options & they don't even work. The frowning face is on there all the time regardless of the weather. It's kind of depressing. Also I think it's off by about 1 degree in general.

When  i did , there was no time display.  I waited for possible transmission overnight and positioned it to the north and the south sky, still no time. I changed the batteries several times, no results.  I will never buy this brand again

This item was a disapointment. Looks great in the picture but is cheaply made. Peices of the wicker were coming loose. The item is also very short. I am 5ft 10 and my feet stick off the end by a couple of inches. I guess you get what you pay for. If you spend $800-$1000 you will get much better construction and at the end of the day will last longer than this

This tray does not fit nicely inside the tool box grill.. it is about 2 inches short on the end and about a 1/2 inch too narrow.  This causes it to slide and bang around inside the grill when transported.  The tools have a very "cheap" feel to them. The tongs were the worst.. the handles are loose and they are prety much useless.  The knife won't hold an edge.  The spatula and tongs are marginal.  I would not recommend this item

There were problems with this outdoor fireplace right from the start. First,CharBroil failed to include the hardware for the fireplace to be assembled. It must be a common occurence because in huge letters, on the 2nd page of the manual, is the question "ARE YOU MISSING PARTS?"  Then, CharBroil did not make it easy to just get the packet of nuts and bolts. After calling the number that was provided, I was told proof of payment for the specific model had to be sent in first. After sending the required info, the missing hardware arrived in about two weeks.  Once assembled, it worked fine but it rusted some over just one summer's use and had to be touched up with heat resistant spray paint. The side screen doors flap in the wind because there is nothing to secure them in place. The rating of one star is because this just is not a quality product and CharBroil made me jump through the proof of payment hoop just to get the missing screws.

Bought a pair of these chairs to use at the beach. My chair collapsed within an hour on the first day at the beach while I was sitting in it reading. The mechanism for the recline positions is made of soft and cheap plastic and will not hold for long. I'm 200 lbs. My wife's chair showed signs of the same bent plastics and she's only 110 lbs. I returned them and will buy new ones with metal mechanisms

As a field biologist involved in hummingbird studies in the SW, I can say that red--or any other color--dye is nonsense!  NOT needed, quite likely harmful.  Also, I question the instant nectar--instructions say it doesn't require boiling.  Is there a preservative in it that retards yeast and bacterial growth?  If so it would likely be extremely harmful to the gut of the hummers: it could harm their natural internal flora

THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT STATE WHAT THEY USE FOR THE RED COLORING IN 
THEIR NECTAR.  IT IS A WELL KNOWN FACT THAT RED DYE #40 HAS PROVED
HARMFUL TO HUMMINGBIRDS CAUSING CANCER AND IS NOT NECESSARY.

NATURAL NECTAR IN THE WILD IS CLEAR WITHOUT COLOR.  USING A COLORFUL
FEEDER WILL ATTRACT THE HUMMERS AND NOT HARM THEM.

You won't find a single expert on hummingbirds who recommends "instant nectar" products such as this one. Why? Because 1) they're a complete waste of your money and 2) they expose the birds to ridiculously high concentrations of inadequately tested chemicals. The cheapest and easiest feeder solution also happens to be the closest in chemical composition to natural flower nectar: a solution of 3 or 4 parts water to one part ordinary white sugar. If you want the sugar to dissolve faster, get additive-free superfine baking sugar. DON'T use honey, food coloring, Kool-Aid, Jello, or any other junk - the birds drink nectar just for the energy and get everything else their bodies need from eating insects

I purchases this Gazebo and I thought it was a quality product, and found out after I erected it that it is made very cheap...The canvas looses color in about 2 months and the tie down clips for the top starts to rust and the elastic will stretch soon after....                                              Now when the wind hits the top it flaps and no longer is stable...             then the hold down clips one by one breaks off now the canvas top is at the mercy of the wind. I lost my canvas top one night and it riped off and destroyed the frame...to make a long story short..THIS PRODUCT IS JUNK AND DON'T THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY ON IT.....To make matters worse I contacted the manufactor and was told that they were no replacement parts avalable....

You should stay away from this one: 

My wife an I bought this gazebo to use on our back patio. From the start it was a problem. The directions (probably translated from another language) were confusing. Beyond that, the letters on the diagrams and the letters on the parts themselves DID NOT MATCH, making it even more confusing. We did manage to muddle through. 

The gazebo uses cheap plastic hooks to hold the screens and canvas sides. When it arrived, some of the hooks were already broken. Within a couple of weeks of wind, more had broken. Replacement hooks are not available from the manufacturer.

Unlike the other reviewer, we did not find a problem with the stability of the structure. OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM is with the top. After the first summer, the nice chocolate brown top faded to a very light tan. The side also faded, but in a very uneven manner. We also noticed that where the clips attached to the fabric of the top there was fraying. By the end of the second summer, most of the clips had broken loose from the top, rendering is useless. I contacted the manufacturer, BOND MFG., who refused to sell us a replacement top. WE NOW HAVE A $500 PILE OF JUNK!!!!

Not at all what I expected. I started to install it and a light wind blew causing the structure to fall and bending it. I know its not an expensive product but I expected a better quality. Also I recieved it with some of the curtain hooks broken.I am going to return it

This clock worked fine.... until Congress changed the timing of Daylight Savings Time.  I have three other "atomic" clocks and two weather stations and all of them reset themselves to the new DST except this one.  I've "forced" a number of resets by removing and even changing the battery.  Each time this clock goes to the one of the 4, 8 12 positions and sits there until it receives the signal from Boulder.  Then it resets itself but always to Standard Time, one hour early.  I'm in the Eastern zone so I can't "cheat" it into showing the correct time and this model doesn't have provisions to set it manually.  La Crosse makes a big deal on their website about how other manufacturers leave you in the lurch on the DST thing but they have it covered.  Not.  And when you try to contact them they don't answer their phones and ignore customer emails.  Look elsewhere

I received a painful injury and almost lost my finger to this recliner. I grabbed the arm rest, and tried to slide back into the recliner. The mechanism under the arm rest snapped closed on my finger. I could not get out of this "trap". Had my wife not been there to help, I would have lost my finger. No way should this chair be sold to an unsuspecting public!

This reclines is as advertised. It is comfortable and great to use.

UNTIL a pivot bolt self locking nut backs off and the sholder bolt seperates allowing the chair to come apart causing the frame to bend when you wind up on the floor. This is the bolt that you raise and lower yourself from reclined to sitting positions.

BTW this happenerd today 7/25 and the chair was ordered on 5/31

The threaded part of the bolt is not lonf enough for the self locking nut to do its job.

Today is Sept. 4th 2005 an update on my Lafuma experience.

Called two days ago to the Lafuma people asking where my repair parts are, boy did they play dumb. Said I never called about broken chair parts. 

DO NOT buy this chair based on thier lousy customer service.

BTW they said this is a known problem with thire chairs, why then don't they correcxt it

My husband was so excited, when he got this station and could not wait to get it set up.  He is a phone guy so he wired it all up under the house and spent many hours setting it up just right, only to have issues with 
the wind barameter.  We have tried to trouble shoot with the online and 
handwritten manuals.  

Unfortunetly there is no one to contact nor is there an option to return this product once you have it out of the box.. sooooo needless to say the 
excitement is gone..

Despite what it says on the Amazon web page AND what it says on the packaging itself, this does not fit my Genesis Stainless Steel Gold C Gas Grill purchased in April 2003 (it's about a half-inch too short). 

After finding out it didn't fit, I called Weber to find out what the deal is. After some checking and re-checking the Weber customer service rep said they don't sell the warm-up basket for my model of grill via retail outlets, and the only way to get it is from Weber directly. It cost a few dollars more but they didn't charge for shipping.

Fortunately Amazon's stelar customer service provided a prompt refund and did not charge me for return shipping;

I called Weber to verify the basket fits my Genesis silver B model and WEBER factory customer service informed me this item does not fit my model, which they had registered and knew what model I was referencing.  The guidance on many Weber accessories is incorrect according to what Weber customer service reps. are telling  customers.  Either Weber CS is wrong or the Weber person filling in the detail on the items is wrong.  I strongly suggest Weber managment cross check all detail on Amazon for accuracy and/or straighten out their service reps..  This was a bad experience and occurred on multiple accessories I was trying to buy.

I am already on my second unit. I managed to get three uses out of the first one. I should have ordered the second when I saw the first one start smoking halfway through draining the turkey fryer. (No, the oil was not hot, it was at room temp.!) THe only reason I gave a second star is that it did work well, once. I really wish Eastman would re-design this to make it durable. I've given up and use PVC tubing from Home depot and a funnel with cheesecloth to get the residuals out. Good luck to anyone who wants to use this a second time

You should remove this merchant. They have numerous complaints on multiple websites. I ignored it and trusted amazon's brand. However, my experience was Horrible - they over charged me and when I called to rectify the issue, they weren't interested in trying to solve the problem, but simply place blame on me. Then the service rep hung up on me. I'll never do business with them again.

one of the most important features that should be told is how far down the ground a metal detector can detect both coin size and large items. i'm annoyed with this and many other metal detector's descriptions which refuses to mention this more than important point. i'm shopping for my boyfriend and just because of all the annoyance i may just give up and get him a $10 tie for his birthday.

If you read the label on this stuff it says 100% sucrose and that is what this stuff is plain and simple sugar. You're basically paying $10 dollars for something you could get at a grocery store for $1.50. This is a rip off! There is nothing special about this stuff in terms of size color everything!!! Just buy sugar!!!!!

This product to my knowledge is completely untested.  I suspect it because it says it requires no boiling--which sugestes that it may contain a preservative, yeast and/or bacterial inhibitor.  This could not possibly be good for the hummers.

Listen to the experts such as Sheri Wlliamson (Peterson's "Hummingbirds of North America.")  Sugar and water is just fine, filtered water best but NOT distilled

When I bought this product, it was said to be "new"!  However, upon opening the package it arrived in, the cooker was in an already opened inner box.  I though that perhaps someone just opened the inner box to check the item before it was sent?  As I opened the inner box, one of the "legs" on the cooker was broken off and rusted!  I needed to use this right away so I did not send it back.  Now I will have to get this "leg" welded back on!  Beware of the "new" designation!

I bought this item because of a great price, Amazon shipped it regualr UPS and I received it earlier that expected, the box looked in good shape but when I opened it one of the legs was broken off,I thought at first that it must have taken a pretty good hit to do that, so I called customer service and they sent me a return tag and shipped me a new one right out, I got it, opened it and the exact same thing, box was in good shape but 1 leg was broken, I called customer service and again they shipped another one out, this time second day air. I get the third one and guess what, the exact same thing for the third time! I looked at it carefully and each time it was broken at the weld in two areas on the cooker and it had to have been poor workmanship and quality control, it even looked like it had rusted in one weld! I can't say enough about Amazon's customer service,but I wouldn't reccommend buying the banjo cooker by mail order

No matter where I set my temperature controls on the grill, this thermometer always reads the temp at 500 degrees or more. I placed the thermometer in our oven and set the oven for 350 degrees yet the thermometer showed the temp at 450-500. I have called Taylor's customer service on several occasions and they never bother to call back. I would never buy another Taylor product

For the price I paid I expected much more accuracy.  The data it downloads from its external monitor to the PC is terrible.   Even though the unit is synchronized with the atomic clock it still seems to get the dates wrong on the data it stores in its database.  It also has a problem with the accumulated rainfall.  The amount of rainfall according to the database is much higher that what the display shows for the accumulated amount.  The hourly and 24 hour period also tend to behave eratically. You might see an inch of rain in the last hour but when you come back later, the last 24 hours shows only .2 inches of rain.  Strange.  How can you have more rain in the last hour than in the last 24?  Seems backwards.

On the good side, the unit is easy to set up and connects to your PC with existing ports and a cable that is provided.  On the bad side, besides being inaccurate, the analysis software is primitive and difficult to work with.  You are better off downloading a text file and doing analysis in Excel.   

This unit also gives eratic readings with the temperature swinging up and down up to six degrees within a twenty minute window.  I wanted my son to see how the temps over a 24 hour period form a bell shaped curve.  So much for that.  This is probably OK for a first time weather station for my 8 year old but I would not recommend it for any one else since this unit is not cheap.  

One other thing, it only takes a reading every 1-3 minutes so wind speed readings are hit and miss.  You could be getting gusts much higher than what this unit happens to read.  I am dissapointed and annoyed that I spent the money and it is not at least semi-accurate.  I will tell you that I have it set up wireless.  If you use the enclosed hard wire connection option then you will get more frequent readings and maybe even better accuracy.  Good luck and do your homework first.

I received the Lacrosse weather station as a gift. It started out working ok for about 4 weeks. Plagued by software and communication problems I do not recomend it to anyone. The tecnical support team is of little or no help.It all goes back to that old saying,you get what you pay for.
A Very Dissatisified Customer.

I had the La Crosse WS-2310 "Professional" Weather Station for 2 years, and it was NEVER fully functional.  I had to return the unit 3 times, as well as do a store replacement once, and I used the system for a year without the wind speed unit working - I simply didn't want the cost of returning the system yet again.  The software is absolutely horrible, and during the 2 years I had the system, there was never any software upgrades at all.  Given how deficient the software was, this was quite surprising.  For example, there is no calculation of daily rain amounts or monthly rain amounts.  The system is too stupid to differentiate between days.  The date recorded to the simple spreadsheet database is always one day off (yesterday's date is recorded today).  Overall, the software looks to be a high schooler's science project done the night before it was due. If you're going to purchase a La Crosse system, plan on spending money on 3rd party software, as well as allowing about 30% of your purchase price in product return costs. La Crosse tech support is non-existant: call & get a recorded message to leave your number & they will return the call - but they NEVER do... and I do mean NEVER!  Send an email and the same response - NONE!  It's a very frustrating joke.  After 2 years, I gave up and purchased a truly professional system from a competitor.  My only regret was having waited 2 years to throw in the towel with La Crosse.  I give La Crosse 1 star only because there is no 0 star rating

I got this Weather Station last Christmas and have had a few problems with it.

1. The Wind Gauge reads low. During Hurricane Katrina the maximum recorded reading was 28MPH versus gusts of 75MPH. The trees can be bent over from the wind and it reads 5MPH.

2. The unit will just stop transmitting from the outside unit to the base unit. We have changed the batteries in the outside unit 4 times in the past year but continue to have this problem. Better than 50% of the time now nothing works from the outside unit. The range is now down to less than 50ft from the base station. I don't want to move the station any closer to the house because the wind and rain sensors will be impacted.
 
3. The rain gauge does not update very often and it reads significantly lower than the local weather station. It rained heavy last night and the local news reported 1 inch of rain but we recorded 0.2 inches. 

4. The barometric pressure appears to work well. 

There are better buys out there like the Oregon Scientific WMR968 that have a real 330 ft range so save your money

I just tried filling my propane tank with the quick disconnect connector and was told by the dealer that this type of connector has now been banned by the government and he could not fill my tank.  I called Weber and they confirmed this.  Probably a safety concern although I never had a problem.  I will now need to replace my grill LP hose with the screw on type of connector (QCC1 connection).

Shame on me!  I should have read the reviews before I purchased this piece of garbage.  I had the same experience as others--cumbersome to fill, trouble attaching to the window, then the whole thing crashes to the deck.  An atractive price until you find you're charged more than half the price of the item to have it shipped, not to mention the poor quality design. Couldn't give me another one of these ...

Well, I ordered this online as we couldn't find any window-mounted feeders locally. It's lasted exactly two weeks. The problem is the extremely weak design: the 14oz glass feeder is fairly heavy-too heavy to stay attached to any glass with two measly suction cups, as this has. There are somewhat strange instructions with this model, directing the user to &quot;rub&quot; the suction cups for several minutes in order to (supposedly) build up a proper &quot;suction&quot;-then the glass slides into a groove; well, the thing worked at first-until I had to slide out the glass bottle portion to refill it. I did it as gingerly as I could, not disturbing my preciously attached suction cups, refilled it(only halfway!)-and replaced it. About 4 minutes went by-and then the entire thing-glass, suction cups, everything-fell to our deck, breaking into a million thick glass shards...frustrating me, the hummers-and our two dogs, banished from the outside until I could clean up this mess. What a crummy product! And overpriced-although I wouldn't buy it again for two cents. Beware

It is a little difficult to make use of all the watch's features. I am very concerned the watch is stamped on the back "water resistant" but new reports are showing it is not. In fact if it is NOT, we have been misled by the manufacturer. Overall, I can not recommend this watc

I had this watch for a few months, and feature wise it meets all my expectations, but I snagged it in my backpack the other day and the strap with the pins came off.  No big deal I thought, I'll just snap it back in - that's when I noticed that the strap holder had ripped through the PLASTIC casing and was thus unrepairable. Over the few months I have had it, it has also discolored badly on the fake metal casing. Great features, poor build quality. Not recommended

I currently have two feeders in the back yard for the hummingbirds.  I love the way this one looks but the birds don't feed from it and I'm not sure why.  The other one will be empty and they still don't come to this one

I use this BBQ with Mesquite lump charcoal and have grilled excellent steaks, and smoked some pork ribs, a chicken, a London Broil and a giant hamburger so far.  No marinade, just a dry rub and on the grill.  The book included has accurate cook times as long as you keep the temperature needle on the "i" in Ideal for as much of the cook time as possible, which is not hard to do.  Make sure to "cure" it before you use it.  This burns off all the smells and chemicals that are in it from the manufacturing. Cure it using the propane burner.   Easy to assemble too

I've had one of these smokers for 4 to 5 years. I'd buy another one if my current wears out... well, well worth the price. This cooks the best chicken, turkey, and, above all, salmon that I've ever tasted. Try marinating salmon filets overnight in teriyaki and smoking for 45 to 60 minutes with alder chips for the most moist, flavorful salmon you've ever tasted

Purchased the rotisserie basket after reading the other reviews. I have found the basket to work great. You put your meat in to be grilled and clamp down the pieces. Very easy. With Rock cornish game hens though, I needed to tie them a little bit, but that is because the little legs are . . .well little. Never had one before just the skewer kind. Cleans fairly easy too. Love it.

I got this to go with my new Silver B Weber and I had the best chicken and ribs that I've had in a very, very long time. It is extremely simple to assemble, operate and most importantly, to clean. I've had two different rotisserie ovens that I dreaded to use based on the cleaning factor alone. Cleaning this is quick and easy. The small parts get clean by simply placing in hot,soapy water in the sink. I plan on using this a lot.

Just to make sure people don't make the same mistake I did, be aware that this is NOT compatible with the Weber Q 200 Silver Portable Propane Gas Grill. Amazon.com lists this rotisserie as an accessory for the Weber Q 200, so it is Amazon that deserves a low rating so I have just given this the current average of 4 stars

This is a nice rotisserie.  It could use another basket to keep the meat from getting away from it as it cooks (and shrinks in the process).  You will need pliers to tighten and loosen the baskets

I bought this clock last week. 
Amazon was prompt in shipping it on time.
On having received it I place the AA battery in the clock selected the time zone place it on the wall after some time the clock second hand and hour hand started moving fast. It is actually searching for the signal. If it gets it immediately the time will be set accurately in 5 minutes. 
If not every hour the clock searches for the accurate time relayed from the colorado server. The clock finds the time signal within the next 4-5 hours. The chances of the clock finding the signal is high over night when there is less distortion. 

Once ir receives the accurate time it will never fall behind. 

A very good time piece

We got the clock, read the instructions, installed a battery and hung it on an East / West wall.  After the sun went down, the clock was able to receive the station and set itself to the correct time.  It has worked flawlessly for the last two months since we got it.  It's nice to have the correct time all the time and the kids don't worry about getting out on time to catch the bus because the clock is off

I had to return my 1st order due to mould on the wood (around the joins) and inside the glass front. My replacement has a little mould inside the glass front, but I decided I could live with it.. I blame Amazon's storage for this rather than the manufacturing of it by LaCrosse.

The glass front is spherical, so tends to get weird light reflections, so watch for this when you are hanging it.

Note that when the battery is low, the second hand will move in 2 second jumps to let you know that the battery is low - this is a feature, not a problem, which I like.

Other than that it works great! (I live close to Boulder and NIST, where the radio signal comes from, so also take this into account when ordering any radio controlled clocks).

The short of it is that this clock performs its job quite admirably. You insert a single AA battery and then press on one of four buttons on the back to tell it whether you are Eastern Time, Central Time, Mountain Time, or Pacific Time. Wait a bit - mine received a signal about 3 minutes later, some people have to wait overnight. It receives radio signals from Colorado and it will readjust itself nightly to keep near perfect time. It will also factor in Daylight Savings Time. These it does well - and so it gets 5 stars because it does what it is supposed to do.

However, if you live in the east coast, you must recognize that you are farther away from the radio source. This clock may not be able to set itself unless, for example, placed near a window. This is NOT a fault of the clock, but rather a limitation of the radio waves.

Otherwise, the clock seems well made, the wood looks real, and the numbers are easy to read from a distance

One thing which mystifies me is how few people have embraced the latest in modern clock technology: radio controlled clocks which keep exact time by automatically synchronizing themselves with signals broadcast from the incredibly accurate U.S. atomic clock in Boulder Colorado. Such clocks are not only always accurate to a fraction of a second, they also automatically set themselves to and from daylight savings and standard time as appropriate. Furthermore, such clocks are typically quite reasonable in price. Yet while most Americans have, for example, the latest in modern cordless phones and cell phones, relatively few have the accuracy and convenience of radio controlled clocks. This model is just one of many styles sold by Amazon and other vendors. Try one and I think you'll be glad you did. My wife and I have several of these clocks throughout our house and take accurate time for granted, no what time system is in effect

The brush does a good job of loosening grit and grime from your grill, but you are still going to have to break down and wash the grill with soap and water now and then.  The brush has a strong wooden handle, leather loop, a sturdy set of bristles, and a grill scraper for tough jobs.  Be sure to buy this longer brush as the 12-inch one does not have the reach, especially for larger grills

This little scraper will get your grill cleaner than just soaking it in the sink.  It scrubs all the excess off with ease and leaves even the dirtiest grill clean.  Sturdier than any other brush I or my family has used.  The one we have now has lasted quite a long time.  It cleans each rail on the grate beautifully.  

The wood on the handle will become dirty so keep it clean

The clock set itself right away during the daytime and it performed very well from that point on. All I had to do is put a battery in it and hang it on the wall facing the general direction of Colorado and I experienced no problems with it then or now. I would advise anyone to get one of these clocks since they perform well and are accurate

This clock set itself within a few minutes and has worked well for the few months that we've had it. I loved not having to climb up and get it down to re-set it for daylight savings time!

Just so you know, this clock is not silver in color (I thought it was from the picture). It's more of a pearlized off-white

I've bought two of these atomic clocks. The first, a 12" wood framed model, soon stopped keeping accurate time and started acting unpredictably. The second, this model, has been on my wall for a week and is keeping good time after an easy setup: insert battery, push EST button. 

I am nicking it a star because it makes a noticeable tick sound in a quiet room, making it inappropriate for a bedroom

Have purchased 2 of these for my office and am buying 2 more for home.  These are easy to set up, easy to read, and the self adjusting daylight savings time with the "atomic" function (self setting) is wonderful.  Earlier reviewer mentioned how to reset when battery needs replacement which I found very helpful, so keep the set up instructions handy to refer to if and when you need to replace the batteries!  Also purchased 2 of the larger 14 inch version and they're just as nice

This is a great clock. Looks good, makes no noise, and very easy to read.
Setup should be simple, but I would suggest adding a button to change from manual to automatic. You usually don't get the clock at midnight and you want to setup it right from the beginning. Since it's not going to be able to sync early in the afternoon, you want to set the time manually and leave the clock to sync at night. But this is where an additional button comes in handy, cause moving the hands is done with the same button and its hard to know if the clock was left on automatic or not

I have purchased 2 of these clocks now. The moment I inserted the batteries in the clock started advancing and stopped at 4 'O' Clock. I was getting ready to ship it back thinking that it was a bad clock. But within 5 minutes both the clocks received the transmission and corrected themselves to exact time. So moral of the story is don't return the clocks without giving it some time as it looks like these clocks stop at 4 and doesn't move at all till it receives the time

In considering that I purchased this item for my bedroom, I would have to say that it is perfect.  For aesthetic reasons I preferred an analog wall clock, but the thought of hearing the second hand tick all night was not an option until I found this item by LaCrosse.  It could not be anymore perfect, as its looks, PRICE, and self (time) adjusting qualities has made this an. "M.F." (Major Find).  Now I can sleep through the Daylight Savings time adjustments not having to worry about the actual adjustment of my clock, but whether or not I will be an hour early, or late to work

We bought this clock to replace one of those cheap quartz wall clocks in our new (used) motorhome. I wanted it so that I would not have to wear a watch but would still have a dependable and accurate time piece. 

It took a couple of nights before the LaCrosse atomic clock received the signal to synch up, but after that it seems to be working exactly as advertised, accurate right to the second. 

This clock has a large protrudance on the back where the clock's works reside so the bezel does not sit flush to the wall. Either a large hole needs to be cut in the wall or you just have to live with it. No big deal, but it is something difficult to see from photos on the Internet. This is why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars

NOTE: the Amazon description does not include dimensions.  On the package it recommends that you measure first.  It fits smokers that are 30" (76cm) across (perhaps including handles, not sure) and are 36" (91cm)vertically.

It's a bit big for my standard-sized smoker (about 20" across), so it is unflattering to its graceful curves, but good enough to be useful.

It is cheaply made, but looks like it will be suitable.  I will update my report if it falls apart in use (like another reviewer said).

It is quite possible that a garbage bag would be enough to protect your grill.  The main advantage here is that it fits a bit better, and has elastic to close the bottom a bit.  It probably looks a bit better, if you care

The description doesn't do this rib rack justice.  This thing is pretty big and will hold a LOT of chicken.  You will certainly not complain about running out of room!  Even though it might be an exaggeration to think it can hold enough chicken to feed the entire neighborhood, there's enough room here to hold enough chicken for a family of 7 or 8.  Washing it may be a problem.  Just wash it immediately after using it

This is a good rack; it cleaned pretty easily and a nice compact size but the ribs are just a bit too close together (I cook mainly full spare ribs).  I have rib racks from Steven Raichlen that are perfect.  The more spacious racks allow for better basting, heat distribution and more even cooking.  When the meat touches like in the Weber rack, the meat doesn't cook as well

I had purchased a Brinkman Electric Smoker and needed some rib racks.  I looked around and found the cheapest price for these racks was from Amazon (which included free shipping since I purchased 2 racks).  I bought 6 racks of ribs, cutting each rack in half.  They all arranged perfectly on the racks and we had some great ribs.  Clean up was easy too.  All the grease came off and they are ready to use again.  Good construction on the racks.  I definetly got my money's worth on this product

I have been using this rack all summer and still have yet to see it rust as someone mentioned in an earlier review.  The rack is certainly a space saver and comes in handy when you have a lot of grilling do.  I have used it when smoking chicken and ribs in my Weber Kettle, and noticed that the meat may tend to touch when placed in the rack so not all areas may be exposed to the smoke.  If this happens, I may rotate the pieces or just leave it like it is since I'm not entering anything in a competition!  Everything still has the same great taste but the parts that were not exposed to the smoke will have a different color.

I have a Weber "Q" BBQ Grill, and if you are cooking a lot of ribs, you can handle a lot more by placing them in this rack and still have room for hot dogs and/or hamburgers...plus it keeps the ribs from sticking

Great looking and quite large. Easy to see from a distance, though the other two dials are correspondingly small. Updates quickly and automatically and is unfailingly accurate. I wish that I had a dozen of them. The price is very reasonable also. I certainly will buy more of these clocks eventually.

We bought this clock to use indoors. Living in Florida, our power service isn't always reliable - especially during hurricane season. So having a battery-operated, atomic clock is perfect for us!

When folks visit, they always comment on how nice the clock looks. The bronze finish is muted, and it doesn't clash too badly with the muted silver finish on most of our fixtures.

And for $45 and no shipping, we couldn't beat the price on ebay, overstock.com, or any onther online companies.

In other words, we're very pleased with our purchase

I love this clock! It's big enough to see from all around the back yard, and looks great. Keep in mind that they recommend keeping it sheltered from extreme weather... we have ours under an upper deck, so it's sheltered from the rain. That's about as extreme as the weather gets here in Los Angeles

Used it for a tri-tip last night and it came out wonderfully.  Cranked on high to initially heat it up, then we left it on low and it kept the 400+ degrees no problem (it actually got too hot according to my instant read thermometer!).

Some of the complaints here say that the burner is too loose.  That's because they used the wrong washer to mount it!  There's one washer that's larger than the others.  Use the wrong one and it'll be loose

Works great. Cooking space on grill holds a large amount of meat, fish,etc..  We would like to see a canister that holds more gas than for cooking only five meals.

a week ago i got this gas go-anywhere , i was not sure if it's the right one or not cuz of some negative reviews , so before i opened the box i desided to return it back , but i said to my self why dont we give it a chance , so i opened it and i used it for 2 steak rib-eyes and...ohh my God it's immazing , ok..it's exactly like the big gas bbq gril but smaller ,so it has a very smart wat to hold ,... the meat did not burned up it was like tender ,so if u have a small family and u dont have enough room for big one get this one ...it did a good job with the steak so i think it'll do great with anything else ...i'll try chicken today ...

Purchased the rotisserie basket after reading the other reviews. I have found the basket to work great. You put your meat in to be grilled and clamp down the pieces. Very easy. With Rock cornish game hens though, I needed to tie them a little bit, but that is because the little legs are . . .well little. Never had one before just the skewer kind. Cleans fairly easy too. Love it.

I got this to go with my new Silver B Weber and I had the best chicken and ribs that I've had in a very, very long time. It is extremely simple to assemble, operate and most importantly, to clean. I've had two different rotisserie ovens that I dreaded to use based on the cleaning factor alone. Cleaning this is quick and easy. The small parts get clean by simply placing in hot,soapy water in the sink. I plan on using this a lot.

Just to make sure people don't make the same mistake I did, be aware that this is NOT compatible with the Weber Q 200 Silver Portable Propane Gas Grill. Amazon.com lists this rotisserie as an accessory for the Weber Q 200, so it is Amazon that deserves a low rating so I have just given this the current average of 4 stars

We got the clock, read the instructions, installed a battery and hung it on an East / West wall.  After the sun went down, the clock was able to receive the station and set itself to the correct time.  It has worked flawlessly for the last two months since we got it.  It's nice to have the correct time all the time and the kids don't worry about getting out on time to catch the bus because the clock is off

The short of it is that this clock performs its job quite admirably. You insert a single AA battery and then press on one of four buttons on the back to tell it whether you are Eastern Time, Central Time, Mountain Time, or Pacific Time. Wait a bit - mine received a signal about 3 minutes later, some people have to wait overnight. It receives radio signals from Colorado and it will readjust itself nightly to keep near perfect time. It will also factor in Daylight Savings Time. These it does well - and so it gets 5 stars because it does what it is supposed to do.

However, if you live in the east coast, you must recognize that you are farther away from the radio source. This clock may not be able to set itself unless, for example, placed near a window. This is NOT a fault of the clock, but rather a limitation of the radio waves.

Otherwise, the clock seems well made, the wood looks real, and the numbers are easy to read from a distance

One thing which mystifies me is how few people have embraced the latest in modern clock technology: radio controlled clocks which keep exact time by automatically synchronizing themselves with signals broadcast from the incredibly accurate U.S. atomic clock in Boulder Colorado. Such clocks are not only always accurate to a fraction of a second, they also automatically set themselves to and from daylight savings and standard time as appropriate. Furthermore, such clocks are typically quite reasonable in price. Yet while most Americans have, for example, the latest in modern cordless phones and cell phones, relatively few have the accuracy and convenience of radio controlled clocks. This model is just one of many styles sold by Amazon and other vendors. Try one and I think you'll be glad you did. My wife and I have several of these clocks throughout our house and take accurate time for granted, no what time system is in effect

We had to move it about our place in a few different windows before we found one that actually got the radio waves (and we know our directionals here).  So, if you get it, just be patient and leave it overnight in a few different places before you give up

The brush does a good job of loosening grit and grime from your grill, but you are still going to have to break down and wash the grill with soap and water now and then.  The brush has a strong wooden handle, leather loop, a sturdy set of bristles, and a grill scraper for tough jobs.  Be sure to buy this longer brush as the 12-inch one does not have the reach, especially for larger grills

This little scraper will get your grill cleaner than just soaking it in the sink.  It scrubs all the excess off with ease and leaves even the dirtiest grill clean.  Sturdier than any other brush I or my family has used.  The one we have now has lasted quite a long time.  It cleans each rail on the grate beautifully.  

The wood on the handle will become dirty so keep it clean

I use this BBQ with Mesquite lump charcoal and have grilled excellent steaks, and smoked some pork ribs, a chicken, a London Broil and a giant hamburger so far.  No marinade, just a dry rub and on the grill.  The book included has accurate cook times as long as you keep the temperature needle on the "i" in Ideal for as much of the cook time as possible, which is not hard to do.  Make sure to "cure" it before you use it.  This burns off all the smells and chemicals that are in it from the manufacturing. Cure it using the propane burner.   Easy to assemble too

I've had one of these smokers for 4 to 5 years. I'd buy another one if my current wears out... well, well worth the price. This cooks the best chicken, turkey, and, above all, salmon that I've ever tasted. Try marinating salmon filets overnight in teriyaki and smoking for 45 to 60 minutes with alder chips for the most moist, flavorful salmon you've ever tasted

The clock set itself right away during the daytime and it performed very well from that point on. All I had to do is put a battery in it and hang it on the wall facing the general direction of Colorado and I experienced no problems with it then or now. I would advise anyone to get one of these clocks since they perform well and are accurate

I've bought two of these atomic clocks. The first, a 12" wood framed model, soon stopped keeping accurate time and started acting unpredictably. The second, this model, has been on my wall for a week and is keeping good time after an easy setup: insert battery, push EST button. 

I am nicking it a star because it makes a noticeable tick sound in a quiet room, making it inappropriate for a bedroom

Have purchased 2 of these for my office and am buying 2 more for home.  These are easy to set up, easy to read, and the self adjusting daylight savings time with the "atomic" function (self setting) is wonderful.  Earlier reviewer mentioned how to reset when battery needs replacement which I found very helpful, so keep the set up instructions handy to refer to if and when you need to replace the batteries!  Also purchased 2 of the larger 14 inch version and they're just as nice

This is a great clock. Looks good, makes no noise, and very easy to read.
Setup should be simple, but I would suggest adding a button to change from manual to automatic. You usually don't get the clock at midnight and you want to setup it right from the beginning. Since it's not going to be able to sync early in the afternoon, you want to set the time manually and leave the clock to sync at night. But this is where an additional button comes in handy, cause moving the hands is done with the same button and its hard to know if the clock was left on automatic or not

I have purchased 2 of these clocks now. The moment I inserted the batteries in the clock started advancing and stopped at 4 'O' Clock. I was getting ready to ship it back thinking that it was a bad clock. But within 5 minutes both the clocks received the transmission and corrected themselves to exact time. So moral of the story is don't return the clocks without giving it some time as it looks like these clocks stop at 4 and doesn't move at all till it receives the time

In considering that I purchased this item for my bedroom, I would have to say that it is perfect.  For aesthetic reasons I preferred an analog wall clock, but the thought of hearing the second hand tick all night was not an option until I found this item by LaCrosse.  It could not be anymore perfect, as its looks, PRICE, and self (time) adjusting qualities has made this an. "M.F." (Major Find).  Now I can sleep through the Daylight Savings time adjustments not having to worry about the actual adjustment of my clock, but whether or not I will be an hour early, or late to work

We bought this clock to replace one of those cheap quartz wall clocks in our new (used) motorhome. I wanted it so that I would not have to wear a watch but would still have a dependable and accurate time piece. 

It took a couple of nights before the LaCrosse atomic clock received the signal to synch up, but after that it seems to be working exactly as advertised, accurate right to the second. 

This clock has a large protrudance on the back where the clock's works reside so the bezel does not sit flush to the wall. Either a large hole needs to be cut in the wall or you just have to live with it. No big deal, but it is something difficult to see from photos on the Internet. This is why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars

NOTE: the Amazon description does not include dimensions.  On the package it recommends that you measure first.  It fits smokers that are 30" (76cm) across (perhaps including handles, not sure) and are 36" (91cm)vertically.

It's a bit big for my standard-sized smoker (about 20" across), so it is unflattering to its graceful curves, but good enough to be useful.

It is cheaply made, but looks like it will be suitable.  I will update my report if it falls apart in use (like another reviewer said).

It is quite possible that a garbage bag would be enough to protect your grill.  The main advantage here is that it fits a bit better, and has elastic to close the bottom a bit.  It probably looks a bit better, if you care

The cover is exactly what I needed to protect our smoker from the weather. It is strong and appears to be durable.  I felt that the price was fair for this product

The description doesn't do this rib rack justice.  This thing is pretty big and will hold a LOT of chicken.  You will certainly not complain about running out of room!  Even though it might be an exaggeration to think it can hold enough chicken to feed the entire neighborhood, there's enough room here to hold enough chicken for a family of 7 or 8.  Washing it may be a problem.  Just wash it immediately after using it

Keeps the ribs from searing. Lower profile than most rib racks so it is easier to turn rib

This is a good rack; it cleaned pretty easily and a nice compact size but the ribs are just a bit too close together (I cook mainly full spare ribs).  I have rib racks from Steven Raichlen that are perfect.  The more spacious racks allow for better basting, heat distribution and more even cooking.  When the meat touches like in the Weber rack, the meat doesn't cook as well

I had purchased a Brinkman Electric Smoker and needed some rib racks.  I looked around and found the cheapest price for these racks was from Amazon (which included free shipping since I purchased 2 racks).  I bought 6 racks of ribs, cutting each rack in half.  They all arranged perfectly on the racks and we had some great ribs.  Clean up was easy too.  All the grease came off and they are ready to use again.  Good construction on the racks.  I definetly got my money's worth on this product

I have been using this rack all summer and still have yet to see it rust as someone mentioned in an earlier review.  The rack is certainly a space saver and comes in handy when you have a lot of grilling do.  I have used it when smoking chicken and ribs in my Weber Kettle, and noticed that the meat may tend to touch when placed in the rack so not all areas may be exposed to the smoke.  If this happens, I may rotate the pieces or just leave it like it is since I'm not entering anything in a competition!  Everything still has the same great taste but the parts that were not exposed to the smoke will have a different color.

Bought this to use with my Weber Smokey Mountain.  I almost bought a Sunbeam rib rack for half the price at the local home improvement chain but it seemed a lot flimsier.  This rack is solid and built with Weber quality.

The one reason I can't give it 5 stars is because the Sunbeam rack has skewers for potatoes and I would really like to see that on this rack.  

If the ribs are too big, I just wrap them around the wrap quite easily

I bought this clock for my pool deck and it works great - it set itself within 10 minutes of putting the battery in.  I have it on a wall that has an overhang that is about 4 feet, so it is protected from the weather.  You can see it well from across the yard.  Have had several comments from visitors - they think its a great outdoor clock.  The thermometer is not automatically set, you need to set it.  It seems to work fine, I have checked it a couple of times with the local temperature on the radio/tv.  Would recommend the clock to those looking for an outdoor time piece

Great looking and quite large. Easy to see from a distance, though the other two dials are correspondingly small. Updates quickly and automatically and is unfailingly accurate. I wish that I had a dozen of them. The price is very reasonable also. I certainly will buy more of these clocks eventually.

We bought this clock to use indoors. Living in Florida, our power service isn't always reliable - especially during hurricane season. So having a battery-operated, atomic clock is perfect for us!

When folks visit, they always comment on how nice the clock looks. The bronze finish is muted, and it doesn't clash too badly with the muted silver finish on most of our fixtures.

And for $45 and no shipping, we couldn't beat the price on ebay, overstock.com, or any onther online companies.

In other words, we're very pleased with our purchase

I love this clock! It's big enough to see from all around the back yard, and looks great. Keep in mind that they recommend keeping it sheltered from extreme weather... we have ours under an upper deck, so it's sheltered from the rain. That's about as extreme as the weather gets here in Los Angeles

Used it for a tri-tip last night and it came out wonderfully.  Cranked on high to initially heat it up, then we left it on low and it kept the 400+ degrees no problem (it actually got too hot according to my instant read thermometer!).

Some of the complaints here say that the burner is too loose.  That's because they used the wrong washer to mount it!  There's one washer that's larger than the others.  Use the wrong one and it'll be loose

While we've used Coleman folding stoves for years, if you have trunk space, there is no reason on earth to limit yourself to a small stove when you can grill with this wonderful tabletop grill. The small tank makes this practical for camping. If you want real barbecue while tenting under the stars, and you camp where a tailgate or a picnic table is available, this is a great choice for camping equipment. We still like the Coleman for boiling water, but I love barbecuing on a propane grill like this

The umbrella I ordered is fine, just what I had hoped it would be. However, I subsequently ordered an umbrella stand (after you prompted me to do so) and when it arrived the two tightening screws  in the shaft had been damaged in shipment. Each of the screws have plastic knobs and the knobs were broken off. As a result when one tightens them the broken plastic is sharp enough to cut skin. I have tried unsuccessfully to find replacements at a hardware store.  Any suggestions

These are very handsome umbrellas that appear sturdy and well constructed. I like the mechanism for raising and lowering the umbrella -- very low tech and smart. My one "issue" with them is really not their fault but my own inexperience in what to look for -- they are totally stationary, and don't have a tilting feature. That might be standard, I just don't know, but I would have wanted that flexibility. Oh, and the wood is nicely stained and the brass fittings are rather shiny but thankfully basically invisible. And they're simple to put together and take apart. Great price and they block the sun and look terrific

Good Quality Umbrella - pole is straight! (redesign?)

Bought this umbrella last week (9/23/05) from Amazon. Was initially hesitant about purchasing it due to other reviews describing the issue with the pole being in two pieces, which, when connected, were never straight. 

All I want to add here is that I did not experience this problem. The screw mechanism which joins the poles seems sturdy, and the pole appears perfectly straight. I wonder if other people had bought umbrellas from a bad batch or that the manufacturer redesigned the connection mechanism? (The most recent reviews do not mention this problem)

Re. overall quality, I can't speak for how the pole or the umbrella itself will wear over time, but at least initially it looks to be of good quality and sturdy construction. One thing to note is that despite the product description and picture making it look like the pole is made of wood, it appears to be actually made of some sort of metal which is wood coloured (it still looks like wood though and would not look out of place with wooden patio furniture). To be honest I actually prefer this, since I would imagine it won't discolour as easily as natural wood and should be longer lasting.

In summary, am very pleased with my purchase - I would happily recommend it to others looking for a good quality umbrella at a very reasonable price

I purchased two of the 9-foot Oxford Garden Market Umbrellas in desperation; we were having a backyard party at our home and my local stores were all out.  When they arrived a short time later, I was very pleased to see how well made they were.  I especially like the pull cord to open and help close the umbrellas.  Not only are these umbrellas attractive, they are easy to use, study, and detail-oriented.  I'll probably get one more before the end of summer

Just received one for a housewarming gift. Have used it twice and am sure it's a "sleeping giant": WHAT A GREAT BBQ!!! A little messier than a gas grill and takes maybe 20 mins for coals to be white hot - start to finish - but what gas grill will get the temperature up to 700 deg!?? Talk about the ULTIMATE in broiling! Super easy to light - push-button ignites w/ propane in 3-5 mins, then wait 15-20 mins and go. Everyone's going to want one of these!!

While the 04' model of the performer is slightly pricier than the latest 05' model, there is no comparision between the two models in terms of design, function, and useability.  If you want the BEST charcoal grill made, your choice should be an 04' Performer!!!

I have owned only 2 grills in my lifetime.  Both were little, cheap and unsuited to my novice grilling status.  

When I committed to buy a real barbeque grill I read scores of reviews and descriptions to find the right one.  After reading Amazon's customer reviews of the Performer (the 827020 22.5 inch Performer Charcoal Grill with Propane Gas Ingnition, purchased in Summer of 2003) I was so impressed I bought it.  

What a grill!  I don't know how Weber does it (convection, perhaps?)--even my overdone meats come out moist and flavorful.  Veggies come out great--I grilled zucchini squash last summer, and YUMM!

This grill gives me the best of both worlds: gas and charcoal.  The gas feature allows me to light up quickly, rain or shine.  The small propane tank is not the primary energy source, so seldom needs refilling. Charcoal gives foods real barbeque flavor, and my gardens love Weber's convenient one step ash disposal system.

I cannot praise this grill enough.  I only wish the newer version inspired more positive reviews, and hope friends I recommended the Performer to can still find this model

OK, I'm not a freak, but I love to grill and I own at least 5 Weber grills.  This one is hands down the best.  I've been using mine since 1993 and it is the one to own. Buy this model today as they have redesigned it without the stainless work area.

It's perfect for cooking, smoking, grilling, etc.  Every Thanksgiving I cook the turkey on the grill and it's a hit every time.  Also, leaves the oven free for other stuff.  This is a mouth watering juicy turkey...every time.

Burgers come out great.  Chicken.  BBQ.  I've done it all on this grill and it's great.  Buy the cover and take care of this...it will be your favorite piece of cookware that you ever purchased.

Thanks Weber...it is the best

This is the most awesome, wonderful, fantastic grill there is out there.  Everyone knows charcol can't be beat for flavor, but it's a bummer to get started.  Weber has outdone themselves by inventing this amazing grill. It is super easy to start the coals, easy to keep clean and looking fabulous, easy to empty the ashes, and easy move around the deck (out of our frequent Seattle rain).  And of course the food we grill comes out delectable.  I am grilling a whole chicken tonight using the indirect method.  A snap with this grill!  It is well worth the price.  WE LOVE IT!!

(Husband writing review:) I use my Lodge Sportsman as often as possible, but sometimes it still has to go into storage for a while. This is a rugged cover that is custom fit, and I appreciate how much cleaner my grill is when I pull it out. Keeps the dust and cobwebs to a minimum; keeps the rain out if you forget and leave it outside. It's well worth it if you're going to invest in the grill.

The Grill Wizard grill cleaning brush does the job of cleaning the grill better than any brush I've ever used. Very little muscle is required to clean the grill, especially if you clean after you cook and when the grill is still warm.

America's Test Kitchen rated it number one, so I decided to try one for myself. I have owned grill brushes from Home Depot, online catalog sellers, etceteras. The bristles, regardless of material, on these brushes end up shedding over time, or if not they crush down and become nearly worthless.

The Grill Wizard eliminates these problems by using a replaceable pad. The pad works great. I'm still on my first pad and have used it probably 10 times or more already. It's a good product and I highly recommend it

Traditional grill brushes quickly clog with grill funk and the wires bend, thus rendering them useless in a short time.  This has a pad that fits any grill, and they can be removed and washed (or replaced).  Rated number one grill brush according to America's Test Kitchen

I got this grill last year as a father's day gift. I'd never smoked any meat in my life but have been a grill-man for a looong time. This smoker makes it easy. I've done ribs, brisquet, pork steaks, chicken. All turned out great, that brisquet especially! Make sure you cure the inside of the grill before cooking anything in it. There are instructions in the box. Also, if your model doesn't come with the built-in thermometer, make sure you order one from the char-broil website. Using a standard oven thermometer wastes time and precious heat

If you're looking to get your first smoker, look no further.  Since it's a horizontal-style smoker, it can also double as a BBQ pit/charcoal grill.  Plenty of room, very versatile.  Treat it well and it will give you a decade of use.

The reason I can't give it 5 stars is because of the thickness of the metal.  If it were a little thicker, there would be much more heat retention.  You can buy smokers with 1/4"+ thickness, but expect to pay at least $600.

This is easily the best smoker in its price range.

Make sure you season the inside of the smoker similar to how you would season a cast iron pan.  As with any smoker, before use, paint the interior of the smoker with shortening or vegetable oil, then start up the smoker and let it smoke for a couple or few hours.

Also, you should almost always keep the chimney vent all the way open.  Use the intake vent on the firebox for temperature control.

I bought this for my bf for a christmas gift.  He likes to bbq on a little propane grill. I guess I should have read the measurements of the tools. They are more suited for a huge grill. But its better than them being tiny. Good quality build. Might want to buy a nicer package to put them in if giving as a gift.

In this part of the world weather forecasts are either scarce or highly inaccurate.  So far this product has worked great.  Its forecasts are quite accurate so you can plan on taking an umbrella with you in the car if it predicts rain, or if you need to wear your bermudas to enjoy the sunshine.  I had an indoor/outdoor thermometer manufactured by radio shack, and this unit can actually read that outdoor sensor so the addition of the two sensors that come with this unit allowed me to know the temperature indoors and in my patio, garage and the kid's bedrooms

Very stylish looking chaise,no assembly required, not unlike Crate and Barrel Atrium, but at a fraction of the price, and maybe not as sturdy.. Made of fixed but flexible metal slats, like IKEA wood slatted base matresses, cushions are needed to use this piece of furniture -I was hopping not always. I bought also a couple of deep seating chairs (read review), the deep seating sofa, 2 ottomans and a couple of side tables

Worked as designed, and veggies, fish, small stuff cooked nicely, basted easily, etc.

A little large - hard to close the weber grill with the handle sticking out, and it's important to keep the grill closed. 

A bit hard to clean, too, but that's just how these things are.

This is one of several similar units that will give good service.

This thing catches mosquitos! It's easy to set up and you dont have to buy propane. It was a lot less expensive than the mosquito magnet and it does what they say it does.

I had one of these when they first came out and loved it.  This one is even better.  I would say it's a must have for someone that has trouble getting a steak medium rare.  Since purchasing this item, I once again have the perfect steak.  I am so glad I found this fork again.  I am one happy person

I've used a lot of grill covers in my time.  This is the best - looks like it will outlast the last few I've tried that just couldn't make it through a year in the hot Arkansas sun!  Colors are neutral though green is more of an olive - but I didn't buy it for the color - bought it for the durability - course 6 months a trial does not make

Highly recommed this grill cover.  The appearance/style is classy with it's subtle colors that work well on the backyard patio.  And it is SOOO durable!  I'm sure it will last for years.  No more ugly black vinyl covers that you punch holes in the first time you try to drape them over the grill.  I'll never use anything else besides this Artisan Grill Cover now!!

  The off-color didn't bother me. I expected that after reading all the reviews. I agree it could have been about 6" lower to the ground.
  However there was a 3" flaw in the stitching of one seam.A bead of Duco cement sealed that up, and it will never be seen on the back side of the grill.
  The heavy duty material looks like it stand the test of time and weather

just got this in the mail for my char-broil grill, so at this point i cant speak for how it hold up over time.  nonetheless, this appears to be an exceptionally sturdy and well-made product.  nice, thick, and heavy, with two layers - a canvas like exterior and a black lining.  for the price, i cant imagine there is a better grill cover on the market.  
the one caveat i would offer is one many reviewers have noted, the color is not as pictured.  the amazon photo shows an almost teal green with a white middle section.  the photos on the product box call the color 'mountain green' and show a forest green type color, with a cream colored middle.  mine, however, is a dark olive color, one that could as easily be called brown ad green, and the middle section is a cool, cement-y grey, not a warm white at all.  
it looks nice, and is a great cover at a great price.  but if youre ordering this to match your patio furniture (i certainly wasn't!) then this is something to be aware of.  
the only other warning i would offer is to make sure it fits your grill.  its a big cover, and not very adjustable.  fits my char-broil grill perfectly, but it would look ridiculous on a smaller grill.  
the only features i would wish for here are a loop or hook on the outside of the cover, so i could hang it up when grilling, instead of just draping it somewhere, and a drawstring of some sort at the bottom, to hold it closed.  still, it is so heavy and well made, im certainly not complaining.

I placed the WS-8249U atomic clock that I bought couple months ago next to this one, and they both showed different indoor temperature and humidity. This one displayed lower humidity ( 47% vs 51%) and higher indoor temperature (80.4 vs 78.9)than the WS-8249U. I have no idea which one is more accurate. The out door temperature was displayed the same because they both received the same signal from the transmitter of the WS-8249U. The WS-8256u is smaller than i thought it was. I prefer the WS-8249U to the  WS-8256u because it has nicer and larger display.

We received this as a Christmas gift and have come to depend
on it daily for time and weather. It displays accurate time,
temperature and weather "tendency" using rising or falling
pressure. It does not display actual pressure numbers, only 
indicating rising or falling pressure. Outside temp. and pressure info is transmitted wirelessly from a small unit mounted outside and has a range of about 200 feet. Quality of the unit is good and I would recommend to anyone wanting to have an accurate time standard to which all clocks and watches could be set

I've used my smoker for 7 years now and I have nothing but great things to say about it. One recomendation is to drill a small hole in the top and insert a metal stem thermometer (about $7) for accurate monitoring of the smoking. You'll get the best results when you can hold the temps at the desired levels. It also comes in handy for checking internal temps of the meat.

After 7 years, the heating element broke and new ones are $40 through Char Broil. I'm appalled that they're so much, and am contemplating buying another smoker instead.

Keeping this smoker up to temperature had been a chore until I invested in a heavy duty 25 foot extension cord. I bought a 12 gage  15 amp 25 foot chord and I'm now actually using the thermostat to back off the temperature.

I got this cord at Lowes and it cost around $18 dollars. The manual  says to use a 50 foot or less cord with your smoker..but it makes sense to use as short of a cord as you can.

Also..thanks for the tip from a previous reviewer about drilling a hole at the bottom of the smoker to allow the excess water to drain out.  

Got to go my Ribs are almost done.

I've owned this smoker for 6 years and have had great success turning out turkeys, pulled pork, ribs, etc.

Couple of tips that took me some time to work out.

1) Cover the water pan with some heavy duty foil after filling it. This'll prevent the liquid from boiling away too quickly. You won't have to refill it during the smoking, and it'll prevent the smoker from getting too "wet" inside. When I left it uncovered, I was getting steamed meat, not smoked.

2) Drill a hole in the bottom of the unit, and get a drip pan underneath it. This'll allow any condensation to drip out rather than collecting in the bottom of the smoker and promoting rust.

3) Get some heavy duty foil beneath the heater element. Makes cleanup much easier, and gets the heat reflected up to the food.

Have fun...

Pros :
Just drop in some wood chips, fill the pan up and you are ready to go.   Very easy to use, not much maintenance.   I regulary pull out the electric element, put in some charcoal and use it for roasting whole chickens, roasts, etc.   I've even just used the bottom piece with charcoal as a grill and it's works great.
You will be surprized how well the food comes out, I have smoked a few hams and friends will tell me its amazing how that little smoker will cook.  You do not need to spend a lot of time getting it fired up, as a wood smoker, and if you want, you could smoke with only wood.

Cons :
Would like to see a temp guage on it.

Overall, you cannot lose out with this smoker, I live in a warmer climate so I have not experienced the problem of the smoker not getting hot enuoph, at times if I want to speed things up, I'll add some charcoal to it.  Can't beat it for the money, and it does not have a very large footprint at all

I recently purchased a Weber Gold Series grill and wanted quality grilling tools that complimented the stainless steel design of the grill. I decided on this spatula because of the quality normally associated with the Weber name and I was not disappointed.  The spatula handle is attractive and has a rubber grip for comfort.  The length of the spatula is great for reaching the back of the grill and for large flanks of fish.  I would highly recommend this spatula for anyone who is searching for a quality accessory to their Weber grill!

I just got this turner and it feels really nice in my hand. The grip feels very comfortable and the turner has a very nice solid and balanced feel.  I got this turner so it would work better with the cast iron griddle I got. I tried out tonite cooking burgers and it felt easier to flip the patties than a normal cheap spatula. I felt like a short order cook!

This unit is well-built, will last, and is easy to use.  Assembly is a breeze.  We have had it almost two years and it performs superbly in all types of cooking-- it heats up quickly (and gets HOT!), yet the flames can be turned way down and never blow out.  We use it several times a week and a propane canister lasts about three to four weeks.  Of course, if you turn all its mighty burners on and leave 'em that way, it'll eat a lot of propane.  But that kind of usage would quickly cremate anything you might be cooking.  I suspect that people who complain about propane consumption with this barbecue are cooking with the hood up, contrary to Weber's instructions (and common sense).  And, let's face it, any barbecue with six mighty burners like these will use its share of propane.

Pluses: 

Thick, solid stainless steel bars sear beautifully and will last forever.  You want solid bars!  The thermal inertia is key to good grilling.  And stainless means no rusty taste, no chipping, and easy to clean.

Fine flame control.  Six burners let you configure the heat the way you want.  The rotisserie and smoker box have thier own burners!  The side burner works well too for cooking veggies and stuff in a pot.  

Powerful yet capable of gentle cooking.

Won't rust.

Built like a tank.

No cheap Chinese componentry as often found in even formerly premium brands, and all "house brands", most of which are made entirely in China, even the big stainless-steel extravaganzas that sell for thousands.  Don't be fooled by fancy knobs and gewgaws-- the quality is just not there deep inside far too many barbecues today.  I've personally witnessed two big top-of-the-line house brand barbecues returned to a leading warehouse retailer by irate purchasers who couldn't believe they'd crap out after a year.  That never happens with Weber.

Convenient fold-down work surfaces.

Easy to clean.

Huge cooking area.

Anti-flare burner configuration works well.

Lights instantly.

Easy to wheel around the yard-- something I wanted to be able to do, and which a built-in wouldn't allow.

Fantastic Weber service.  Mine was manhandled by the shipping company; Weber handled my complaint with the shipping company for me (I didn't have to do anything at all) and sent me a new panel without any hassle at all.  Their 24-hour support hotline is the best I've used anywhere for any product, and emails are handled same-day.


Negatives:

Expensive (but worth it).  I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.  It was my first Weber after years of thinking they were only popular because they're stylish.  Now I get it.

It's hard to do better than a Weber and this grill has not disappointed in the two years I have owned it.  I use it 3-4 times a week and have cooked just about everything you can imagine on it.  I am very satisfied with its performance, but it has a few minor flaws.  I still have my Genesis series propane grill that is still fine after 12 years, but it was not big enough so I moved up.

Pros:
Stainless doesn't rust.
Large enough to cook a substantial amount using indirect method.  Last night, I simultaneously grilled 4 T-Bones, 10 skewers of tequila-lime shrimp, sweet peppers, and bread.  That's why I wanted this grill.  I need room to cook.
Insulated box holds the heat well.
First side burner I've had that actually works.
Assembly was relatively easy.
Strong rotisserie motor.  Spin a turkey or 3 chickens; no problem.
The smoker box w/ its own burner is a great feature.
Stainless grates are better than any others I have used in past.
Lots of shelf space w/ fold-down shelves.
Battery-fired push button starters for all burners is easy and reliable in all weather conditions.

Cons:
Expensive.  But I do expect a long service life.
Gas guzzler.  More than one tank is helpful.
Couldn't find a cover that fits it.  But it is stainless...
Gas gauge doesn't work that well, but no biggie.
The bottom of the cookbox has warped a little resulting in the grates being loose and shifting more than I'd like.  On occasion when cleaning the grates, they will fall into the bottom of the cookbox.  I can work around this and probably fix it without too much trouble, but it does tick me off.  This cost them my 5th star; I expected better.

So I pretty much love this grill and it's a good thing, because I believe I'll have it for a good long while.

Chad, the weird chain on the door is for manually lighting the grill.  It is a match holder on a chain attached to the door so you won't lose it.  Go figure

Overall, this is an outstanding grill. I've had it for a year, and it's been awesome. It Gets hot quickly, it sears food well, and it has all the bells and whistles. 

The stainless steel grates are the primary reason to get the platinum and not the gold. They are worth it, unless you want to use plain cast iron and constantly oil them (which also you'd have to buy). 

A couple of things to consider though:

1. The design is kind a retarded for the smoker box. Using the smoker box and the rotisserie is chore, you can't really open the smoker box because of the spit, and the smoker box seems to want to rely on the grates (which I remove to use the rotisserie) so with the grates gone it will tip over easily. 

2. The grill has blown out a few times. I think this is due to the fact that I don't follow the instructions and turn the gas off when I'm done using it, I just turn the grill off. So the regulator has a protection mechanism that gets tripped, and off the grill goes. So I've changed the way I use it, and it hasn't blown out since. 

3. There are these weird chains in the doors of the cabinet. I have no idea what they are for, and no one has been able to tell me. 


So, if I had it to do over again, I'd get the exact same grill, it's worth every single penny.

This grill has it all, six burners, a side burner, a rotisserie with infrared burner and a smoker box with a dedicated burner.  The grill grates are 3/8" stainless steel rods that provide great grill marks on your food.  The grill heats up to 600 degrees in less than 10 minutes, but it does burn through propane rather quickly, but that wouldn't be any different with any 60,000 BTU grill.  I was able to put the grill together by myself in a little over an hour.  The fit of the pieces was fantastic and the end result was an attractive incredibly stable grill.  It has two pull-up counters with stainless steel inserts, and a cabinet with stainless doors.

So far I have made countless steaks, dogs and chicken breasts that all came out the same due to the even temperature on the grill.  My old Charbroil would give me two raw breasts, two good breasts, and two overcooked breasts... not with this grill.  I have also slowed cooked some ribs with the smoker box going and the meat fell off the bone.  But, the best meal yet was a rotisserie chicken that I prepared with a rub and injected with a marinade.  The skin was crispy and the meat was tender and juicy.   We'll be making many more of those chickens in the future.

Weber is a known commodity.  They are built to last, and given the quality of the components (with care) I expect this grill to last at least 15 years.  Many people end up having to get rid of their Weber's after 10, 12, 15 years because the cart has rusted out, but that's not an issue with this grill as the cart is constructed of 304 stainless steel.

All in all, a great grill that will last a long time.  My only cons would be the propane consumption and maybe the size.  It's probably a little too big for me and my family, but it was the only Weber that had all the features I wanted (mainly the rotisserie and the smoker box with burner).  If they had a four burner model with those options I would have gotten that, but alas the Weber Summit Platinum D4 does not exist

The Flowtron bug zapper is a great product, but bulbs do wear out.  The cost of the bulbs are not cheap, but the destruction of bugs by this unit is very good.  I use this unit 9 months of the year.

Here's what I like about them:

1 - They're metal - I can't tell you how many times I've broken those cheap plastic ones when I was trying to put them into the ground
2 - LED Lights - they have a nice white glow to them, instead of the crappy yellowish glow that normal bulbs put off
3 - The Packaging - EVERYTHING they use for packaging is recyclable (cardboard & plastic bags that are clearly marked with the recycle logo/info

I bought this grill for my husband, as a Christamas gift. He said that it is awesome. He says you can walk away and not worry about anything burning. Also, he says that it heats the food evenly. The warming rack is a great asset too. Finally, what he likes most is that you can control the temperature for each side. Wow what a awesome product

I've been watching silver A for a while, thinking to buy it from amazon while it is on sale. But I finally decided to get it from a local Ace Hardware Store. Here is why:
The pirces are not significant differrent between amazon and Ace. But Ace offered free assembly, free delivery, free gas refill.
And the most important feature to me is: they allowed me to upgrade it to stainless steel cooking grates and flavorizer bar for only $20 extra. (which is $100 value on amazon.)With the regular grates and flovorizer bar, you have to replace it in a couple of years and hard to clean. But the stainless steel type may last much longer and easy to maintain. 

So if you buy it from amazon, you have to pay base price, plus shipping cost, self assembly, gas refill, upgraded cooking grates and flavorizer bar etc. The choice is yours

I bought my genisis Silver A six years ago. Despite some abuse by me (not covering it when it is raining, ignoring grease fires while watching tv, not cleaning it regularly, not replacing the flavorizer bars) it still is going strong and continues to produces the most delicious burgers, steaks and grilled chicken ever. I'm really glad I invested in the weber and not in a cheaper brand. The size, for me is perfect. You can fit a lot of meat on this grill

I just bought a new Genesis after owning my last one for 11 years. Excellent product. There's plenty of product info on this page from Amazon and the manufacturer, so let me tell you a few things that I do to make my Weber work best for me.

-Most importantly...keep it covered. Amazon sells a cover...get it. Not coving it will cut its life in half at least.
-Cover the funnel shaped grease drip pan with tin foil and change it regularly; otherwise build-up in the trap can catch fire and THAT does not make a steak taste very good.
-Change the disposable grease traps regularly (otherwise they start to stink).
-Get yourself a quality wire brush and use it before each use...NOT after. The build-up on the cooking grates after each use actually protects them from the elements.
-Before each use, after you wire brush the grates, put some cooking oil on some paper towels and wipe the grates down.
-Pre-heat the grill on high for at least 5 - 10 minutes; it burns off anything left over from the cleaning and makes the cooking grates nice and hot.
-Initiate cooking steaks, chops, any cuts of meat (even burgers...no, not hot dogs) on just-over-medium heat for 2 minutes on each side and flip before cooking to your liking. This brief searing of each side locks in the flavor of your cut of meat. 
-Cook with a closed cover; normal cuts of meat shouldn't take more than a total of 10 minutes (including the searing).
-Let your meat sit for up to 5 minutes before slicing (or biting into it!). This locks in the juices; if the juices are too hot when you slice (or bite), they'll run right out of your cut of meat.

There you go. Hope that helps. And don't forget to cover the grill after it cools. Bon appetit!

I purchased this grill for my husband four years ago and we are still very happy with it.  It has held up very well.  When we were having problems with it lighting the back burner, I called customer service and they were extremely helpful.  They saved me buying a whole new burner set by explaining to me how to remove the tubes, check and clean them.  We are now replacing the racks and flavorizer bars ($60.00) since they are just too hard to clean after all this time.  I have found replacement parts at Home Depot and Lowes which is a plus to know I can easily get the parts.  I don't see us haveing to buy a new grill anytime in the near future

This is one fantastic grill. It is easy to ignite and heats up faster than Death Valley in July. Cleaning is easy with removable parts. For maximum effect, I suggest some type of grill cleaner to dissolve the carbonized left overs. That will make your BBQ look like new. There's some assembly required which took us about twice as long as the directions say it should, but once you taste your steaks and burgers, you will never be sorry you made the purchase.

Wonderful grill.  Everything we expected.  Shipping a problem. Showed up a week late.  Sat at home for three different delivery dates before the shipper finally showed up.  Grill was slightly damaged - we elected to keep it rather than start the shipping hassles over again.  Not sure the money we saved buying through Amazon was worth it

I was impressed looking at this grill at Home Depot, and was even more impressed at the price on Amazon.com. In using the grill, I discovered that the Weber is truly better than what I have been used to in the past.  The food actually tastes better!

The assembly took a little longer than the 30 minutes given in the instruction sheet. I had a little difficulty in interpreting the pictures, and I feel that some written instructions would have been beneficial

I'm happy with my grill.  Putting it together wasn't that hard.  It took me under an hour also, but one thing to note is that when putting on the right bar with the container make sure the container is placed properly before you completely jam in the bar or else it will be very difficult to remove the bar and properly place the container.  The grilling was great, flames were consistent.  Cleaning is a pain though , but I think thats a pain for all grills.

I put in two AA batteries, went to sleep and the next morning woke up to find the time, moon phase, date and temp set and accurate. Very cool product. I hang it on a wall about 8 feet up and have no problem seeing the display from 20' away and from an angle of 45-50 degrees. It is not completely viewable from the sides, but there is no annoying ticking and it beats my $10 Ikea analog clock hands down. Good for a small apartment.

This is a very nice cover, it is heavy-duty and vented at the rear of the top.  Others say this cover fits tight- and it does, but I can get it on and off by myself.  The trick is, since the cover is a little stiff, you can hold it with one hand above the grill, while you use your other hand to guide it on to the grill.  Then it slides down and fits properly.  

It looks awesome- really sets my grill apart from my neighbors' "unkept" grills! :)

Do yourself a favor and give yourself this gift- a beautiful cover for a great grill. This is absolutely the nicest grill cover I've ever seen, and I've paid 3 times this for flimsy ones. I don't agree that it is too snug, it slipped right over with no tugging, looks very neat and tailored, but I don't like the big billowy ones anyway. Excellent deal, prompt shipping.

Well I like the cover, but I it is hard to put on.  I hoped that it would slip over the grill easily.  It does not, it is a tight fit.  The quality of the cover is excellent.  I just wish they made it a little larger so that it would go over the grill easier

On my porch in my backyard, there used to be tons of annoying insects flying around, because we live very near to a pond and we have woods.  Ever since I got this terrific product, I have been bug free for almost 3 months now!I can go back to having bar-b-ques again!  This is the most amazing product ever created

What is great about the Salad Greens Seed Kit is the AeroGarden. The instructions make everything very easy and it has been such a pleasure to watch the tiny seedlings pop up. Watching the greens leaf out, waiting for them to grow large enough to start harvesting was such a pleasure and then to snip off leaves right in the kitchen to toss into our salad bowls was a real treat - and healthy! We are now watching baby herbs sprout!

This umbrella's quality belies its bargain price. It assembled easily and opens/closes smoothly. The construction seems sturdy, and the fabric smelled freshly laundered when it came out of the shipping crate. My only complaint, and it's almost trivial, is the resin finial faded rather quickly in the sunlight. I'm overall quite pleased with the product and I'm looking for places in my yard to utilize more of these

Great price on this unit.  Saw the same one locally for $159.00 and not the color wood I needed.  Followed directions and works great.  The package was new and item was as advertised "NIB".  Amazon must have gotten a buy on this wood color as it is cheaper than same units with
different wood

We replaced an old, larger and broken Sunbeam "Bug Snapper" with this unit.  This is lighter and easier to handle.  We're in Southern Arizona, so our bug season is just starting.  The unit works great, but upon encountering a really big moth it sizzles for as long as ten seconds . . . kind of gruesome.  If you're dealing with night-flying insects this is the solution

I bought this item based upon the reviews i read and i must say it lived up to the reviews.  It did the job. I bought this late in the summer but the one time i used it i was impressed by the amount of bugs that it zapped in a short space of time. I saw and felt the effectiveness of the product because i stayed in the backyard longer than usual

I have used Flowtron Products for years.  This year coudn't find one locally, and purchased another brand !  Lated one month and
had to replace the Bulb.  The new bulb lasted less than a month.
Total cost was twice that of a Flowtron BK-40.  The Flowtron BK-40 will last "one year" 24-7 year around.  Like a car, weather
and age takes it's toll.  But you'll need to clean the dead
critters off every other week. Finally, found a Flowtron on
Amazon.  Thanks, No critters around my house, big or small

My husband and I recently moved to a very rual area between two national forest in NCA and were being eaten alive by bugs of all kinds.  We purchased two of these units and it has made a significant reduction in the bug problem for us.  We would suggest this to anyone who has a bug problem and enjoys the outdoors.

This is my second bug zapper. Took another brand back that didn't work. This zapper is working great, and that's all thanks to its intelligent design.

Some bug zappers have super small entry holes, and then wimpy little electrodes inside. This zapper is designed to let bugs fly in easily, and it has vertical electrodes that zap bugs. This zapper works really well...in fact the other night it was zapping like crazy because it was hot and the bugs were out. We live in an urban area near a plant nursery, so we'd always have bugs coming in the back door. Now this zapper kills them and attracts them away from our backdoor. Great product

This thing works great. I prefer to keep bottled beer on hand so I never had a chance to make beer can chicken. The chicken I cooked came out perfect. Crispy skin and juicy inside. Excellent! I'm going to dry lemon juice and wine next time. The bottom tray holds all the grease so your grill stays clean. Highly recommended

This product is great for the following reasons:
1 - Stability (your chicken won't fall over during the cooking process as with just a standard can)
2 - Quality is wonderful (not flimsy and cheap)
3 - Dishwasher safe (easy to clean)
4 - Not too big (so that it takes up the whole grill)
5 - Priced well compared to other similiar products 
6 - No worries where the can has been and what inks might come of

To the reviewers who report that the grille doesn't get hot enough, the slightest breeze blows the flame out and you should need to stock up on extra gas cannisters, I would point out:
THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE CHARCOAL MODEL!!
   Once the coals are fully going on mine, nothing short of Hurricane Katrina could blow them out, and with the proper amount of charcoal loaded in, you have all the heat you'll ever need. I have nothing but praise for mine. Nice going, Weber

Set up easily, stores easily, transports easily.  For grilled meals for two [skewered food, sausages, steaks, burgers, fish, corn on the cob] it has grilled more efficiently for us than our big BBQ.  The folding "legs" keep the direct heat off any surface underneath.  With this efficient little griller, we're enjoying patio cook-outs much more frequently than before

I bought the grill for father's day and found it a great purchase. I've been thinking about getting a new grill, but forking over hundreds of dollars for a standup felt a bit much. Even though the price of the go-anywhere grill is cheap, it is pretty solid. I've only used it once so far, but it works nicely. I can fit 4 ears of corn on the grill, 16 chicken wings or 6 teriyaki beef skewers. It took a few minutes to assemble the grill and is brain dead simple. the best part is the portability. I used it for the first time today and as the meat was starting to cook, it started to rain. Thanks to the unpredictable NorthEast weather. Since the grill is portable, I picked it up and moved to the garage. Try that with a standup grill.

I would gladly recomment the grill to friends and famil

This grill is the greatest for simplicity and ease of use. It is compact and portable, so there is no unsightly grill always hanging around  your house or patio. I use it in summer and winter, and even set it up in the snow. If you do charcoal grilling exclusively, as I do, this grill has the flexibility to adjust the combustion air and exhaust to suite what you are cooking. For high temperatures, such as for steaks, I leave the top cover off. Takes perhaps 5 to 6 grillings before one learns all the right charcoal loadings and vent adjustments necessary. Cools off totally in 15 minutes if you close all vents.

The umbrella I ordered is fine, just what I had hoped it would be. However, I subsequently ordered an umbrella stand (after you prompted me to do so) and when it arrived the two tightening screws  in the shaft had been damaged in shipment. Each of the screws have plastic knobs and the knobs were broken off. As a result when one tightens them the broken plastic is sharp enough to cut skin. I have tried unsuccessfully to find replacements at a hardware store.  Any suggestions

The umbrella was quite a score through amazon - including the shipping & handling.  It was still cheaper than Walmart!  lol......additionally, it is of great quality.  We utilize this umbrella for our bistro table and our porch now is all green.  It is sturdy and even withstood being blow over with Tropical Storm Tammy!  Twice

These are very handsome umbrellas that appear sturdy and well constructed. I like the mechanism for raising and lowering the umbrella -- very low tech and smart. My one "issue" with them is really not their fault but my own inexperience in what to look for -- they are totally stationary, and don't have a tilting feature. That might be standard, I just don't know, but I would have wanted that flexibility. Oh, and the wood is nicely stained and the brass fittings are rather shiny but thankfully basically invisible. And they're simple to put together and take apart. Great price and they block the sun and look terrific

Bought this umbrella last week (9/23/05) from Amazon. Was initially hesitant about purchasing it due to other reviews describing the issue with the pole being in two pieces, which, when connected, were never straight. 

All I want to add here is that I did not experience this problem. The screw mechanism which joins the poles seems sturdy, and the pole appears perfectly straight. I wonder if other people had bought umbrellas from a bad batch or that the manufacturer redesigned the connection mechanism? (The most recent reviews do not mention this problem)

Re. overall quality, I can't speak for how the pole or the umbrella itself will wear over time, but at least initially it looks to be of good quality and sturdy construction. One thing to note is that despite the product description and picture making it look like the pole is made of wood, it appears to be actually made of some sort of metal which is wood coloured (it still looks like wood though and would not look out of place with wooden patio furniture). To be honest I actually prefer this, since I would imagine it won't discolour as easily as natural wood and should be longer lasting.

In summary, am very pleased with my purchase - I would happily recommend it to others looking for a good quality umbrella at a very reasonable price

I purchased two of the 9-foot Oxford Garden Market Umbrellas in desperation; we were having a backyard party at our home and my local stores were all out.  When they arrived a short time later, I was very pleased to see how well made they were.  I especially like the pull cord to open and help close the umbrellas.  Not only are these umbrellas attractive, they are easy to use, study, and detail-oriented.  I'll probably get one more before the end of summer

My old Grill was well over-due for replacement, and so I started doing some research into a replacement. My previous grill was a Coleman, and had lasted a good 10 years, although the cooking quality had definately deteriorated.

I was going to purchase another "cheapy" grill, but in my research, I noticed something - almost every Weber owner rated their grill 5-star, whereas the cheapies usually mustered three stars at best.

A little more research quickly pointed out why - Webers may not last any longer than the cheaper competitors, but a 10-year old Weber still cooks better than the cheap ones do when brand new.

I invested in the "Platinum C". but have yet to use the side-burner, so I'm not sure how valuable that is. I was delighted with the quality of the Grill - it was easy to assemble, and the cooking quality is - fantastic. I purchased a Weber Griddle, and I also have a Pizza stone, and with these two additions, I cooked 8 meals in a row on my Weber, including Bacon and Eggs, home-made bread, pizza, and of course, grilled steak

My 15 year old son put the grill together while I was as work.  The grill has a very even heat distribution and very good heating controls.  I have cooked steak at high temperatures and chicken at low temperatures. All items have come out great so far.

The stainless steel cooking surfaces and internal parts appear like they will last along time.  My last Weber grill lasted for about 12 years. I expect that this one will do as well or better.

My only disappointment was that this grill did not come configured for quick-connects like the last grill did.  It uses the standard screw type connection for the gas bottle

I heard that this grill was "only" 36000 btu, and was not as hot as some other grills.  Believe me, this puppy is plenty hot if all you are going to do is cook food!  Disregard this btu rating.  This btu rating is rubbish.  This grill will transfer so much heat to your food so fast that if you're not used to cooking with a high-quality grill you will turn your beautiful porterhouses into charchol (I used a custom-cut 3-inch porter house to break in my new grill, and to my surprise, it was closer to well done than I prefer, but still DELICIOUS!)  Everything is high-quality.  It is much more solid than all the other grills I looked at, and the grill is very even in terms of heating.  Besides, it is beautiful.  The side burner was not something I was really interested in, but I just went for it.  I used it the first time.  THIS is the grill you need

At first the thought of spending $750 on a grill seemed insane.  Then I started adding up all of the $250-$350 grills I've had to buy in the 7-years I've owned my home. Based on reading hundreds of reviews, I figured that a stainless steel grill made by Weber would be the last grill I'd have to buy.  I think I might be right.

I bought the natural gas version, which I would highly recommend.  No more messing around with propane.  Just turn on the valve and you've got flame.

I've had the grill outdoors for 4 months now (somtimes covered, sometimes not) and there are no signs of any corrosion anywhere.  The stainless steel cleans easily and polishes up nicely.

The drip catch system is higher quality than I've seen, with a ceramic coated 'funnel' that drains juices down to the tin catch pan. Nothing collects near the flames so flare-ups are minimized. The 'flavorizer' bars immediately incinerate any grease that falls on them.  The grill is easy to dismantle for cleaning.

The front-to-back burners provide perfectly even heat and a lot of it.  The thermometer on the grill easily spins past the highest marking of 600 degrees.  At these temperatures steaks sear nicely and the grill is almost 'self cleaning' since any stuck-on food is almost completely incinerated.  Anything that remains on the grill easily scrapes off the stainless steel grates.

The front-to-back burners also allow you to use the grill like an oven.  By shutting off the center burner, you can use indirect heat to cook food without searing it. The insulated hood keeps heat inside which makes the grill more efficient but also makes it easier to stand next to while cooking (not much heat radiates around the grille).

I'm convinced that this grill is an excellent investment

I have been through atleast 3 grills prior to this one.  I was the type of person that would buy the $200 job from Sears or something and figure I'll get about five years out of this one.  Never did.  2-3 Seasons tops.  This grills you know will last.  Solid, stainless steel, warranties that are more than a couple of months.  Its built to last and gaurenteed to last aleast five years.  It will be worth every penny you spend.

I've had much fun using the rotisserie and my first attempts, a turkey and a pork roast, were quite good!  I anticipate excellent results as I gain experience.  One caveat, it doesn't make sense to buy this unless you plan to cook 10-15 lb roasts.  The instruction booklet doesn't provide much in the way of cooking guidance or recipes, but there's lots of both on the internet.  I suspect that using a rotisserie is easier w/a gas grill, but I've been using charcoal for many, many years...and that's that

I like this Rotisserie's quality, ease of use, and functionality.  The rotisserie fits my Weber Performer grill (which I also like a lot) perfectly, which is no surprise since it's made specifically for Weber's 22 1/2 inch kettle grill.  The spit has a nice chrome finish, as do the forks, and appears that it will last.  

This is my first rotisserie unit, and perhaps this might be common knowledge, but after using it a few times, I found that using the balancing weight works best by first putting your bird or roast on the spit, then inserting the loaded spit in the ring without the weight tightened down or inserted in the motor, so that the spit may find its own balance, which naturally will have its heavy-side down.  Next, I tighten the weight opposite of this heavy side, insert it in the motor, & turn it on.  I then play with the positioning of the weight relative to the spit, but remaining opposite of the heavy side, so that it spins with the least amount of strain to the motor.  (Hope that wasn't too wordy.)  Anyway, I've cooked chickens, a roast, and a 12 pound turkey (hoping to cook a big honkin' turkey soon), all with great success.  

In conjunction with the rotisserie, I've finally discovered the Canjun Injector, the hypodermic needle-like flavor injector.  Using both brings out juicy and flavorful foods.

One other tip...carfully open and keep the box that the rotisserie came in for storage.  I put some self-stick velcro on the box ends, and it keeps this otherwise awkward to store gizmo safe and stack-able.

I plan to buy another rotisserie unit for my Weber gas grill.  I don't know why, but in addition to the more succulent outcome of the food, seeing your food spin around the fire adds to the anticipation of the meal

You may wonder why it took me 20 years to write this review... well after using this rotisserie for all that time, the motor finally stopped working.  So, I got a new motor this week.  And I'm ready to go.

I have cooked just about anything you can put on a stick.  As everyone says, the results are just phenomenal.  I've done 16-21 LB turkeys, standing rib roasts, Leg 'o lamb, pork roasts, chickens, duck, goose, you name it, I've cooked it. Just put the food on, add a few hot brickets every so often, and let her go.

One tip, there are two ways to cook with this.  If you want even heating, don't take the lid off too often. Releasing the heat with the lid off you lose the "convection" effect, but that's not all bad. For some meats, like leg of lamb, where you want the outside crisp, keeping the lid off works well if you stoke your fire to keep it hot.

Finally, Weber's customer service is phenomenal

1st, I've read a thousand reviews and this is my first, yeah, and maybe last.

I've had it 3 months and after month #1 it deserved 3 stars. After month 2 earned 4 stars.... now top rated.

It does chicken best.  The lid (a CON) doesn't fit tight on the rotisserie ring so the fire burns hotter than I would like.  So.... this is what I do:

1- skewer 2 chickens thru the chest-back at an angle.  Then season with a dry garlic herb (or lemon pepper). If you season first then most is removed when skewered. Seperate the chickens with an onion or potato. Don't tie.

2- center the charcoal 6" wide across the center of the kettle from side to side.  When the fire is 1/2 started put the chickens ABOVE the flame.  The fire will burn fully because the lid doesn't seal (remember?).  The flavor is where the flame meets the chicken. No other way will work..

3- Cook for about 45 minutes or til the skin pulls away from the end of the chicken legs.  Looks burnt? The skin might be but the inside is great. Trust me.  Take it off the grill and let it rest about 20 minutes.

Flame still going??  Skewer some red or white potatoes.

 Tastes great and sooo moist!  Pack leftovers in a sealed plastic bag and it will keep a week.  OK, I am guessing on that part.  Mine only lasts a few days..

Another CON is the cost.  It should have included a skewer length basket for holding ribs, fish etc.

So this is the end of my review.  I have bought some junk on the 'net..... but this one of my better choices.

JC,  Tamp

The ring and motor do what they are supposed to do.  The ring did not fit very well, at first, it was able to rock back and forth.  However, after a little bending into shape, it fit more snug.  The way the ring rests on the kettle, there will alway be some gap, which does not allow for a good seal.  I not only use this as a rotisserie, but also to give me more room for beer can chicken.  Its worth getting it for the added flexibility.

My wife bought me this for me a couple years ago. I think she had an ulterior motive: for me to make the Thanksgiving turkey when all of her family came to visit. I did, and it was simply outstanding! I have done several turkeys, chickens, and roasts on this rotisserie and they all turned out perfect with very little effort. If you have a 22.5-inch Weber kettle, you need this rotisserie

This is by far the best grill accessory I have every gotten. It cooks chickens to perfection and keeps them juicy moist and tender. I haven't tried cooking anything else, but I'm sure whatever it was it would come out great. I would definitely suggest this to anyone who has a weber charcoal grill

Just purchased the Weber Platinum B4 Grill,(should have bought that through Amazon too, thats another story), so i needed the cover to keep it nice. Bought it on a Saturday and arrived on a Wednesday. Very nice cover, very thick, almost rubber like vinyl cover. They have improved the cover since the last one i received from Weber. They have enlarged the opening in a way to allow the cover to easily fit over the grill, this is huge really, it used to be like wrestling alligators to get the cover over the grill now it almost falls over the grill and hangs there. Anyway in summation it is very thick, fits and installs really easily and looks great, absolute necessity for investment of a grill thats now over a thousand dollars

This pest repeller works great in my attic repelling squirrels.  The squirrels have broken in three times and are gone within 15 minutes.  I would not use this inside the house because it does make a constant chirp sound.  I can't hear this noise in the attic, so I will buy another when this wears out.

The broken piece was to be discarded.

This is a solid body storage building exactly as advertised. My goal was to store a mower, trimmer, blower, gas and miscellaneous items. I had to build a shelf (not included) notch it to fit and install it before putting roof in place. It works great for gas and miscellaneous items leaving room for taller items but they must be tilted some. If you have a mower with retractable handles (which I do not) it will fit in this building. (So mower is still out) Other than that it has cleared up the mess in the back and locks the flammables up too.

Be careful to read instructions because it would be very difficult to take pieces apart after clicked into place.

If you are planning to store a mower I would recomend a larger unit just for ease of use. This one is great for a lot of gardening supplies but I think they should provide at least 2 or more shelves

You can put up to 6 shelves inside to fully use all the cubic space available. But you may just need 4 and leave the lower two open for big size items to be stored. Rubbermaid has a similar size shed but it can only accept three shelves and waste a lot of spaces. The Rubbermaid shed uses much fewer pieces to assembly than this one. The assmbly is pretty easy if you follow the manu but it does take some time (1-2 hours). After I finished the assembly there were some rain and the inside was try except a couple of water drops. The only concern is its sturdiness since it's assembled with 28 pieces and so far so good. I don't expect it can stand a ternado or hurricane. One thing I wan to alert you: when you buy the shelves do measure the inside and ignore the manu since if you buy the side according it yuo will find the shelves will shift too much to the left or right. You want them more stable, right?

Recommended.

Protecting your grill is important if you leave it outside all the time.  This is by far the best grill cover we have had.  It is easy to put over the grill, the velcro straps keep it from flying off, it fits the Genesis S-320 perfectly, and it is heavyweight.  Recommended, definitely

I tried another rotisserie I got from an auction, and was sadly disappointed.   The mounting brackets did not fit, there was no counterweight, and the meat forks were cheaply made.  

THIS unit however, is great.  First, the mounting brackets are truly "universal", and should fit just about any grill.  Mine mounted perfectly on my Aussie Bonza Deluxe 3 grill without issue.  Installation only takes about 5 minutes.   The mounting brackets allow for various distances between your grill's mounting holes, and multiple sets of holes allow for various height adjustments.   If your grill has two holes on either side, you should be set.

The single-piece spit rod is heavy duty, the counter weight included is heavy enough to assist with balancing heavier roasts (or chickens), and the four-pronged meat forks are well made. 

The motor comes with a long cord (about 3 feet- most other units have much shorter cords!), and the fact that the motor has an on/off switch is a nice plus.    

Lastly, for all the praise I can give this unit, I was also pleased that it's attractively priced.  I have seen many other rotisseries that seem to be much more expensive, and not built nearly as well

I have looked at a couple different Hammocks and for the money this was the most comfotable out of all because of the soft  cotton design.  Definetly worth the money I would only suggest selling with or buying a  frame for it

This a very basic smoker.  It is well built.  Easy to assemble w/ good instructions.  Not much information on the actual smoking process but the internet is full of information. 
No information on how to adjust the vent to make it run cooler or hotter.  Do not think it should matter w/ gas.  It might just regulate the amount of smoke.  I leave mine 1/2 open.

Runs to hot for a smoker when set as the instructions recommended, gas valve 1.5 turns open.  I have mine less than 1/3 of a turn open to achieve 225deg. It took some trial and error to figure out how to get the temp low but once you figure it out the gas smoker works great.

Would have been 5 stars if knob on the smoker was able to adjust the temp low enough.  I keep mine pegged on low

I purchased this smoker last summer.  The assembly was simple.  One piece of hardware was missing, but had no trouble replacing the nut that holds the thermometer in place.  I replaced the factory regulator with an adjustable unit and can get any level of heat I desire.  It is sensitive to wind though.

I found this smoker to be great.  I am not a pro, so take my opinion as such.  I bought this last week and put it together in about a 1/2 hour.  The only problem I had was that a flimsy weld on the control panel broke, which meant it did not hook onto the bottom of the smoker neatly.  It was nothing a little electrical tape could not fix, and was probably my fault for forcing it.  I plan on fixing it with a bolt and nut later this week.  The rest of the unit looks well built.

As far as smoking, it did great.  I put some garlic and water in the water pan, a mix of apple and mesquite in the wood chip bin, and put the smoker on low.  As long as I had the vent wide open it stayed at 175 F.  If I closed the vent the temp got up to 200 F.

The whole chicken I cooked was great.  After four hours of smoking on my back patio, the chicken was moist and had a delicious hint of BBQ.  It was smoking pretty good for a couple of hours.  My wife had doubts about me buying a smoker.  Now she has a BBQ menu planned for next week.

All in all I would recommend this to a friend.  It is easy to use and keeping the heat consistent throughout the smoking is very easy with the propane controls and the vent

Love it!!! Projection of time in soft red light in numbers that are easily read without glasses. Extremely non invasive light. Especially enjoy feature of two separate alarms. Very accurate temperature readings of both indoor and outside temperatures. Well worth the money!!!

This sonic pest repeller works a lot better than others.  It will keep away a lot of rodents and decrease the number of spiders drastically.  You will start to see less and less spider webs and it does not make a whole lot of noise.  I would define tally recommend this over other sonic pest repellers and is well worth the money for how much of a decrease in insects and creatures

The only complaint I have with my gas smoker is that it was damaged when delivered (this was also the case of a friend of mine who ordered the same smoker)it was dented in several places. 
I have cooked as many as 12 whole chickens at on time and they all came out fully cooked and juicey. 
It's a great way to cook. Just put your meat on, adjust your heat then set back and visit with your guest while the smoker does all the work.
After people have tasted my smoked faire they always ask where I got my smoker. Several of my friends have bought this smoker for their own use

Like several other reviewers, my smoker also came badly damaged. I had bought this to use for a going away party and had planned on smoking 25 lbs. of ribs. When it arrived and I saw how badly damaged it was, I immediately e-mailed Amazon and they shipped me a replacement the next day. My replacement also came damaged (worst than the original). It was one day before the party and  I had no choice but to use it even though it was damaged. I must say the ribs turned out great. I am very impressed with this smoker and it's ease of use but had to return them due to the amount of damage both units had. I believe this smoker is well worth the price and would give it 5 stars if they would just package it better.
I also give 5 stars to Amazon for it's great customer service.

This smoker works like a charm! The only regret I have is that it is a bit larger than I expected, I should have bought the next size down. Other than that the times I have used it the results were great. Temperature is easy to control and that was the main concern as I wanted sometime I didn't have to babysit while I was smoking my ribs or pork shoulder. Others have complained about receiving the units damaged, I guess I was lucky, there was a slight crease in one corner but I was able to straighten it out easily. Better packaging would be an improvement. My .02 is that it is well worth the investment

I bought the Great Outdoors Deluxe Gas Smoker for my first smoker and the first time I used it, I cooked two Pork Boston Butt's. I have never used a smoker before and I was worried about the heat fluxuating,(I think thats how you spell it),alot. Once I got the heat set(in about 20 minutes) I put the two pork butt's on and left it till the next morning. I woke up and checked the temp and it was perfect. Everyone who had some of my smoked pork thought I was a proffesional at smoking with my Great Outdoors Deluxe Gas Smoker. I am doing some beef brisket this weekend to see how it turns out. Alot of people have been saying that thier Smoker was in bad shape because of the packing from the manufacturer but the Smoker I bought from Lowe's was packed in a cardboard box with foam supporting everything and nothing was damaged or scratched on my Smoker. I would recommend this Smoker for anyone that wants a Very Good and easy to use Smoker. OH Yeah' It's also easy to clean!

The Great Outdoors Deluxe Smoker is exactly what I was looking for.  The LP gas is great for easy temperature control.  All I need to do while smoking is periodically check the level of  liquid in the pan (and add more wood chunks if desired).  The temomitor is easy to read and appears to be made of good quality.  The only complaint I have is the smoker is not foam protected inside the cardboard box when shipped.  Thus, my smoker had two minor dents in the corner of the smoker.  They do not affect the operation at all.

Down here in southern Mississippi you can sit inside with the AC in summer or hang a hammock in the shade - but this is my best one ever and probably my last one since it's so lightweight I prefer to carry it in out of the weather even though it's so durable.  I've had several rope hammocks to replace each year but this durable fabric one cannot be beat.  The grandbaby loves it

We have an original Hatteras Rope Hammack which we purchased when we lived in North Carolina. I love it but the rope tends to stretch too much and requires rehanging to tighten it. We were informed that it would when we purchased it four years ago, but now it seems to be more work than it is worth. The solid quilted design seems like it would be better and would require less maintenance. Also, our poodle-mix pet just loves it. She would try to jump in before we could even get it hanged. We had to attach a cover to it to keep her paws from going through the ropes, so that adds to the value of the solid design.Thanks for listening to me and we plan on purchasing the guilted hammack as soon as possible

I got this hammock back in November, so I don't know if this hammock will be good for summer, but it is the perfect hammock for winter!  My fiance and I could nap in it all afternoon with a couple of pillows and a blanket in the middle of winter.  It is very comfortable even with 2 people on it.  The surface seems to be semi water resistance.  We left it out in the rain a few times and most of the water stay on top of the surface.  We just turn the hammock, dump out the water, and it dried under the sun in a few hours.  I read somewhere that the green stripes will fade over time, but I can live with it

This is a very neat hammock. It is very comfortable and easy to get in and out of. It does of course not allow air to flow through like a rope hammock, but is so much more comfortable. I also bought the matching pillow and really enjoy the lazy summer evenings now. I roll mine up and bring it inside when I'm not using it, which is quick and easy to do and will make it last that much longer. It will hold to adults, but is a little crowded

i'm new to the world of smoking, and ordered this for when i dont feel like doing the whole charcoal thing.  it works fairly well and the flavor is great, but not quite as much as you get from using a charcoal grill.  i think it was designed to be placed on either side of the grill...i've opted to slide the grates to the sides and place the smoker in the middle...it seems that less smoke escapes the grill this way.  a worthwhile purchase

I got my first Weber (Genesis B) and had to get the smoker and try 'er out.  Kinda wishing I saved my money and just got the smokey mt though... here is why:
    I got my grill at home depot so I would have the nice Cast Iron porcelin enamel coated grates.  When using the smoker you must remove one grate and replace it with a supplemental smaller grate so that the smoker will fit on the side.  This grate does not sear like the cast iron!!!  Weber also does not make a cast iron to fit this size, so when using the smoker, you only get 1/2 of a grill to make nice sears on.
   However, I havn't taken it out since I bought it over a week ago, so I guess the flavor is worth it. ;-)  In regards to the previous review, I have had no trouble smoking a pork sholder for 5 hours, and the smoke was thick and rolling the whole time.  I think the key is to soak the chips for a minimum of 30 minutes (i'll let them soak for hours if i think ahead).  Make sure you load up enough chips - I pretty much filled the tray up.  SHUT THE LID OF THE SMOKER!!!  That part is key!  Especially when heating up the grill.  When heating on high I've found it takes slightly under 10 minutes to start to smolder, turn down the grill now!  Before it starts a full on smoke!!  I wasn't going for "low and slow"... but wanted to maintain a 325 degree oven for the entire time.  I checked the internal temp at 3, 4, and 5 hours getting the pork up to an internal temp of 182 (figured it would rise another couple degrees after I took it off).  The pulled pork was AMAZING!  Plus I got the pink ring!!!  It was my first smoking experience and I fed 10 people with the recipe from Weber nation (i doubled it).  So long story short... if you already have the gas grill and don't want to invest another $300+ in a smoker... try it out!  It may not be as great as the smokey mt. but it really SMOKES

If you buy all three of these items individually from Amazon.com they cost $11.50 LESS than buying them in this set!

Other than that, I highly recomend these.  I grill several times a week and these have been put to good use with no complaints

The OXO line of cooking supplies is always a sure bet. If you want to look stylin' while you are out BBQ'in, this is a utensil set that won't let you down. The stainless steel was strong, and sturdy - it cut right through a  whole chicken and held it sturdy so I could transfer it from the BBQ to the  plate. Great set, I highly reccommend

I always recommend the OXO line of tools to anyone that does a lot of cooking and wants something really designed for use. This is especially true for anyone with problems such as tendonitis, arthritis, or carpal  tunnel -- these tools are all designed to leverage energy efficiently  instead of wasting energy as most poorly designed utensils. Try them out

I'm on my second Mr. Bar-B-Q wood brush and as long as they keep selling it at the value price, I imagine I will keep buying them. No, they don't last forever-- eventually the bristles will get clogged with a greasy sludge (how long that is depends on the frequency of use), but while it lasts, it does a fine job cleaning and scraping your grill. What sets it apart is the long handle and large head covered in brass bristles. While those bristles could stand to be a bit longer, they are still longer than many. The scraper side is quite strong and does not bend or break easily. You get a lot for your money with this solid product which could last several seasons

It's designed in Germany and mfgd in China. I'd say DEFINITELY locate and purchase the extension kit. I did. I have a large Guatemalan hammock that I've owned for years that's barely seen any use -- usually on camping trips. It finally occured to me to research and secure a hammock stand, and it's really delightful to be able to laze in the hammock in the shade of the house on summer afternoons. I wish I'd bought one of these years ago

After assembling the stand I was very pleased with my decision to purchase this one.  I also ordered an extension, thinking that for my Mayan family hammock I would need to make it longer.  But to my surprise, the hammock fit perfectly without the extension, and because the height of the stand can be adjusted pretty high, you could put a longer hammock in it because of this.  Very heavy steel, well enameled, excellent workmanship and very easy to assemble.  ***** - Definitely a five star purchase

I definitely need one in each room. We have one in each of the two bedrooms, the living room and the kitchen. The only room I still see roaches in is the bathroom. I guess I should get one for that room, as well... 

We definitely used to see big I'm-gonna-eat-your-baby roaches, and I haven't seen one since we put these in. However.... we were just moving in and had been ripping cabinets and flooring out, so they may have only surfaced due to our mild construction--which happened to end right about the time I put these in. 

Final verdict? Eh, circumstantial evidence says "they seem to work."

After college I moved back home for a few months before getting my own place. It was totally a sitcom setup in that I lived in my mom's basement - but the mice and spiders down there were not funny at all. I didn't really mind the mice running around every now and then, but when one got under the covers with me, I had enough. I went to a local brick & mortar store and bought all kinds of different traps, deterrents, etc to try to get them out or trap them without harming the critters (Mom wouldn't have it). I bought a single two-pack of these things and immediately after I plugged the first one in, I saw two mice immediately come out of their hiding spot and scurry to the unfinished part of the basement. Having one in my bedroom and one in the bathroom in the basement was enough for me, but Mom's husband was so impressed that he bought about a dozen more for the rest of the basement (lots of separate rooms) and the garage.

Definitely read the tips and suggestions - they will only work if there is a large, open space so put this in an outlet that has a "full view" of the room. Each room will need it's own, and a very large room (like a two-bay garage) will need two or three.

We put these up about three years ago and there hasn't been a mouse in the basement since

I recently moved into a house, and was seeing spiders and centipedes on a regular basis, so I decided to buy these to see if I could get rid of them.  I've been using these for about 3 weeks in various rooms of the house, and haven't seen a bug since.  I have to say that they really seem to be doing what they're supposed to.  I have used similar products like this in the past (not from Black and Decker), and have also found them to work, so I believe that this technology actually works well for getting rid of pests

This lounge/deck chair cushon is worth every peny. It is thick, comfortable (none of those deck chairs are comfortable without a substantial cushion), available in several color choices, and has a soft, not plasticky, cover fabric. You will have to measure the width of your deck chair carefully to see if it will fit. It just barely fit my 'titanic' deck chair because I had to scrunch it up a bit near the arms. But all turned out well and I must say I am very happy with it. It is a quality product and will keep you much more comfortable during your hours on the patio than those cheaper, but much thinner, types sold at outlet stores or supermarkets in summer. Get the best. This is it

This was a replacement clock for one that fell off the kitchen wall. I was very familiar with this clock since I had the original one for almost 3 years. I like the look of this clock and I like the choices you have for different displays. Overall this is a sweet clock. I did not however give this clock 5 stars because when you try and "program" this clock it won't do what you want it to do, not sure if it how the owners manual is written, or whether the manual is out of date with changes in how to adjust the features

I love this clock.  I won it as an incentive through my Creative Memories sales.  I love that it is always set to the accurate time.  My 4 and 6 year old love to tell me what time it is and at what phase of the moon it is presently (they always double check outside).  It's been a great addition to our home.

Once I got it didn't know where I was going to put the sensor since it isn't suppose to get wet. It took me awhile to get the outdoor sensor and thermometer to read. Once I got it working it seems to work well. Temp matches with in a degree or two to another thermometer. I put the sensor out on the upstairs patio in the late afternoon until I figured out where I would be able to put it. We had on unexpected rain that night and the thermometer no longer read.. I wished I had paid extra for a weather proof one. I took the batteries out and let the sensor dry out for a couple days, put it back together and it worked and has worked ever since. I didn't think the sensor would read from my upstairs back bedroom to the downstairs patio but it does

Like all cast iron cookware, not preseasoned, preseasoning is an absolute MUST. I use this product with the Bayou Classic Single Burner.It makes awsome eggs, bacon, and grilled cheese... whatever, with lots of space for cooking a bunch at once.

Great for camps, or just in the backyard for fun.

I ordered, two orders which equals four chairs.  The boxes are thick and double boxed. The chairs are placed, one inside the other . . . all wrapped with paper around the legs, arms and on top of the back. Fairly light weight and solid frame . . .  nothing to put together.  The color is a low luster pretty taupe color with tiny specks of silver . . . very expensive looking.  The cushions are a golden taupe color with an expensive weave pattern and piping around the edges, top and bottom for structure. It feels durable and water proof.  The back corners have velcro straps to hold the cushions in place.  They can be neatly stacked.  I'm extremely pleased with this order.  Thank you Amazon

If you have a problem seeing the time on your watch at night, then this is the answer.
The time projected on to the ceiling, is great.
Also, the alarm is unique as it starts slowly and then it starts to accelerate until you turn it off.

I gave one to my nephew for Christmas and he and everyone else has liked it so well that everybody in the family tried it out and I now have to order one for his mother and also one for my husband. 

The projection feature is great and the projection display is actually larger and brighter than I thought it would be. 

To be honest I have to mention the drawback - the display on the clock itself is so small and not backlit so you have to be pretty close to it to see the time during the day. 
Until someone puts a projection feature on a larger size CD/alarm clock, we will continue to keep our old alarm clock and put this one on the other side of the bed and use it mainly for the projection feature.

Even with the drawback mentioned, we all love the clock. My nephew loves being able to see what time it is without putting on his glasses

If you are the type that wakes up during the night and has to know the time, this is the clock for you. I absolutely love it. No glasses necessary, and I don't have to crane my neck to find the time. If you're a fanatic about exact time,(I'm not) the atomic feature means you're always on schedule.
I like this clock so much that I will be purchasing several as extra christmas gifts. Its a great fun item, too

This griddle is very useful, especially if you bring your grill to the camp site.  The surface cooks evenly and if sufficiently heated does a good job.  

At first I thought it was solid cast iron but upon further inspection found that it has some kind of high temperature coating.  My only criticism is that it isn't a more non-stick surface and food can be hard to clean off after use.

The gee whiz factor is great when you whip it out around other people who have the little stamped metal travel grills.  This item really rounds out the Baby Q's options.

I'm used to using a teflon coated electric griddle that has much more space than the Baby Q Griddle.  Cooking eggs and pancakes on the cast iron proved challenging and everything cooked much faster (too fast, at first).  The lack of a drain hole made cooking the bacon very greasy.  It got to the point where I had to remove the bacon, remove the griddle, dump the grease and continue cooking.  On the PLUS side the griddle fits perfectly and the included chrome handles make removing the griddle safe and effortless

Just got to use the Weber Baby Q griddle. It worked great. The only complaint I have is that it could be bigger. It covers just a little over half of the available grill area. More would be better.

Other than that, the design is excellent and it works great

Two days after buying this swing i found just the exact thing I was looking for and contacted Don, the seller, about a refund. Even though it was a Sunday, he got right back to me and said he'd make every effort to cancel the order, even though it ships direct from his supplier. He kept me informed every step of the way while he did what he could to cancel. By Tuesday, I got word that the order had been cancelled and that a full refund had been given. It was such a stress-free exchange. I would recommend this buyer for sure

If you are looking for this to be very accurate, then you need to use the lithium batteries.  Because of the cold temps here, the cheaper batteries do not work as well.  Maybe where it doesn't get in the minus temps, the Rayovac batteries will be okay, but not here in NE.  The sensor needs to be put in a location, that is out of the sun, and out of reach of your pets, and children.  Which makes for a little decision making time, on your part.

I ordered this sensor to go with a very old La Crosse Unit after the old sensor had been dropped I can't count how many time.  We never fixed it to a spot after three years of use and kept droping it off a brick wall three feet high bringing in the groceries etc.  It is extremely accurate as is the unit and even the forcasts are bang on.  I highly rate this product.

I've seen this in retail stores for 25% more, but never got around to buying one. I stumbled over it on Amazon, and couldn't beat the price. 

I cook a lot of salmon on my Weber Genesis, and have always had a difficult time keeping pieces of fish from sticking to the grill with my regular flipper.

This product solved my problem. It's the perfect size for a 1lb. filet, and the edge is tapered just enough that you can get under the fish without cutting in to it. No more jabbing at the fish to keep it intact, and no more balancing. 

Think about it... this is just a fish turner. And it's so good, someone's taking the time to review it.

We purchased this item from UJ's last August. Ordered it 1:00pm on a Monday; UPS truck in our driveway on Wednesday morning - no extra cost; just their standard shipping policy, and shipping was FREE. It took my husband less than 1hr to put together on our back deck. Everyone loves it. We've been using it ever since, and have not had to take it down (it's now February - in Pennsylvania - after 2 moderately bad snow and ice storms). We even used it for as the "bar" area for our Christmas dinner party. It was cold and sprinkling rain outside, and none of our guests got wet or had any complaint when stepping out to the "enclosed patio" to get their wine or spirit. We had enough sense to follow the suggestion and use the brackets that came with it to bolt it down to our deck. We've had 50-65 mph winds, with and without rain, and no problems.  I am now online ordering another one from UJ's for the side deck and addition to our home we will be building in the Spring. Thanks, Uncle Joe's for superior service and quality products!

This clock's display contains all the information necessary to prove that the time and date displayed are the actual time and date, assuming the clock is in the radio-controlled mode (that is, unless someone is willing to take extraordinary measures such as swamping-out the WWVB signal with an equivalent signal containing false data). 

According to the owner's manual, the presence of the antenna icon indicates that the clock is in the radio-controlled mode.  When this icon and the associated signal-strength bars are flashing, the clock is in the process of synchronizing to the NIST reference.  If either two or four signal-strength bars are displayed, there is sufficient signal for the clock to synchronize.  If no bars are displayed, it is not safe to assume that the clock is synchronized.

The display also contains a time-zone map of the US with the selected time zone darkened, and either "AM" or "PM" next to the antenna icon, thus eliminating two more reasons to question the displayed time.

Although the year is not explicitly displayed, it can be derived from the display when the user chooses to display the day of the week instead of seconds.

Like the other reviewer, I have this clock in my office - in my case in the middle of a warehouse.

Within 2 minutes the atomic clock had connected and set the time and date.  It has been in wireless contact ever since (there is an icon to let you know)

The time numerals are a little over 2" high and very clear - easy to read from 50' away.  The day, date and temp displays are about an inch tall and also very clear, but since they are so much smaller they don't have quite the distance visability.

It is nice to have a clock around that is always right - keeps my meetings on time - no arguement over whose watch is correct

I recently purchased an Orgeon Scientific JM889NA-S Jumbo Atomic Wall Clock with Indoor Temperature and have been delighted with it in every way. My main concern before it arrived was the brightness of the display. Well this unit far exceeds my expectations ... it is very bright and is visible from a great distance. A lot of LCD displays that I have seen on clocks, etc have been very dim and to me, very unsuitable.

Another feature that this unit has is automatic time updates and I found that it not only works, but works in my work place office. My office is an interior office (ie not located near any windows) and it is able to pickup the time signal through our building walls. This is amazing!!

I have also found the JM889NA-S to be very attractive looking and very well designed.

Five cheers for Oregon Scientific

We were so excited about getting this fire pit & rightly so... it's great & we couldn't ask for more! Adding wood is a breeze, it radiates heat well, was very easy to put together & so far hasn't shown any rust at all (although we do expect it to eventually)..

I bought this fireplace a few months ago and have enjoyed many a nice night drinking a martini and watching the fire.  This fireplace got me motivated to cut down the tree that died in my yard last year.  Half way through burning it!  Now for the unit.  It arrived nicely packed with all parts.  Installation was a snap, about 15 minutes.  There were dents in the screen, which is obviously part of the packing process. They are so small, though, that they cannot be seen unless someone is specifically looking for them.  The removable screens on the side are nice for adding more wood while the fire is still going.  Be sure to use mitts or tongs, however, or you will get burned.

We got this for my Dad for Father's Day.  I was not there for assembly, but heard that it went well.  It is so much nicer looking in person than in the ad pix.  A very nice little unit.  Dad did say that he might want to drill some holes in the bottom to get a better draft going.  But, all in all, we are thrilled with this product

Guys, this is a great purchase.  It's a quality unit and is bigger than it looks on the package.  Charbroil has done a fabulous job of making such a good little unit for such a good price.  Unless you're looking for something totally snazzy and are willing to spend a lot of money, don't pass this one up

Great buy

I ordered this on a friday and it was delivered the following weds. The base is heavy. The colors are very "in" now. A distressed Oil Rubbed Bronze pol and base with a taupe fabric.  Very nice. The umbrella opens and closes with a wind up handle. It is solid and put together well.  The fabric is thick and provides good shade on my SOUTH-SOUTHWEST facing rear lanai.  It was very easy to put together.  I am happy with my purchase of this set.  A++++++++++++++

We have a small back yard, this gazebo is just the right size for us.  The lighter effect and the 8X8 size doesn't  over power our garden.  Good quality and easy to follow instructions made it an afternoon project.

I bought these lounge chairs because of the other positive reviews I read on them.  I have to say that I am very happy with them too.  The color is a very nice antique color that matches the set we got a Costco a few years back.  I can't wait for those warm summer days and evenings to sit around the pool and enjoy lounging in these chairs.  They are not too heavy, so they will be easy to move around.  They are heavy enough that the the Santa Ana winds we have here in beautiful Southern California did not blow the chairs around at all.  I think the price for these is a very good price for the value and would recommend them.  I only wish you could pick your color for the material on the cushions.  The beige color matches what we have but is a little drab since our house and patio cover are the same color.  I see they sell replacement cushions in different colors, but it would be nice to have a choice in color when ordering the originals

I ordered 2 chaise and very happy with them. They are a little lighter in weight than I expected. Also, the image shows the metal a little lighter than what they are. The cushion looks beige in the photo and is actually more grey. Besides all that, they match very well with an Ethan Allen set that I have. Delivery was fine and they arrived sooner than expected

I wanted to mainly write this to address the shipping complaints below.  We are redoing our deck and expanding it, and after research thought this would be the best buy for a durable product.  After reading the shipping complaints, we put it on order right away- expecting to have it in the several weeks it would take for the deck.  Lo and behold- 3 days later they call my wife and ask to deliver it- any 4 hour window she wants- she picks the next morning and the next day when i get home there are 4 giant boxes in my garage spot when i get home.  They are huge boxes, and double boxed, but luckily no styrofoam- still i had to take all the cardboard to the recycling center myself, but at least very little was not recycleable.  Our deck is still not done, so i can make little comment other than that the one i did set up in the living room seems study- the cushion is very thick and well made- but stiff- which may be the comment noted below (I assume he goes for very soft).  I find it comfortable, but may comment more when we have actually used them a bit.  Still given the shipping concerns noted is several comments, I wanted to point out that if you have someone who can be home for a four hour window- it seems to be no problem.

I thought when I ordered these chaise lounges (2) they would only be temporary until I could afford "good ones" because they were so inexpensive.  Well these are good and I don't need to replace them.  The design actually matches my table set and I didn't even realize it until we unpacked them -- FULLY assemled!  I only have one complaint and it's really not that bad.  The thickness of the cushion seems fine for me but my skinny butt husband tells me the cushions aren't cushiony enough.  Other than that, the chaises are absolutely wonderful and good quality

This chaise lounge made for the perfect addition to my deck. The cushion is durable, thick and extremely comfortable, with velcro 'ties' to keep the cushion in place (from sliding). It truly is a beautiful piece. There was a slight mix-up with the shipping, but once everything was straightened out, the lounger was delivered just as scheduled. The delivery guys even brought the box around to my backyard and on to my deck. The chair comes completely assembled. All you do is open the box and enjoy

This chaise lounge really exceeded my expectations.  I'd shopped around and didn't want to spend $400 plus for a chaise lounge.  This is a great price plus you get free shipping.  They arrive completely assembled and well packaged.  Very attractive, sturdy, and most importantly, Very comfortable.  I highly recommend.  Got the side table with ice bucket and love it as well

This lounge chair (I bought two) exceeded my expectations for quality.  I've been shopping retail stores for months and can tell you that you can't beat this deal!  They are very sturdy and attractive.  
Don't be in a big hurry as they would have arrived quicker on the back of a snail.  You can't do better than free shipping but remember that you get what you pay for.  I made 3 seperate appts. with shipping company to deliver these items.  First there was a "miscommunication", second - "they had no record of the appt." third - they finally arrived but after their promised delivery time.  
Aside from the delivery frustrations I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend these for your backyard.  They look great on our pool deck

Lifetime has produced an extremely well made table. It is very sturdy. The top seem impervious to abuse. The legs are much more robust than any other I have seen. And they lock when folded, a really nice feature. Highly recommended

This little clock worked exceedingly well at first.  Clear, large display that was bright enough to read but not so bright it was distracting at night.  It takes up little space on a night table, which is great.

However, if it's on your night table you'll have to angle it so that the clock face is nearly toward the wall, as you can't adjust the projection.  If you face the clock out toward the far wall, the projection will be diplayed upside down.

Still, I was okay with this, as the projection was what I was interested in.  And that worked great until it accidentally got knocked off the nightstand onto the carpet.  One mishap and the projection was broken.  Nothing could fix it; you can't even open the clock to explore the mechanics of it.  Without the projection, it's simply a procey bed-side alarm clock.  It's my fault for knocking it over, but I would think a clokc of this caliber should be a bit sturdier

I love this clock because it has it all in a slick package for a good price.  The battery lasts forever, so it's portable, the time sets itself atomically, it shows the temperature, has the obligatory annoying alarm clock, the time lights up on the ceiling, and it looks good to boot.  Very well-made and highly recommended.  Oregon Scientific rocks

I recently purchased this clock and it's a great little clock! The time and temp are cool features as well as the projection which is very cool and useful. The projection (usually on the ceiling) is not too bright to hurt your eyes when sleeping or awakening.

The only problem with the projection is that unless you have the clock on the side the numbers project upside down. I mean to say that if you have it facing you straight ahead the numbers will be above the clock upside down. 

The atomic feature was a bit tricky also. I live in central NJ and when setting up the clock for the first time it didn't pick up any signal. After I searched for a signal, took the batteries out and tried everything I knew and everything the manual mentioned it wouldn't get a signal. So I had to write an email to the company and they sent me a response with several suggestions, the one that worked and was most useful was to search for a signal (by pressing the down arrow) and then while its searching place it where it can recieve full signal, which is shown by the meter on the left, like a cell phone. Once you get enough signal let it sit there until it sets itself (you may need to take it outside)...this can take from 10 mins to days. In my case it took about 5 mins. So it set the signal and the company says once it sets you can put it where you want and it will keep the signal. Other than that problem, which is fixed, the clock is hassle free and very easy to use.i highly recommend it. Oregon Scientific was also helpful and I sent them a thank you email stressing that they need to put more signal suggestions in the manual, because if they did I wouldn't have needed to bother email the customer service. Hopefully most people didn't give up that easily and kept trying to get the signal to set if they didn't they may have returned the clock needlessly.

The alarm is loud enough for me to awaken and the snooze button is useful and on the top so it's can be reached easily in a drowsy stupor.

Overall it's a cute, useful, and stylish clock.

Purchased this so my 7-year old can wake up on his own for school.  I checked several stores and was dissapointed to find nothing suitable for a child (didn't want radio, CD, telephone, and other features).

** Pros **
1. Very compact size, fits good next to bed
2. AC adapter with battery backup (even came with batteries)
3. LCD display doesn't have annoying illumination while trying to sleep.  Blue "glow" activates only when very easy to find button is pressed
4. Straight forward buttons and controls that took about 2-3 minutes for my 7-year old to learn.  Buttons are a good size and are not real hard to press.
5. Great styling as a kids clock
6. The projection feature is a BIG hit.  Projects about 4" high numbers on ceiling.
7. Projection intensity is good for laying in bed at night without lighting up the whole room
8. Decent construction for the $$$

** Cons **
1. None for my particular application
NOTE: If you are looking for a projection clock to use during the day (visible projection in sunlight), you will be extremely disappointed

I have had an oregon scientific clock for the last 7 years, finally had to replace it because of a soda spill.  I knew i wanted another Oregon Scientific clock and this was the best choice.  In fact this one works better then the old one (no long cord with a humongous antenna) I love the time on the ceiling feature.  Yes it only works when no sunlight is in the room but i dont sleep during the day. I highly recomend this product

For around $20. dollars you could save your life and the ones you love.
   This is super easy to use....both the transmitter & reciever run on batteries so there's no installation. I put mine on my back porch so when
I open the door to let my dogs out at night for a quick run nobody will
be there to surprise me. People who keep dogs for protection are fooling themselves. But these units are perfect. I've had mine for several days
and NOT once has it gone off for no reason....but it HAS sounded every time it should have. The range is even better then I expected. Only two things I'd change. Why the LED on the transmitter? I taped a dime over mine so it doesn't show. Why alert intruders they're being watched? And
it would be nice if the reciever could be plugged into an AC outlet to save on batteries. I have ordered a second one because this little device really gives me peace of mind

I admit it -- sometimes I just forgot to check to see if the cat wanted back in. The Driveway Patrol fixed all that. Setup about a foot or less off the ground in a relatively sheltered location by the front door, it does a great job of watching the front of the driveay and the front door. I originally set the sensor up to look down the entire length of the drive but it proved much too sensitive for this to be useful so I aimed the sensor low ACROSS the driveway near the front door and this has worked out fine. It now tells me when the cat is ready to come in as well as when a pizza or package delivery has arrived. 

The Driveway Patrol actually saved me quite a bit of trouble one day when I had been waiting the entire afternoon for the cable guy -- he eventually showed up late, didn't even bother to knock or ring the bell and only stayed just long enough to leave a note telling me I wasn't home. Due to the Drveway Patrol, I managed to wave him down at the end of the drive. This alone made the gadget worth the price.

As I've said, the Driveway Patrol does exactly what I need it to do. The only false alarms I get are from visiting neighbor cats, racoons and the odd bird. The only things I would change about the gadget would be to add a volume control that had more settings than 'loud' and 'very loud' and the fact that the chimes will ring continuously while being triggered and then for another 10-15 seconds beyond that

If you take the time to "tune" the placement of the sensor, this works great!  I don't know if the people who complain about these got defective units or have a lot of animals or something setting them off, but I have several of these set up to form a perimeter around the house and they work great.  We do have cats around here, a whole bunch of them, but the trick of putting the sensors in a birdhouse worked great, and I haven't had any false alarms since doing so.  The sensors have been out in the hot Florida sun, cold nights (well, for Florida, down to about 26), torrential rain, and still work great.  It didn't take too much time to set them up and test them, either.  These are definitely a lower-cost way to set up a security system so that you'll know if anyone enters your yard

UPDATE OF MY REVIEW DUE TO JULY 2006 HEAT WAVE: I have two of these low-cost alarms set up, and both become quite intermittent when the temperature reaches 90 degrees and above (in the shade): Sometimes they go off when a person/car goes past, and sometimes they do not. As soon as the temperature decreases though, they become much more reliable. I WOULD NOT RECOMENDED THESE DEVICES FOR SECTIONS OF THE COUNTRY WITH HOT WEATHER, SUCH AS ARIZONA, TEXAS, NEW MEXICO, ETC. Original review: I am very impressed with this alarm: It is accurately able to detect people coming up the stairs of my apartment, and sets off the indoor alarm -- and it has not sent out any false alarms (Most problems with this alarm (that I have read in the reviews below) appear to be caused by the sensor being in direct sun light. This seems to cause these units numerous difficulties, and should have been addressed in the Patrol Sensor's enclosed instructions -- but isn't. However, by simply shielding the outdoor sensor from all *direct* contact with the light of the sun by using tape or opaque plastic, or repositioning the outdoor sensor, appears to eliminate false alarms or no alarms). This alarm unit appears to be quite well made, and the price is, of course, incredibly low. Great buy!!

This grill cover is much nicer than the Weber standard cover.  I have the 18 1/2" and can't imagine that the 22 1/2" is much different.  What I really like is the elastic pieces sown to the bottom that keep it on snuggly even when a little wind is blowing.  

Again, it looks nice, all black, stitching virtually invisible, and a nice Weber logo.

After a couple nights left in the rain, the grill shows zero signs of being out in the weather

Well, look no further.  My apartment complex doesn't allow any type of charcol or gas grills but electric is allowed.  I was going crazy trying to find one that would fit my George Forman Kettle Grill - I didn't want to lug it in and out all summer.  So, I took a gamble and ordered this grill cover and it fits perfectly! I can now leave my George Forman Kettle Grill on my deck and not have to worry about the elements

This shelter met all my expectations.  I would tell anyone to get the optional sand bags if you do not plan to use spikes to secure it.  Being so large, it catches quite a bit of wind and would surely tip over otherwise.  I had mine setup on a raised deck, so the sandbags were a life saver!  Overall this is a high quality item and has already been used a few times and is a much more economical option to renting party tents!  The storage bag is outstanding too... with nice wheels and a handle - it is easy to transport!  The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because it is a little challenging to setup because it is so large

This is a great little table! I'm able to stand at the table and cut fabric for a sewing project. Then, adjust the height and the kids can sit at the table and paint or craft. I am very pleased with this purchase!

I just received this table, and I can already tell that it will be a great asset for my scrapbooking.  The table is adjustable in height, so no matter where I am scrapbooking, I can adjust the height to fit the chair I am sitting in. The table is light enough for me to move by myself, and will fold up for easy storage.  The table is also sturdy enough to use paper punches and eyelet setters.  I'm thinking of purchasing another, so I can spread out even more!

I agree completely with the other reviewer: well packaged, easy to put together, very sturdy. Way better quality than those you see at outdoor concept stores.  I mainly ordered it b/c I knew it would be the right size to go w/the Strathwood chaise lounges I ordered; I am very happy with it.

The table arrived within a few days and well packed.
It was easy to put together, took me about 10 minutes.  One of the best instructions and labeling of parts I have ever seen, even a little bottle with paint for touch ups.
The table is just like described and is of good quality.  It has a bronze/brown finish and looks great with the Strathwood deep-seating chairs I ordered earlier. Definetly would buy this again

I've had this wireles temperature station for about 2 months now and I'm very happy with it.  I mounted the wireless sensor in my outdoor screened porch to both keep it dry and out of the direct sunlight (direct sunlight would likely result in innacurately high readings).  The "base" station is usually in our kitchen, but for a while I moved it around different rooms of our house to see how much the indoor temperature varies from room to room - the outdoor sensor never "lost contact" with the base.  The indoor temp reading is accurate and is within 1-2 degrees of 2 thermostats I have in the house, and the outdoor temp is accurate with 1-2 degrees of an outdoor mounted thermometer that is also in the screened porch.  I enjoy the convenience of quickly and easily knowing what the outdoor temp is in the morning.

This product works as advertised and I'm very happy with it.  Enjoy

This is the second temperature station I have purchsed. Both work well but differ in small points. The instructions might be clearer. Getting back from using max/min iis not easy.
I have not used the station in below freezing weather so I am curious to see if the batteries will work at -10

Put a few racks or ribs and a full chicken in the smoker on the first use and everything came out great.  With the LP gas, it was easy to maintain a pretty steady temperature and the large chip box made great smoke for a long period.      Great barbecue with very little effort

There are probably more authentic ways to make real BBQ, but nothing any easier.  If what you like about BBQ is the flavor, not the work, this unit is for you.  Add water to the pan, chips to holder, put some dry rubbed pork [...] on one (or all) of the four grates, light the gas and you are good to go.  It holds temperature very well unattended.  Adding more chips two additional times gives you all the smoke flavor you could want.  Your friends will think you are a genius

When I decided to purchase a Weber kettle, I knew that a side table was required. Several reviews have spoken about the  table splitting.  I ordered mine from my local hardware store and when I picked it up, I asked about finishing it.  The hardware folks (and this is a really good store) gave me a gloss polyurethane finish and very fine sandpaper to prep my work table.  Bottom line: take some time and finish this product.  Your local hardware folks will guide you satisfactorily.

We had out of town guests arriving when our puppy had chewed our chaise lounge to shreds.  We ordered this chaise lounge cushion and it was sent to us immediatly, w/o special instructions to do so.  When we received it, it was a bit thinner than I wanted, but for the price and fast delivery, it was great!!!  The material is durable and of good quality.  Our kids have been laying on it with swimming pool water dripping off them and it's been out in the weather for 4 weeks and shows no wear.  Like I said, it's a bit thinner than I wanted, but a good buy

They are handsome and nicer than I expected, by far.  The fabric has a really nice quality -- strong, pleasantly textured, durable, and a fine rich color.  They're handsome, well-stitched and sturdy, very comfortable, and are holding up to the sun -- some rain too, I must admit.  These were a terrific deal ..

Nice cushions that dry out pretty fast.  Seem durable.  They also seem high quality.  The only thing is they are more of a tan color-- the picture shows them as white which is what I really wanted.  But they are nice.  Could use a strap at the top also so the wind doesn't constantly blow them over

After reading these other reviews, I decided to wait a while to post a review.  I bought two of these chairs summer 04 and they are doing great.  Relatively easy to put together and really sturdy.  They are still looking good with no issues with fading or anything.  My wife would make me get rid of these if there was any issue or problem with them at all.  I hope she doesn't read this

I bought two of these sets, along with the table and wow - i get so many compliments - they are beautiful on my new front porch.  I was skeptic at first because of the price, but they are worth every penny and a few hundred dollars more.

I purchased 2 of these and couldn't be more pleased. Like another reviewer, I gave 4 stars only becuase I've only had them for a few days and don't know how they'll weather. They arrive mostly assembled, and took only about 20 minutes to assemble each set. They look great, and are a comfy place to spend an afternoon.

Not as huge and heavy as the ones we used to make, but they're solid, and much easier to move

I've had these chairs for about a week (I bought two) and they look fabulous on my front porch. They are comfortable too.

My expectations were exceeded.

Like another reviewer, I too searched for Adirondack chairs and
found the prices to be ridiculously high. This chair and ottoman
for $84.99 ($10 shipping) is a steal!!

The quality and construction seem to far outweigh the price.

I only gave 4 stars because I can't comment on the durability and maintenance after only a week. Strathwood recommends Teak Oil a couple of times a year.

I also purchased the 30" folding table to place in between the chairs - what a set !!!

If you're thinking about this chair, don't hesitate, you will not be disappointed !

If you are searching for Adirondack chairs, like I did a few weeks ago, you will find a wide array of prices--too ridiculous to mention.  This strathwood for 79.99 and 10 for shipping is a STEAL!  I have not been able to find them cheaper anywhere!

You get the chair and the foot stool which is why I rated it 4 stars.  The quality is decent, I think for the price you get what you pay for and a bit more.  The kit comes almost constructed--you have do the final screws.

The chair comes pre oiled, however I highly recommend oiling it again, if you want the color to last.  I also recommend Teaqua, do not use conventional Teak oil.  I do agree with the previous reviewer that if you sit in the chair for an hour it can get uncomfortable, however I purchased cushions for it, and sitting for an hour has not been a problem.

The construciton is sturdy, they have been sitting on my deck for about a month now and all is well.

On a gusty day when I saw the chessy plastic thermometer I gave my wife for Mother's Day shattered on the back deck, I decided it was about time to replace it with something decent. I did my home work on the internet and found that La Crosse made good quality unit at a reasonable price. After opening the box when my WS-8025 arrived and reading over the instructions, I had it up and running in under 20 minutes. The WS-8025 allows you to adjust the barometer to local conditions (which you can get on line from your local schools).
    I've had it up a running for two weeks and find that the WS8025 does a good job of forecasting the weather. The atomic clock took a day to link up (which they tell you in the manual it might) but has stayed linked up since.
    I purchased the optional TX3UP with remote probe that I have in my fish pond. So besides seeing the outside temerature and humidity, I can keep an eye on the pond. You can set the WS-8025 to alarm at any high and low temperatures that you chose. (Which came in handy the other night when the pond heater failed).
     So far I'm happy with my purchase and I like the way the LaCrosse WS-8025OAK looks on the wall.

My family and I are quite happy with this hammock. It is comfortable and sturdy. Since it doesn't come with the hanging hardware, future buyers make sure to order it from amazon at the same time ("HAMMOCK KIT - SCREWS" by  American Science & Surplus). Otherwise you might find yourself on a long search. The only other place where we came across it was Wal Mart

I ordered this for my dad for christmas. I was worried that it wouldn't fit him because he is a large man, but thought what the heck I'll use it if he can't. I opened the box and I wasn't sure it looked like a sack of ropes. Then I began unfolding, and unfolding, and unfolding and before long the thing was stretched at least 14 feet across my kitchen. The loops are just great and seem so strong. The only drawback was its not very soft but i guess it wouldn't be all that sturdy made out of chenille would it. Now all I need to do is buy him a home depot giftcard so he can get so sturdy posts and hardware and he is set!!

This clock is great for people who sleep on their backs. If you happen to be lying on your stomach though, you have to turn over to see the time on the ceiling or reach over to the clock and press the snooze button to briefly turn on the clock light. I wish the clock itself had a lighted time display. Also we have 11 foot ceilings so the display is a little dim. 

The snooze button is on top. It is big and easy to press but the button to turn the alarm off is small and on the front below the display. You have and grab the clock in an awkward way and hold the button down for a second to turn the alarm off.

The clock automatically set the time. I was impressed with this as we live near the bottom of an apartment building surrounded by other tall buildings with no clear view of the sky.

After much research and reading lots of reviews, we chose this Weber. It is more expensive than others in its category but the high reviews and our past experience with Weber and the warranty helped us make this our choice. We love it so far. We live on top of a hill and one of our concerns was the wind. Well the grill performs superbly! Even on a cold (40 degrees) and windy day, it heated up in less than 10 mintues.

After extensive research and despite less-than-exptected Consumer Reports ratings, I chose to purchase the 2007 Weber Summit S-450 grill.  I own a 5-year-old Charbroil that is bowing out and losing heat/smoke when I cook so I wanted a multi-fuctional grill to replace it that would last longer.  The Summit S-450 includes a beautiful smoker box with a dedicated burner and a Rotisserie Kit.  More importantly, it is a Weber, which means great warranty and customer service and built to last.

When I opened the item with my friends we all salivated at the heavy-duty construction of this grill.  The impressive stainless steel was high-grade and the grill was very heavy.  No wobbling.  It was very easy to set up and took about one hour.  Let me say that although I expected this grill to be better than my old, I never thought it would be so impressive in all aspects.  Weber thinks about everything when they make a grill.  From the heavy gauge stainless steel grates to the high-end burners this grill really catches your eye.  Having researched the grills at all the local hardware and big box stores, I can honestly say this grill beat them all with just looks and materials alone.  That was even before I attached the propane and lit the thing!

When I did test the burners I was extremely impressed with the ignition system.  I've never seen anything like it and all burners, including rotisserie and side lit on the first try.  The grill got up to heat very quickly and the eveness of the heat was evident buy looks and using a hand test over the grates.  While I only cooked a hamburger for my first meal, I was pleasantly surprised by the beautiful grill marks the grates left.

I do a lot of slow-cooking and smoking and the thermometer, smoker box, and seal of the grill will certainly improve my grilling of carolina pulled pork and briskett.  Further, the knobs/temperature controls seem to offer infinite heating options.  I cannot wait to experiment and learn with this grill as I add items to my menu.

While I just got this grill yesterday, I am more than hopeful of the quality and craftmanship and truly believe it will last triple the amount of my Charbroil.  I'll have to add to this review as I continue to use this wonderful grill

I got my Grill to Go Advantage just recently and have been very pleased so far.  The makers of the Grill 2 Go appear to have heard some of the criticisms of earlier models and taken that into consideration with this grill.  The open flame cooking is preferable to the previous models, it is still easy to transport, and it has made tailgating with friends before watching my Tarheels play basketball a lot of fun.  I completely disagree with the other reviewer who seems to be reviewing the wrong product since this grill does not use a non-stick cooking surface for the cooking area

Another gadget I had to have.  For the price, this is a really neat outdoor thermometer that shows the high and low temperature of the day.  One important note is the location of installation.  I live in S.Fla and mounted it on the north facing window.  You must locate it in a spot where direct or even somewhat direct sunlight does not affect it as this will most likely give false readings.  If you have a glass door or window that leads to a screen enclosure, this would also allow for a fairly correct temperature reading, although this could also cause improper readings in the heat of the day as the metal pan roof can reflect heat to the inside of the screen enclosure.
All in all, I love mine and reccomend it. I bought 10 of them at Christmas and gave them out as gifts

Vinyl is vinyl, right?  Wrong.  This grill cover has some heft to it; the thickness and feel of it are lightyears ahead of the cheap, discount store cover that lasted less than one summer.  Now entering its third winter in North Dakota and no cracks, rips, or flaws.  Worth every penny

Finally - a grill cover that actually stays on the grill and protects it in the worst weather.  The velcro straps keep it secure but it is very easy to remove when ready to use the grill.  This has to be the 4th or 5th grill cover we've tried and it will be the last one we try.  I would recommend this product to anyone investing iin a grill.  Why not spend a couple bucks more so that your $400 grill doesn't rust out in two seasons

This is a quality heavy duty grill cover.  When you pay good money for a Weber Grill you want it to stay looking good.  Don't go buy one of those cheap Walmart covers for $10.  It will not last and you will end up buying another one in a year or two.  This cover wasnt cheap, but by the looks of it...it should last a long time

Eating the chicken that this roaster produced was almost a spiritual experience! I had it for a month or so before I remembered to buy a whole bird and defrost it to use. Then I realized I didn't really have any beer on hand or anything, but the chicken had to be cooked, so I used what I had. I'm hear to tell you that putting a little Jack Daniels in the well (I don't drink it, I only cook with it) along with a little water and some tequila lime vinegar and then sprinkling the bird with cajun seasoning still produced an amazingly moist and flavorful chicken. I was astounded - it took about an hour to cook and the bird was juicy, tender and flavorful with a nice crispy skin. Do not walk, RUN to buy this thing. It's worth every penny and you're not getting weird chemicals from an actual beer can (with it's label etc) in your chicken, and as I just proved, the sky is the limit as to what you put in the resevoir. yum!!

I bought two of these Weber Roasters because they make the process of roasting chicken so easy. No can and a nonstick surface make removing the cooked chicken so much easier and clean up is a cinch. Also because these roasters retain the juices in the pan, the inside of my BBQ is much cleaner and I don't have to clean it after every chicken I cook

This item is great.  It keeps my chicken upright, there is no beer can to dispose of after the chicken is cooked, no grease gets in my grill, it holds the chicken while I carve it, and it cleans up super easy.  I have recommended this product to friends and family

We already had 2. This was a gift for my father. Easy to make, easy to clean, does not make a mess on the bbq like other poultry roasters. The pan underneath catches all of the drippings. The secret "cap" keeps all of the moisture in. The only way for the liquid to escape is through the chicken. Therefore, very moist

My family and I love "beer can" chicken but I didn't like the idea of literally putting my food onto a beer can.  This Weber Poultry Roaster is so much cleaner and far easier than using a beer can.  The chicken remains stable too...no more trying to balance the chicken on a beer can.  And it's a great way to switch from using beer to using wine.  What a fabulous product

Very easy to use.  Simply fill the aluminum cup in the tray with beer, wine, fruit juice, or some other beverage. For extra flavor, add spice as well.  Place the infusion cone on top of the cup, then place the chicken on top of the infusion cone.  Once the chicken is in place, put the infusion cap on top to lock in the steam.  Steam cooks the chicken on the inside, heat on the outside.  Chicken is tender and juicy on the inside while the skin is cooked to a golden, crispy brown.  Fat and grease drain away from the chicken and collect in the bottom of the roaster instead of the grill.

To remove cooked chicken from roaster:  Remove the infusion cap.  Next, take a pair of tongs and go down the back side of the chicken and slide it off the infusion cone.  This is easy to do since the roaster is nonstick.  If your chicken is heavy, you may need to support it with a second set of tongs

If you've ever made Beer Can Chicken then you know what a problem it is sometimes to get the chicken to sit properly on the grill with only a beer can for support. 

The Weber Poultry Roaster solves this problem, and goes several steps further to result in a moist, tender and absolutely delicious chicken. This item gets 5 stars and two thumbs up!!

The pan has a well in the center to hold the beer. This by the way uses less liquid than traditional Beer Can Chicken, which leaves more of the golden nector for other purposes such as drinking for those who prefer to do so. The medieval torture looking prong device sits over the beer well and the chicken in turn sits on this. Weber includes a round cap that fits on the top of the chicken to help seal in the moisturizing juices. The pan then sits in the grill and collects the chicken drippings, thus keeping the grill cleaner. The chicken sits very securely in this pan with no chance of opening the grill to find it had fallen over.

The non-stick coated surfaces make this roaster pretty easy to clean up, especially for something that's been sitting in the grill for an hour or so.

We've used this roaster several times, and are still just as thrilled with it as we were on day 1. The chicken always comes out so moist, tender and flavorful it's hard to believe it was grilled! 

I highly recommend this roaster, in fact I've even given them as gifts.

For reference, "old tanks" will refer in this review to Weber "quick connect tanks."

First about the price:  I got this at Home Depot for $16.95 because I needed to grill in a hurry.  If you do not have an OPD tank for your Weber grill and can see yourself in the future refilling, and you would receive it in time before you run out, then I would recommend getting it on Amazon for the lesser price but can afford shipping time.  

If you have an older Weber grill and wanted the tank to be refilled, then you probably understand the frustration that I had to go through to get more propane.  Federal Law has mandated that all tanks now be "OPD" certified.  Now, on these OPD tanks, which can be detected by the "star" shape of the handle, has a different opening where the hose on your grill needs to be connected as compared to the older model.  So when I went to have it refilled, they told me that they could no longer refill my old model.  So I bought a Blue Rhino.  Then, I could not connect it to my Weber grill because of the different opening.  (The propane hose would not adapt to the tank.)  So I now had three options.  One was buy a new grill, which would be quite expensive.  Second, which Weber recommended, probably because it would cost me more money, would be buying a new hose.  (They said it was around $40.  And I have also heard that it has a problem with squirrels eating it.) And third was this adapter that I found.  Thus, this adapter was the answer for the price.  Connect the thread side of the adapter and your hose to the other side of the adapter (This is the "spring side" or "quick connect" side where to release the hose from the adapter, you must just pull back on the end part of the adapter.)

A picture of the adapter with the the new tank and old hose can be found here:
http://www.homedepot.com/cmc_upload/HDUS/EN_US/asset/images/eplus/161203_3.jpg

I also have some advice on using the product to which I hope you may find useful.  (The installation instructions were quite weak with the product.) When installing, there is a black plastic piece which is used to screw in the adapter to the part.  Be careful when using your crescent wrench not to break off the part.  If you break the plastic piece, you probably will be unable to take off the adapter from the tank in the future.  Therefore, I would also recommend placing the piece in a safe place so when you need to refill, it will be handy to take off the adapter.  However, if you lose the piece, or break it, there is one more way to have it refilled.  There is an adapter which was placed on the old tanks for refilling.  And since this product basically converts your new tank into the old one, then you can place this refilling adapter on the product.  I know it can be confusing in words, but basically what I am saying is that you will have adapter on adapter when refilling the tank.  Your refill store will most likely have this second adapter for you when you go in to refill.  (I get mine a Pool-Mart and they usually have this handy.)  But just to be on the safe side, I would keep that plastic piece.  But back to installation:  When you finished screwing it in, just connect your hose to the other side by pulling back on the only part of the adapter that moves, and once you push the hose end into the adapter, push back up the only part of the adapter that moves to lock the hose in place.  And to remove the hose, simply pull back on the sliding adapter piece - the only part that moves.  But most likely you didn't need that as you have refilled your old grill sometime in the last several years.  But just in case you may have needed it.

And on performance, there are no leaks, as shown with the soap and water test.  Just pure gas grilling is all I have now until another law is passed.  But until then, I recommend two things:  First is buying this adapter, and second is using common sense to install it, not the instructions.  Happy grilling, and thanks for reading

Using this procuct makes changing propane tanks a really quick procedure.  Just remember to pull the outer ring back before installing the male part.  Additional items need to be offered if you are not just ordering an extra one for your Weber grill.  1)  An adapter for the propane retailer to fill your tank.  2)  The male portion of this quick connect adapter so that other propane appliances can be attached to your tank.  It doesn't look like it is included as offered.  The quick connect adapter by itself won't do you any good

It took a long while to get this one, but it is entirely worth the wait. This hammock is wide/long and gets a high score for comfort. One thing I didn't know was that the hanging kit (hooks/chains) for this hammock has to be purchased separately (costs about $15). Despite that, I have to say that it is a great buy for its price

I got this last year from Amazon.com during one of their bundle specials with the hammock stand.  It's a nice hammock and comfortable for the most part. My only complaint is that the ropes are too elastic.  While it's very relaxing and conforms to your body, after about 30 minutes of laying or sitting on it, you have to get up and retension the hammock to keep your body from dragging along the ground (I'm a lightweight at about 135 lbs).  It's possible that I need to break it in more since I've only used it about 10 times, but right now it kind of annoying that I can't just relax without worrying about feeling the ground beneath me

I purchased this item for the offic gift exchange.  The golfers went crazy for it.  We have the kind of exchange where you can "steal" someone else's gift and this bbq set really made the rounds!  Nice quality and is bigger than it looks in the picture

I did a lot of searching and review reading on the internet before finally deciding what to buy. I am convinced Quick Draw II is THE best value available of any make by any conpany. The features on the QDII are generally found only on much higher priced detectors. This thing really works as advertised. I have already found several coins and other things right in my own yard. It will reliably indicate what coin is being detected although it many times confuses dimes and pennies on the LCD readout. It is very sensitive and detects most coin size items very reliably to about 6 or 8 inches. The auto notch discrimination works well and filters out most trash items. I have used metal detectors that ended up being aggravating and frustrating. This one is a pleasure to use and is quickly becoming a relaxing and profitable pastime for me. If you want a serious metal detector without spending a whole lot of money give it a try... you won't be disappointed..

I have been wanting to try Beer Can Chicken for awhile and my parents just happen to have one of these from a impulse purchase awhile back unused. So I got a chicken, got some rub, popped open a cold one and went to work.  The stand is a much more stable way of cooking the chicken than just having the can hold up the way. The result was one of the most moist chickens I have ever eaten! I recommend this

This rack works so much better than trying to balance the chicken on the grill using just the can and the legs.  Now someone has to figure out how to get the chicken off the can after it is cooked.

Been using the weather station for a few months now and am pretty satisfied with it.  Temperatures agree okay, and humidity is within the accuracy specified by LaCrosse.  The display is a bit busy, so I occasionally have trouble finding the information I want quickly.

Our old General Electric indoor/outdoor thermometer's outdoor sensor broke this summer, so it was time to replace it with a weather station that could give more info about the weather than just the temp.  I live in South Florida, and it's nice to know what the heat index is, because in the summer, our temps along the coast rarely rise above 90 degrees, but the heat index rarely is below 100 (in which case I choose the indoor treadmill over running outside).

I bought this unit on the strength of prior reviews, which I think are pretty darn accurate in their overall assessment.  I can't present much new information here, but I will validate some of the prior comments.

The weather station is constructed of cheap plastic.  I think if this station falls off our kitchen bar, where it rests today, it will break into smithereens.  It'll be best hung from a nail on a wall or put in a location where it's not going to fall to the ground -- ever.

The weather station has a clumsy vertical design with a small base so I think it'd be pretty easy to bump into it and knock it over.  The same advice in the above paragraph applies here, too.

The weather station does emit a high-pitched tone when you press a button to backlight the display for a few seconds.  It's not a big deal to me, but some might find that annoying.

The weather station does have a clutzy, non-intuitive method of setting the display which really does call for pressing the Set button up to 11 times!  Each depression of the Set button selects one area of the display to be set, and there are a lot of settings being displayed (time, day, date, etc.).

It was pretty easy to spend a moment setting the weather station (despite the clutzy interface), and because I live in the Eastern time zone, my job was made easier because the default setting is for the Eastern time zone.  The clock automatically synchronized with some atomic clock somewhere, so that part worked just fine.

As for accuracy, well, I've had it only a few days now, but it seems to be working alright.  We've had rain for the last few days, and the barometric display -- which only shows clouds/rain, partly sunny, and sunny -- accurately forecasted the cold front by the drop in air pressure.  When I put the outdoor sensor next to the indoor sensor (inside my house), the readings were within a few tenths of a degree from each other.  The humidity readings were exactly the same.

The weather station reads between .3 and .7 degrees warmer than my old indoor/outdoor thermometer.  I wouldn't know which of the two digital displays is accurate -- my old thermometer or this new weather station.  The weather station does seem a lot more jumpy when it comes to reading the indoor temp.  It's quick (when compared to my old indoor thermometer) to change the reading when, say, the air conditioning turns on.

Having the lunar phase display is a nice touch.

Overall, I like this unit so far.  I wish it were constructed of more durable plastic -- my old GE indoor/outdoor unit is built to be thrown against a wall without being damaged -- and I think I'd prefer a thermometer reading that wasn't quick so jumpy with temperature fluctuations.  I like the humidity readings for both indoor and outdoor, and I especially like the heat index calculation.

In all, I would recommmend this weather station to other buyers

I'm very happy with this product. Setup was straightforward and the sensor measurements seem to be consistently accurate. I think it was a good value. I particularly like the outdoor humidity and dew point LCD displays on the body of the outside module, in addition to the remote display of the information indoors. It is also handy that the remote display shows local time referenced to NIST's WWV

We own a home with vaulted ceilings and we have tried everything to keep the house clean (cobwebs, ceiling fans, windows,etc.) that are out of reach.  We found this product online and it works great.  Our kids even enjoy using it around the house.  Each attachment is perfect for the task at hand.  I wish we bought it five years ago.

This is a great cleaning system for anyone with high walls or vaulted ceilings.  Plus, all the attachments make cleaning very versatile.  I looked at a similar system listed in the Frontgate catalog -- and almost purchased it for more than $120.00.  Then I found this -- for less than $40.00.  It's great -- and I recommend it to anyone who likes to stay cobweb & dust free

I was able to reach the top of the windows in my two story foyer with this wonderful product. I need to point out I am 5'4".  I did need the assistance from my boyfriend (who is 6'1") to reach the ceiling to remove the cobwebs...but he did it and they are GONE!  
I just received my Simple Clean today and I have already tried three attachments. The ceiling fan attachment worked well. I used the duster to dust my window panes in my foyer as well as my fragile lighting. LOVED IT! We also used the spider web remover and it was great! I recommend this product to everyone!

The Companion Group works to create new and innovative barbecue accessories that exceed expectations.  Being the first to produce the compartmentalized grill basket means we have a learning curve to balance out before attaining perfection.  We have identified improvements including a simple insertion mechanism for the detachable handle, and have stream lined the compartment lids for easy opening and shutting.  These adjustments have made for superior functionality making this a product we are proud to call part of the Steven Raichlen line.  We sincerely apologize and would encourage anyone who received the unsatisfactory product to call our customer service manager (800-521-0505, ext 3512) and we will replace the item at no additional charge.

This is my first charcoal grill and I will say, I bought it because of Weber's reputation for so many years as THE best charcoal grill. As mentioned, it isn't very big for indirect cooking. I cook for just my wife and me and it's fine but too small for cooking for guests. If I could do it over again, I'd buy the 22 1/2" grill because of it's larger cooking area and ability to add the rotisserie attachment. I'm not a big rotisserie guy but the extention is needed to cook Beer Can Chicken, something I have always loved to cook on gas grills.

The Good: Simple and easy to put together. Works as perfect as you would expect. Cleaning is as easy as using a brass brush occasionally. This little grill is a powerhouse, cooking most items in less than 5 minutes. Webber has world class customer service. 

The Bad: The grill works perfect right out of the box (put it together yourself) however, this is where the problem lies...the box. Whoever Webber got for their packaging really screwed up. They put the legs on the outside of the main grill container, as a result, the legs came smashed and the plastic that holds the small parts is stapled once allowing for most parts to slip through and out of the box. My grill came smashed, dented, and missing parts. I ordered a replacement directly from Webber which they sent me an entire grill at no charge without needing to send the smashed one back. It also came smashed. Instead of calling again, I used parts from both grills to make one that was not smashed up.

Choosing our first grill really was a simple decision. We knew we wanted something quality and that would last us for a while. Weber was the only way to go in our minds. Now that we own this grill I can honestly say that hardly a day goes by that we don't use it!

I'm really glad that we opted for the one touch rather than the smokey joe by the same manufacturer. This grill has a hook inside the cover to hang on the side and ash clean up is very easy. And for the two of us, this grill is enough to keep us or even guests well entertained. Highly recommended

You can't go wrong here, took just 20 minutes and I have 10 thumbs, all you need is a hammer and look at the pictures that come in the book.  For taste, you can't tell that even I, who can and does burn water, can cook mouth watering burgers and steaks that my family duplicates in their high priced, propane lugging grills. Same recipe-charcoal and light it without the propane burn.  One just need to be very generous with the non-stick spray or else your food sticks and breaks up on the grill.  Also the Kingford fast start charcoal is a marvel, if you cook just several burgers and a steak, because after about 20 minutes the charcoal burns out. Lastly, the bottom vent is quite cheesy, so for the grilling I did not open it and grilled with the top off, with no fear of hot ashes whipping around the yard

I purchased this to monitor my attic and crawl space temperature prior to installation of additional attic ventilation vents and insulation.  3-channel readings are accurate to within 0.5 deg F.  Sometimes, we lose the signal, but it reacquires it relatively easily.  Min/max temperature memory is a nice feature

I can easily read the display 7-8 feet away in dim light. 

The base unit receives its signal from the remote that I placed on the north side of the house on a shaded porch. In between are 4 walls since the two units are located diagonally across my house. Absolutely no problems with reception.

I purchased an additional remote (THR138). When I place the base and two remotes side by side at room temperature and let them stabilize for about 15 minutes, all three agree within 0.3 degrees Farenheit.

Read the manual! Add batteries to the remote(s) first, press the reset button(s) with something non-conductive (a toothpick), and THEN add batteries to the base unit.

I live in a cold climate. While I haven't experienced sub-zero temps since purchasing this unit, my other Oregon Scientific wireless thermometer, an RAR232, has worked just fine with alkaline batteries at -16F this season.

Excellent value

I have bought two of these units; one for Seattle and one for a condo in Southern California and they've both worked well.
The Seattle unit is constantly wet (like the city and its residents) and the Palm Springs unit has no problem with temperatures well above 100 degrees at times. Neither one has failed yet.
It is a pain to change the batteries. You'll need the world's smallest screwdriver to remove the screws that allow you to get inside the unit to change the batteries. And the cheap metal bracket that allows the remote unit to stand up outside? You'll lose that within a week

I put the sensor out my backdoor in a shady area about 30 feet from the main unit in the kitchen.  One screw attaches each item.  It has three channels.  It'll memorize the high and low indoor and outdoor temperature.

The display is large enough to read from several feet away.  It's been installed for several months of silent, dependable, and accurate temperature monitoring.

This is a great umbrella - the quality is excellent for the price, and it arrived timely and packaged well.  The color is not a bright yellow, but more of a maize yellow, but coordinates well with my brightly striped chair cushions!  I think the more muted color will help keep it looking nice longer - I think a brighter yellow would fade and/or look discolored sooner

My husband and I had been talking about getting a detector on and off for over a year.  The more we looked into it, the more confused we were. We didn't know what features we needed or what to look for. We didn't want to spend too much but were afraid to go too low and end up with one that didn't work well.  We decided on this one based on other reviews and price.
It came with a video which helped us understand about the model and how they work in general. Just practicing around the yard he found two colonial coins.  We've only taken it on one camping trip and found a silver dime, some quarters, pennies, and a silver Mexican Peso in New Hampshire about 4 inches deep.  My husband is getting the hang of it.  The more items you find, the more you understand it.  He says that when it says it's junk, turns out it is junk and it's been right on with quarters and smaller coins.  
We are very happy with the unit and feel we made the right choice.  I would have given it one more star but my husband hasn't found any jewelry yet

I've owned the Bounty Hunter Land Star for about 2 years now and it is a great, economically priced detector.  Shop around because you can get it for less then one hundred dollars if you know where to look... cough... ebay... cough... ebay.

I've found tons of silver coins with this detector.  It's target processor is extremely reliable for coins.  If you get a solid repeatable coin tone then you've got a 95% chance of digging up a coin.  I've also found Civil War buttons, old toys, and multiple rings at the beach.  Yesterday I found 2 Mercury Head dimes (1918 and 1941) in a local park.  Believe me when I tell you that treasure is in the ground everywhere.

Contrary to another review that you may see below, the All-Metal mode works exactly as it should.  Not only does it work as it should, but it is the most useful and descriptive mode on this machine.  Mr. David Carlson obviously doesn't know how to operate his metal detector.  The symptoms that he describes are the result of someone not reading the manual.  He doesn't understand the relationship between All-Metal mode and Ground Balance.  It just takes a moment to read and understand.

Bottom line:  Great metal detector to get you into the hobby cheaply so that you can begin finding some great stuff.  Like I said, I've been using mine for 2 years and I don't feel the need to upgrade

We are growing this in Arizona and having a fair amount of luck.  So far the plants are thriving well.  It helped to start them in peat pots.  The soil here is clay, so after they had their second leaves we transplanted them into the garden.  For our first time they haven't been much trouble yet.  Easy seeds to grow

I've only used my rack for cooking chickens, but I'm looking forward to doing a turkey soon. I've never sprayed the rack with non-stick cooking spray, there's no need to. Everything comes off, and it cleans up beautifully in the dishwasher. I like the fact that I can put the chicken on the rack way before I put it on the grill - the rack makes it easy to get the chicken back into the house, too. I typically put the rack and cooked chicken on a cookie sheet, and carve the chicken right on the rack. Well made, tons of uses, yet inexpensive. Does it get any better

I used my last little smokey at least 3 days a week 6 mounths of the year here in MN for 18 years. I am only cooking for two so it works out perfect because you get the preformance of a Webber but you use verry little charcoal. Don't forget to shut the vents when you are done cooking, this smuthers the coals then you can just add about half as much as you would otherwise need next time. Getting a chimney gets your charcoal ready with only newsprint as your starting aid in about 10 minutes. As far as preformance goes you can't beat a Webber you can grill (no lid extreamly hot), or you can smoke or bake with the lid on. Read the cook book that comes with your grill and you will be an expert in no time. The only negative is they replaced the wooden handle with plastic.

I was really hoping for a larger grill but I should have read the measurements! After reading the directions, you have to put a foil drip pan in the bottom and surround this with your coals...then if you are cooking something that needs a longer cooking time, you have to keep adding coals..I don't get how you would do this if you have a grill full of HOT food..seems a little inconvenient to me.  It will be okay for a few burgers and dogs but I think I'll invest in a larger grill next time

This is my second Smokey Joe: The first one (about 11 years old) really only needed the charcoal grate so I figured I'd get a new grate and pass that one on to one of my children and have a new one for me. Although it's relatively small in size, I've done 7 BIG burgers or 5-6 chicken breast-quarters with smoked sausage at one time. And it doesn't require a big amount of charcoal to do the job. After cleaning the cooking grate and the housing it now looks almost new. Would I recommend it - You bet

I sent this to a male friend of mine. I find men difficult to shop for, however this was an excelelnt choice. It actually does project the time onto the wall or ceiling. According to my friend, the alarm works well and is loud enough. There is a unit that you place outside and it recieves the accurate time from an atomic clock that it then broadasts back to the in house unit. It also acts as a thermometer so you know the outside temp. Your man should be pleased with this

Works great.  I have wanted a projection clock for quite some time. This one works wonderfully and the cost was wonderful also. I still have not installed the outside sensor as I'm trying to find the "perfect" location.
You can't go wrong with this one

This thermometer is terrific. It works quickly and the handle is long enough that you don't burn yourself on the heat from the coals. I highly recommend this product

I am a southern guy from GA, and have been using outside cookers all of my adult life.  This one is a winner, you can't go wrong with this purchase if you enjoy using an outside cooker.  With the various size cooking pots, you can cook for 2 or 20.  Very simple to set up and use.  I really like this one and the price was a bargin.

THIS TURKEY FRYER WAS A SUPERB PRICE COMPARED TO THE STORES- IT WAS DELIVERED RIGHT TO MY DOOR ON NEXT DAY SERVICE AND THE TURKEYS CAME OUT JUICY, TASTY AND I WAS TOLD TO NEVER USE AN OVEN AGAIN. IT ALSO MADE CORN ON THE COB, CAPONS, VEGGIES AND ZEPPOLES SO EASY AND SO TASTY.  i SET IT UP TO MY BARBEQUE GAS CONNECTION AND VOILA` IT FEELS LIKE MY KITCHEN WAS EXTENDED ONTO THE PATIO.  GREAT IDEA AND THANKS AMAZON FOR YOUR SERVICE

I have long been skeptical of "deep frying" at home.  The smell, the mess, the smell...Anyway, I recently decided to throw a fish fry and decided it was time to invest in a fryer.  The biggest issue for me in purchasing a fryer was the sturdiness of the burner stand.  Besides having the ability to heat 12 quarts of oil, I also wanted a burner stand that would hold the weight of 20 quarts of beer for my homebrewing.  I decided on the Bayou Classic.

This Bayou Classic kit came with everything and setup was simple.  The burner stand exceeded my expectations for sturdiness and the height was such that when using the 10 quart stock pot, you could place the burner stand on a safe sturdy work surface to elevate it off the ground.  I plan on also using this burner with my wok.  The burner was able to bring the oil to temperature in approximately 15 minutes.  The Fish and Chips turned out great.

Of course when using 350 degree boiling oil, you do not want your weekend fry festival to end with either a trip to your local burn unit or a reason to see if Allstate really has you in good hands.  Common sense must prevail and last time I checked, Amazon does not sell that yet.  Set your fry area up away from kids, pets and anything that you want to see another day.  If you follow that simple advice, all should turn out okay.  

Clean up can be best described as "sticky", but in order to get the life out of your aluminum parts, don't skimp.  Now that I have tackled fish and chips, I will have to move on to the other "must have" fried foods these days: turkeys, chickens, and Twinkies.  I can't wait.

I am now on my second round of herb kits and for this batch, I purchased three kits and mixed the pods to make my fall/winter mix:  cilantro, basil, parsely, thyme, savory, sage and oregano.  The basil, thyme, savory and oregano are from the new Italian Herb kit.

Everything I've planted either sprouted a day early or right on time.  The savory appears to be the most delicate of the bunch, but it has grown the tallest in the three weeks since I started.  The basil is the first to sprout. The parsely seems to be slow but steady.  

Your herbs will be good for at least six months.  With proper care, I'm sure you could extend their life.  These are very easy to care for and it's great to always have fresh herbs at your disposal.

I recommed this product to anyone who loves fresh herbs and/or anyone who has had problems growing herbs in the past

We had out of town guests arriving when our puppy had chewed our chaise lounge to shreds.  We ordered this chaise lounge cushion and it was sent to us immediatly, w/o special instructions to do so.  When we received it, it was a bit thinner than I wanted, but for the price and fast delivery, it was great!!!  The material is durable and of good quality.  Our kids have been laying on it with swimming pool water dripping off them and it's been out in the weather for 4 weeks and shows no wear.  Like I said, it's a bit thinner than I wanted, but a good buy

They are handsome and nicer than I expected, by far.  The fabric has a really nice quality -- strong, pleasantly textured, durable, and a fine rich color.  They're handsome, well-stitched and sturdy, very comfortable, and are holding up to the sun -- some rain too, I must admit.  These were a terrific deal ..

Nice cushions that dry out pretty fast.  Seem durable.  They also seem high quality.  The only thing is they are more of a tan color-- the picture shows them as white which is what I really wanted.  But they are nice.  Could use a strap at the top also so the wind doesn't constantly blow them over

The quality or this product outshines most outdoor wicker I have seen at twice the price. The sofa also is very nice and again quality is outstanding.
I am concerned about delivery of the chairs to complete my collection, as the previous customer has mentioned. Amazon, what is going on? Suppliers need to be more diligent in shipping collections together

I didn't know much about grills so I asked around. Everyone told me to get a Weber grill, and after reading reviews I could see why. I just got my grill this weekend and we have used it 3 times already..we love it! Very sturdy/solid, and super easy to use. All you need to do is turn the gas on, turn a knob..and press the ignitor! Everything we have cooked has come out perfectly, very even cooking. This grill may not have all the bells and whistles, but you can bet it will last for years to come.

Just got this grill yesterday from a competitors website.  I got super lucky as they had it priced the same as the E-210 by mistake.  So I was able to purchase it for 299.99 and they offered free shipping!  Low and behold they honored the price.  They did change the price back to 399.99 the next day...Anyhow it came in a huge box, thank god the deliver man was nice enough to bring it in my condo.  Instructions say 30 minutes to put together for the average consumer, but I would say at least 45 minutes to 1 hour.  Plus you do need a second person for 1 step.  After assembling we fired it up and instant ultra hot heat!!  This thing gets burning hot fast.  We did some shortribs and salmon.  They both did stick pretty good to the grates which was annoying, but I assume since it's new it will take a few times of cooking before the stickiness goes away.  

Plus the only reason why I was "forced" into a gas grill was because my condo association did not allow me to use my Weber charcoal performer(great grill) by the way!!  I am now actually happy they did force me to lose the charcoal because this grill definitely outweighs charcoal for convenience hands down.  I used to occasionally burn food on my performer....but I don't see that ever happening with this 

Although I got a screaming deal, I would recommend this over the E-210 simply because the 3 burners a must have for rotisserie and indirect cooking!!!

I can't wait to buy a rotisserie unit, summer will be sweet!

This product is great. In the beginning when I received it I didn't use it often. And was skeptical about it. One thing you have to practice how to use it rihgt. It looks kina simple but and with this fork you have to know how to catch perfect temperature. It work flawless no disappointments. Recommend, try it

Accurate and easy to use--just push the button amd insert. Better for grilling than oven work.A bit bigger than I would like but not too long-maybe a foot-and it does keep your hand safely away from splattering oil. Very accurate and sturdy.The on and off label has come unglued on mine so I need to reglue it

Don't hesitate to buy this grill!!!!  

For the past few years I've been switching back and forth between my gas grill and my good ole Weber kettle grill.  Like everyone else I prefer grilling over charcoal, so this seemed like the perfect grill for me...  

I was right!

This grill takes all the pain away from grilling with charcoal.  One push of a button and 15 minutes later I am grilling ribeyes.  YES!  It is that simple.  The chimney revolutionized how I grilled with charcoal, but this is 10 times better than that.

The propane ignition rocks, the work area is great, the lid holder is a nice addition, and the water proof charcoal holder is more convenient than I thought it would be.  Let us not forget it has a dual purpose thermometer!

It took me about 40 minutes to assemble, but that's to be expected.

Oh yeah, I ordered it on Monday and it was delivered on Thursday.

I have hosted three cookouts with my new Weber grill and have yet to find anything I don't like about it. I am so glad that I spent the little extra. I had purchased a gas grill 5 years ago thinking that I needed to go in that direction; fact is I used it less and was pretty unhappy.  Going back to charcoal is easy to explain; however, explaining why this grill is so great is very hard.  I guess you would just have to sample my cooking:)

I just love this grill.  I previously had a regular Weber kettle charcoal grill, but when my son took it to college I had the perfect excuse to upgrade.  
The grill is large enough to grill meat and veggies for a family of 4 to 6. The cooking grate has hinged sides. This allows you to easily add more coals every hour or so for extended indirect grilling cooking.  You won't believe how handy the very large and stable table is; it is very durable and cleans up nicely.  
Store your large bag of charcoal in the rain protected bin, then just pull out the bag to pour charcoal right into the 2 charcoal holders. The charcoal holders keep the coals gathered together to light well and eliminate the need for a "charcoal chimney".  You only need to run the propane burner for 5 minutes to get the coals started, so one canister lasts quite long. (I always set a timer so I don't forget to turn it off.) The charcoal holders are perfect for indirect grilling, just push them to the sides of the kettle when the coals are ready. If direct grilling, you can still use the charcoal holders to heat the coals, then use tongs to dump the coals onto the bottom grate when they are ready. Very convenient.  The bottom wire shelf makes a perfect spot to set the hot charcoal holders after you dump the coals into the grill.
The stainless steel ash catcher works very well.  (The non-stainless ash catcher on my regular kettle grill didn't work as smoothly and used to catch and jam sometimes.)
The lid holder is really great.  Just pick up the lid and slide it to the left and it is held in place for you.  No more trying to hang the lid from the little lid hook.
The thermometer is very handy to monitor temperature for longer cooking items.  If you are BBQing ribs or a roast, keeping the temperature regulated low is important.
All these little conveniences simply add up to a nice cooking experience.
I enjoy my gas grill too, but it takes a little more skill to cook over charcoal.  I have a feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction when I serve up a perfectly cooked meal from my beautiful Weber Performer grill.
Find a spot to show it off - this beauty really looks great in the yard

We bought our Performer about 2 years ago from our local hardware store. It was the best purchase we ever made! Its a beautiful thing to have a charcoal grill with a gas ignition....about 15-20 minutes you're ready to grill. For the people who own a gas grill and are considering the Performer but are concerned about dealing with charcoal...its a piece of cake (we had our reservations too!) and you're going to wish you switched sooner. Food never tasted so good

I saw a review on this grill regarding the cover already...I just wanted to reiterate that the cover listed with this grill is INCORRECT. The Cover numbered '9911' is not the cover for the One Touch Performer. You need the order the cover numbered '9986' to get the proper cover for this grill. I confirmed this with Weber. If you ever have issues with your grill...do not hesitated to call or email Weber...their customer svc. is out of this world. 

Otherwise, this is a fantastic grill. I grew up eating off Webers and I own an old school 18" kettle that I have had for as long as I can remember....a Weber Smokey Mountain Cooker (a must have) and now this performer. Although given to me as a gift, worth every penny.

I love this thing.  It is, of course, basically a Weber kettle, which is all you need.  The tweaks are terrific, though.  The gas starter works like a charm.  I'd thought that moving from lighter fluid to a chimney made getting the grill going almost as clean and predictable as turning on your kitchen oven, but this is even better.   The work surface is really handy, the kettle top holder is dirt-simple but works just fine, the charcoal trays for indirect cooking are nice, and the charcoal storage is handy (but more about this in a minute).  The built-in thermometer is really an asset.  It's an ordinary meat thermometer that can sit at the top of the kettle or be removed to use on food.  It's very helpful when slow-cooking using the kettle top to know what the temperature is (and fun, beside, to see the grill "breathe" as the coals burn down, or you add more, or the vents get adjusted, or whatever).  Then when you're about done you can pull it out and check the meat.  Simple but great.  All the little things add up to make this a cut above.

A few things.  The instructions that come with the grill can be read to mean that it's necessary to use the charcoal trays with the gas starter.  You don't; either a chimney or just a pile of charcoal work perfectly well.  Turning the gas knob just enough to get a flame, and running the starter for short times, will extend the tank's life; three minutes or so seems to be plenty to get the fire started.  And look for a scoop or something similar to use with the charcoal holder, or plan on getting your hands dirty moving charcoal.  Overall, though, this is a great setup.  I did a hickory-smoked leg of lamb last night that was to die for, and about two-and-a-quarter hours from pressing the starter button to on the table.  Fabulous.

I've had this grill for one summer now, and cannot say enough good things about it. Ours was recently blown off the patio by a particularly nasty windstorm and survived without hardly a scratch. For those concerned about the price: when you look at all the extra features - not just the ignition system, but the work table, the charcoal bin, and the tool rack - it really is worth every penny. Plus consider, for this price, what sort of gas grill could you get

I bought the Performer from Amazon about 9 months ago now and never got around to reviewing it.  Yesterday, as I was cooking some pork chops on it, I made a mental note to come here to review.

Personally, I believe it is the best charcoal grill for most people.  Like others have said, it is so easy to get the charcoal started without using lighter *gag* fluid.  Yes, you could use a chimney to accomplish this in about the same time and I have used a chimney for years.  But with a small child, dog, and dry conditions here in Dallas, the Performer's solution is so much safer.

The Performer cooks as well as any Weber kettle which is fantastic.  The work area is nice and the holder for charcoal is very clever.  I really can't imagine a better charcoal grill for the non fanatic.

I did have a missing part with my grill when I received it.  However, one call to Weber had the part to me in days.  It was a wheel so it wasn't a big deal -- I could assemble everything else.

Final disclosure -- I am a pretty big fan of Weber products.  When I bought this I had three other Weber grills.  I found that the Performer replaced both old standard Kettle and my Genesis gas grill.  The Performer is ready so quick that I just never used the gas grill any more.  Gave it to a friend and have no regrets.

this is truely a must have. the flat non-stick skewers holds everything in place, they won't flop around so the unbalanced pieces of food are always on the bottom near the heat. a friend told me about these at gander mountain selling for $7.39 a set, but i checked here 1st and found them for $5.99 a set. i ordered 5 sets!! the skewers are 14" long for plenty of food. get yours today, don't wait. get at least 2 sets.

I've used EZ Up tents for years at trade shows and other venues. Since I saw a review here that said it was used as a shelter for 8 months and then it failed, I thought I'd point out that these are not permanent shelters. I had one fail due to rain damage once. Left it outside after our wedding (it covered the caterer table) and we had a torrential downpour. The canopy filled with rain, the weight broke the support. It was a tremendous amount of water, the equivalent of a person sitting on a single crossbar. 
The reason EZ Up likely told the person they don't cover wind and rain damage is because in eight months, the thing had to have been rained on, and blown at. 
If you're looking for a fast to assemble cover for trade shows, street fairs, etc. EZ Up's great.

A great portable shelter for sun and rain. We bought it for a backyard event to give some shelter if it had rained. The weather turned out to be great and sunny, so the shelter was used to give our guest some shades from the bright sun. It was easy to set up and bring down. And the roller bag is also a good accessory to have to store and tranport the shelter easily

The price was right, The bench was larger than I expected which was a nice thing.  It went together easily and works great.  The company does not list measurements on the Amazon web site and I think they would sell more of them through Amazon if they did

This table is about twice the table you would expect at the price. Its size is ideal with a 2 passenger teak bench.  Kompur wood is so like teak; we're staining our teak furniture to match the Kompur wood.  It looks marvelous with the 30" round folding table. Fit and finish are A Plus.  Can't rate durability yet or it would have 5 stars

I love my Brinkman's Smoker. But I did some modifications to get it in its present state:

The offset firebox arrangement: Using plain old charcoal will cost you a fortune! When I first got this as a Christmas present, I found this out quick! I went thru a whole 20 pound bag of Kingsford. Too costly! So what I did was to buy a propane tank and a propane burner. I ran the burner's metal intake connector out the Brinkman's air intake vent. Perfect fit! The vent also held up one end of the propane burner. Then I placed a regular brick inside the firebox to support the other side of the propane burner.

I now have all the heat I want, cheaply and also I now have pretty good temperature control! I also agree with another poster that the optional temperature gauge placed in the Brinkman's cutout is a waste of money and would be inaccurate. I did it and regret buying that thing. However do get a remote smoker temperature unit that gives you two separate temperature probes and readings. This way you can monitor both meat and internal smoker temps without opening the huge smoking chamber lid which would waste all your heat and smoke! And speaking of smoke...

...it drove me crazy figuring out how to make a sustained source of smoke that wouldn't snuff out the propane burner in the process! Here is what I did to solve this new problem:

Take off that "Hobbit" external smoke stack. Then take off the flimsy end cap that holds the swivel lid of the exhaust vent. With a drill, carefully make an 1/8 inch hole thru the welded on rod the end cap was attached to. Replace the lid. Now, take a tie-wire or maybe a cotter pin and put that into the hole you just made so that the swivel lid won't fall off as you invert it....

...invert it??? Yes, invert it. See, you will be stuffing hickory wood blocks into this inverted pipe. The part with the swivel lid will be placed directly onto the propane burner. The end of the smoke stack should be positioned into the smoking chamber. This way as smoke is produced, the smoke will go directly into the chamber NOT THE FIRE BOX which if it did would snuff out the propane burner! And speaking of hickory smoke...

...don't buy chips! It is too costly! Buy instead Hickory wood BLOCKS. I buy mines from Home Depot in large bags for super cheap! I use my small axe to carefully size the hickory blocks so that it fits snuggly into the inverted smoke stack. Works like magic. Oh, one more thing...

...place another Hickory wood BLOCK you carefully sized into the now stubby smoking chamber's exhaust pipe, where the smoke stack used to attach to. The wood block will block just enough so that most of the smoke stays inside the chamber and the wood block will allow just enough air flow so that the offset firebox's propane burner will get its air.

There you have it. The perfect smoker that is cheap to operate and effective at generating smoke! And don't forget to place a metal pot ontop of the propane burner that is full of water. You need this boiling to create the needed steam for your smoker's performance

I have to agree with the previous reviewer who noted the temperature discrepancy.  Items placed closer to the firebox do get MUCH hotter than those on the smokestack end.  This is probably my only complaint about this smoker.  This problem can be moderated somewhat.  You can create a makeshift baffle from aluminum flashing that will help some.  You can also put an aluminum drip pan full of water directly in front of the opening which will not only deflect some of the heat but introduce some humidity into the cooking section.  Personally, I just don't fill it up with meat.  If you're doing several slabs of ribs, use a rib rack at the far end. 

Airflow and temperature control were problems for me at first.  My particular smoker works best with the air intake vent completely closed.  This is not an air-tight smoker so it's still drawing air through the cracks in the door.  By keeping the fire low and the vent closed, the temperature doesn't climb over 250 degrees.  

Concerning the temperature--forget putting a thermometer in the space provided by Brinkmann.  It's too high on the lid and it will read quite a bit higher than the food at grate level.  Heat rises, you know.  I drilled a hole just above the handle and mounted a thermometer.  When I cook with the grates at the upper level, this thermometer reads just about right for the level of the food.  When I cook on the lower level, the actual temperature will be 30-50 degrees lower than what this thermometer reads.  It's not totally precise but, hey, it's barbeque!!!

I've had this smoker for about 3-4 years.  I keep it under a covered area so it doesn't get rained on but the humidity in my area is always high.  I've had to repaint it once.  The firebox needs repainting now but that's been the only maintenance I've done to it.  I just clean out the ashes and the food drippings after each use and roll it under the covering until the next time.  Before each use, I line the firebox and the cooking section with heavy duty aluminum foil.  That makes clean-up a lot easier.  (What did we do before Reynolds?)

I don't smoke a lot with the Brinkmann.  Mostly I use a Weber kettle grill.  But every time I do a brisket or big roast or several slabs of ribs, I crank this baby up and it's never failed me yet.  Keep the temperature low, keep an eye on the fire and don't open the cooking section very often.  Just let nature, low heat and smoke do their job.

I got my pit back in '92 and I have not been kind to this unit at all but it has NEVER let me down.  I am finally ready for a new one and will purchase the SNP once again only this tme I will get the cover to keep the Louisiana rain away from it.  I BBQ year round and love the results I get with my pit.heat control seem simple for me I leave the smoke stack open full and the air vent open only a sliver and the heat stays around 200-220.  I would say invest in a charcoal starter for adding coals and wood in the middle of a BBQ session that way you do not get lighter fluid taste on you meat the person trying to do steaks and pork chops I sugest ya grill those in the fire boxand bbq your larger cuts of meat.   ALL and ALL this was a GREAT purchase and you will not be sad ya spent the bucks for this one :o)

I have had this smoker for about 8 years. As I live on the east coast of Florida, It has been subjected to a great many adverse conditions. Sun, rain, heat, salt air and the occasional 150+ MPH sandblasting.   The only degradation that it has experienced was that the 2 legs (without the wheels) need replacing due to rusting off at the bottom, and the grills had to be replaced.  maintenance is a snap, just regular cleaning and an occasional coat of oven black.   She may not be the youngest lady at the ball, but she still makes the best ribs, chicken and steak

I have had mine for 4 years and it has worked out great.  The main difference between this offset barbecue and more expensive ones is the lack of complete air control.  There are simply too many open seams to allow in air.  So... it takes a bit of tending to keep the temperature at 215f.  That said, with a bit of patience and practice, you can make excellent barbecue on this thing.  The metal gauge is heavy enough to last you several years (though eventually the firebox will burn out)

This unit is easy to load, easy to maintain temperature, and simply cooks the best barbeque. I have not seen any other wood or charcoal smoker that can compare, dollar for dollar. You have complete control over how smokey the flavor is (or isn't). I only check the temp once every hour. I have done 5 full racks of ribs (on a ribrack), not &quot;babybacks&quot; either, plus 2 pork shoulders at once, and could have fit more! Use all charcoal, all wood, or any combination. I also use charwood because it burns so clean. I recommend ordering the optional thermometer which fits in the built-in opening in the right hand side of the big door. Holds up to 100 lbs of meat! Has a drippings drain on the lower right. Firebox is easy to clean, I use a garden trowel. Tomorrow I'm doing 2 racks of ribs, 10 lbs. of chicken wings, and corn on the cob... I LOVE IT!!!!

i purchased this last year and i love this grill.  i always check consumer reports and they rated this very highly - i agree.  cooking is a cinch on this grill - wide grill and cooks evenly!  the only way this grill will catch fire is if you do not clean the grease after each cooking session.  fortunately, Lowe's was putting a whole bunch of of these grills together when i was looking for one so i bought one fully assembled.  way cool

I've had this grill for almost a year now and have had no reliability problems with it.  I purchased mine a Lowe's.  The grill has very good flame/temperature control and the side burner is excellent.  I grill on it seven days a week through the summer months and on warm weekends in the fall.  The heat is pretty even inside there really isn't any major hot/cold spots.  The side burner is nice since it comes with a non stick coated griddle for cooking.  I actually used this feature late fall during a power outage to cook eggs and french toast for breakfast.  The side burner without the griddle has a cast iron pot holder. The lid on the side burner is large enough you can close it when using smaller pots. Very useful on windy or chilly days.  Overall I am extremely pleased with this grill and I have had no rust or wearing issues with it.  The only drawback to the grill's design is the ignitor only works on the far left burner.  It lights the 3 burners from left to right. So If your only using 1 burner for a quick meal like hot dogs or hamburgers for 2 people you need to always use the left burner

I bought this grill locally after researching many others.  I originally did not want a side burner, but have been very happy with it.  It works great for cooking vegetables in a pan and is superb with the griddle for cooking breakfast.  I can cook an entire dinner or breakfast without using the stove.  I do agree that it did take a long time to assemble (about 2 hrs.) but is solid and works beautifully.  I would highly recommend this grill for the money it is a great deal

As I roamed through the vast depths of Home Depot I came upon a light which shown down on the Stinger UV-40.  My eyes light up like a child on Christmas morning.  I raced home to try out the product at approximately 6pm.  Without hanging the unit up, which violates the warnings in the instruction manual, we zapped numerous insects.  Currently it is 11pm and we have a pile of bugs reaching to the heavens.  This product is highly recommended because it decemated the entire insect community in the 80210 zip code while offering hours of entertainment

We live on the water....front and back!  We can not go outside day or night without these zappers.  We fog, put out larve killing donuts in any standing water puddles in the spring.  We hang two Stinger bug zappers.  Each night there is a PILE of dead mosquitos under each one.  Every three days we have to blow the screens clean with the air compressor.  I can go three doors away and eaten alive by the neighbors mosquitos.  We bought an expensive Mosquito Deleto- $400.00  What a waste of money!  It caught 6 mosquitos to the Stingers MOUND!  We have had bug zappers for as long as they have been out and can't live without them!  We feel safe about West Nile virus in our yard.  Can't say enough good things about these lights.

I changed my Stinger rating from a 5, to a 1 (there was no O!)

Stinger: 
Pros- With mosquito lure, killed lotsa bad insects (at first, then wouldn't zap small insects!?)- BUT! 
Cons- Their electric wire grid uses square wires that QUICKLY clog up. Pretty soon it was packed solid & killing nothing! 
I had to keep blowing it out ( air compressor) every couple of 
days- HASSLE! 

Flowtron "80!" (took puny 40 back!)- 
Pros- Killed lots more bugs, because it NEVER clogs up (zaps small insects too!)! 
The electric rods are straight up/down, so no cross wires to catch falling insects & clog. 
Dead insects fall out the bottom- Blow clean once a month... 
I used the Stinger mosquito lure, purchased at Wally World... 

Cons- The only con is that the outer protective plastic cage HAD bars only about 1/2" apart (same with Stinger)- This kept larger moths... from being able to easily get in to the electric grid. 
I used a large wire cutter & cut out every 3d bar- on top 2/3ds of cage- Alternating..., so cut bar was in the middle of two solid bars on adajacent side- Still rigid! 

I put it on an outside timer (for when evenings cool down- Not much insect activity below 55 degrees...). Adjust accordingly. 

Never hang it near a door, as their is always a 10'+ swarm of insects around it. 

Try to hang it over head high, in a DRY (electric) area.

This metal detector is the easiest to operate I've ever used.  Although it comes with a 9&quot; searchcoil, I also ordered a 12.5&quot; for deeper penetration.  By accident the manufacturer sent me two of them.  When I told them of their mistake, they told me just to keep the extra one, so I did.  Now I'm passing this all on to whoever buys it from me.  I only used it once, cleaned it and put it up for later use.  The only reason I'm selling is that I've decided to take up the hobby of Cowboy Action Shooting and need some more equipment for this hobby.  It is a great buy for anyone.  Also included is the owner's manual as well as a video.  Enjo

The hammock is fine, particularly for the great price Unfortunately, my pine trees dripped sap onto the hammock, which is a pain to get off. Not the hammock's fault - I guess it just wasn't such a good idea

The device shows a lot of info like it should.  Nice design and accurate as well. It's just as good if not better than the television weather forecast and current conditions. The only thing I would improve upon is the readability of the face of the instrument. It has to be read from directly in front or it is not clear enough.

The WS-9119U weather station monitors outside temp and humidity and inside temp and humidity.   Further it monitors barometric pressure, and make a gross prediction of weather change via pictoral representations of weather.  For the price, it serves a function, but it's not an all encompasing scientific weather station..... most of which cost hundreds, if not thousands of dollars.
This unit is good to observe outside weather conditions, monitor inside conditions, and monitor gross weather change.... for this it a a reliable and relatively inexpensive instrument

I've had this weather station for about a month now.  It seems to get accurate readings - only if you can find a good spot for your remote sensor.  A bit of sunshine will make your readings higher than normal (outside).

A couple complaints:  as one reviewer said the buttons make the unit feel cheap, they feel clunky.  But, I only used them to get it all setup so its no big deal.  I've had some mixed results from the barometer.  When the actual pressure is mid-range its right on (i've chcked some readings from local airports to see how acurate it is).  But when a low or high pressure system moves in the readings are off more than I'd expect.  However the important thing is that you can see the pressure changing in the right direction.  Lastly, the forecasting model it uses hasn't worked for me...yet.  I live west of Denver, close to the mountains.  This probably creates a local weather pattern that the unit cannot predict.  I did not expect it to, but we've had some rain, snow, and fog that the unit claims it can observe and did not.  It's only been a month so I expect to see a prediction that is accurate at some time.            

Overall, I am happy with this product and think it is worth the money.  There were many other models I looked at and I think this gives the the most for the money

Set up was easy. Just read the manual and follow the instructions. Don't take short cuts.

Forcasting is excellent after setting the barometer to match local conditions. We live over 1,000 feet above sea level. Adjusting for that was needed. Weather.com's zip code oriented barometric pressure info made that relatively easy.

The screen is easy to read and understand. The main unit has a solid feel and does not look cheap.

The external humidity and temperature sensor fits easily between a closed window and it's screen.

The manual could be more complete. It wasn't clear that the icon that depicts a connection with the national time service doesn't appear until after the first connection is made in the wee hours of the morning. When you manually set the clock make sure you do it in 24 hour mode. Then, switch to 12 hour mode if that is what you want displayed. Again, the manual should have pointed that out

Some of the reviews of this weather station looked pretty poor, but I took a chance and bought it anyway. Overall I am very pleased and glad that I didn't take the reviews too seriously. 

I found that the temperature accuracy seems to be fine; I put the base unit, external sensor, a second extra sensor, and my old Radio Shack digital thermometer all in the same location, and within a half hour they were all within 1 degree of each other, indicating to me that the temperature sensors are consistently acccurate. I also had no problem with the LCD viewing angle; it is adjustable and seems to have a wide viewing angle anyway so I haven't seen any need to adjust it.

One of my few complaints is that ALL external temperature sensors are shown on the display as "outside" temperature, where in reality I would think it's more likely that most users will place one sensor outside, and any extra sensors beyond that would be indoors (I could be wrong here). At first I was concerned that the forecasting function would be 'confused' by seeing several outside temperature/humidity readings that vary greatly, but eventually I found one sentence in the manual that indicates only the first external sensor is used for weather forecasting. So it's a little confusing but works fine as long as you make sure that external sensor #1 is truly outside temperature.

Another heads-up is that the base unit is larger than I imagined, and it looks pretty chunky sitting on my bathroom vanity. So be sure and read the dimensions

The cover is great.  The velcro holds the cover in place by wrapping around the handles, preventing the wind from blowing it off.  It's nice to leave the fireplace out in the winter, knowing it is protected from the elements.

We bought this fireplace and we LOVE it! Big enough to have a crowd of 10 or more people in lawn chairs sitting around and enjoying it (we had a family picnic and everyone commented on how nice it was). Small enough for storage in our small shed for the winter. Directions on putting it together were a bit confusing (per my husband). Ours also came with an additional piece to allow for outdoor cooking in the fireplace (we haven't used it yet). Ours also came with a cover to put over it when not in use which is perfect for keeping water out of it. Great buy!! We use it frequently! HIGHLY recommend it.

I really like these clocks. Our school was constantly having problems with the clocks in all the classrooms being different and this has really helped the situation. The digital ones are better but the La Crosse ones, which are the least expensive, also happen to be the best analog clocks we've tried

The other reviewers accurately captured the clock's great features. I will add that its radio reception is great too.  I put the battery in about 6:00 pm in California yesterday, May 31, expecting it to get the correct time overnight.  I noticed the second hand move a bit and stop, and thought "d*** it's broken already."  Not so!  While reading the instructions to see what happened, with the clock resting on the floor, it started advancing to the exact correct time, having received the radio signal in a minute since start.  The clock is now in my office and I don't have to wonder if I have the correct time or not

VERY easy to set up. Pop in a AA battery, push the button on the back for your time zone in the US (Or you can set manually, but then why? Unless you are out of the US time zones.)  Find a spot on the wall for it, hammer in a nail, leaving it stick out a little to hold the clock, put the clock up (the hardest part, as it's just a hole flush with the back, BUT! If you put it close to a door, you can see the hole and the nail) and WALLA! in a few minutes, the clock sets itself! What could be more easy? My cat even found it amusing to watch the clock hands move until the reached the exact time! ;)

Clock is made of finely textured plastic on outside, but looks a lot nicer than in the picture. Great to match black, silver &/or designer computers, Black leather desk chairs, etc. in an office or computer room. Directions say to set it up late at night preferrably, and that if used in interior rooms of office buildings it may not be able to pick up the signal to set, and thus you'd do it manually. 

Clock is larger than it looks as well, which is easier on the eyes than other clocks. The price is certainly right as well. I bought an old black school-type clock for my kids when they were young, very similar to this one, and since my son took it with him when he moved out I wanted a replacement! (My mom bought the old one when my youngest was a baby, when my older child was learning to tell time. It's been through being dropped when moving, a few earthquakes and just keeps on ticking! I have the feeling this one will do the same as it's well made compared to many of the less expensive clocks out there - espcially the projection type, which I thought might be a great idea until I saw the reviews on how many different projection clocks simply don't work, are cheaply made, and a friend's daughter got one for her birthday, which didn't work either.)

Great for kids learning to tell time too, so this could go just about anywhere in a modern decor room. AWESOME! I'm very happy with it so far

This clock was very easy to set up...pop in a battery and within 5 minutes it sets itself. It's large face and numbers are easy to read at a distance, making it perfect for business use. It was only a few dollars more than a clock with no automatic time setting, so it was worth it to me to have at least one clock I'll only have to check when the battery wears down

This lounge/deck chair cushon is worth every peny. It is thick, comfortable (none of those deck chairs are comfortable without a substantial cushion), available in several color choices, and has a soft, not plasticky, cover fabric. You will have to measure the width of your deck chair carefully to see if it will fit. It just barely fit my 'titanic' deck chair because I had to scrunch it up a bit near the arms. But all turned out well and I must say I am very happy with it. It is a quality product and will keep you much more comfortable during your hours on the patio than those cheaper, but much thinner, types sold at outlet stores or supermarkets in summer. Get the best. This is it

I searched a long time for a cushion to fit an old lounge chair which had slightly larger measurements for the new cushions at most stores today.  Horray!!!!!!!!!!  This one is perfect and has served me well for comfort and weather resistance.  It has been an unusually rainy month of May and the cushion justs dries with little or no wiping.  So comfortable too

I purchased my Oregon Scientific station 8 years ago.  The internal sensor batteries need changed annually, and I've changed the rechargeables outside once ... I live in Georgia and we get lots of sun.  Other than needing to reset the unit about every 6 months (gets confused by near lightning strikes, but then what wireless electronics don't?) and perhaps not the high precision Rain Gauge I'd like to have, it's more than adequate for any home weather enthusiast

I was a little reluctant to purchase these because I had heard a lot of things about the spring mechanism in them being faulty but that they were being recalled and fixed.  So I was wondering if the one I bought was a fixed model or not.  Well, it must have the newer design because I've been using these for a few months and I have nothing but good things to say about them.  I was previously using a long OXO set of tongs which were pretty good but a little flimsy for some of the heftier cuts of meat like, whole chickens and pork shoulders.  These tongs are sturdy!  You know that the minute you pick them up and feel the weight to them.  They can easily pick up anything you need on the grill and, because of the 20 inch length, you can keep you hand at a safe distance from the actual fire.  The handle has grooves for your fingers and thumbs which enhances the grip and they lock in a closed position for storage.
If you do any outdoor cooking, you will appreciate these tongs.  They're a well thought out piece of equipment you'll use for years and be glad you purchased

Well sometimes it pays to take a chance.  After reading a negative review of these tongs I went ahead and bought them anyway...I do love Steven Raichlen's show and his books. Well, either I have a disagreement with the earlier review or they fixed 'em.  These tongs work great, are very heavy duty for handling big slabs of meat like I like to cook, and the extra length keeps my hands cool without gloves.  I vote 5 stars. Keep on BBQ'ing

I use this for tailgating primarily. It is great because it's cooking size much bigger than it's counterparts. It holds temps well and cooks evenly like all webers do. 

It's a bit bigger than the smaller smokey joe, but does a nicer job because of it's size. 

I use it often and will continue to do so. Too bad it is being discontinued.

This is a great portable grill for the size. The 14" one would be fine for 1-2 people, but not more. This grill can handle more charcoal and has enough room to allow for 2 heat zones. 
The hardest part is finding one! I finally found one on eBay but, you better hurry!

Weber discontinued it and Amazon no longer has it.  My pal has a condo with a balcony (not large) this is the Weber for her - equip it with ONE charcoal rail and you get lots of indirect heat for smoking.  

Usually the 14 inch Smokey Joe's are too small, often my 22 inch Performer is too big, but this Jumbo Joe is just right.

Weber - Bring it back!!

Weber seems to have stopped producing this awesome grill. I'm so very disappointed that this great grill is discontinued.

the smaller 14" smokey joe simply does not have the depth between the charcoal grate and cooking grate to hold enough layers of charcoal to reach a consistent high heat. This is the only portable charcoal grill that does it. 

If you want a portable grill that's actually useful, this size is a must. I have tried them all. Smaller grills cannot retain consistent high heat, and you can forget about heating zones, indirect grilling with the smaller portable grills. 

What Weber may not understand is that many people have need for a good portable grill. City of Chicago, for example, forbid any charcoal grill on the porch. So we have no choice but to carrry the grill outside. Not to mention the big picnics, outdoor trips, parties in the park... small grills just doesn't do it. 

There's no open ash tray, meaning you can just shut the vents, snap the grill shut (with whatever in there) and wait 45 minutes, the grill will be cool to touch and ready to sit in the car - no worries about ash coming out of it. The charcoal can be reused next time. It's awesome.

I tried other brand portable big grills, and the design is so horrible, hard to clean, doesn't retain heat, etc. that just makes me miss this grill even more. 

I finally got this grill back after letting my friends use it for a couple of years. That's two years of abuse and it still looks shinny. I've missed this grill every summer since I parted with it, and I don't think I'll part with it ever again

Though this is a portable grill, it is terrific for at home use if you're single, or have a small balcony apartment. It takes very little space, and is easy to maneuver when cleaning time comes.

We took ours to a picnic this weekend and grilled two packs of hot-dogs at once (16 thick dogs). Because the grill is small, things get hot quick, and you will need to be careful with easy to burn foods that should take longer to cook. Burgers do well, steaks do fantastic. Chicken needs a a watchful eye.

I've used this gem for years. My apartments, on the whole, mandated the simplicity and efficiency offered up by the Smokey Joe. 

A great feature is the rounded top. This enables better smoking, as air and smoke circulates more fluidly. 

The downsides: 
The legs aren't as sturdy as they could be. Given time, a bit of bumping around and general abuse, and the screwed on legs might turn askew. If you notice this while the grill is hot, you've a problem. The solution is to keep them tight during nonuse. 

The air intake at the bottom gets clogged with ashes. A key to good charcoal grilling is the manipulation of air flow. The intake might be open, but stopped up. If you are diligent to clean the ashes, you'll be OK. 

Because the grill is so close to the ground, you need to be careful. Unlike most of Weber's grill, this one is also apt to getting kicked over, run into by dogs, cars and children. 

I fully recommend Weber's Smokey Joe. Now, I'm hungry. Time to stir the coals and pop on a few brats.

If you like the big Weber grills but need a small one for tailgating, this is a Great choice. 
I have no problem putting 3, 4, or even 5 steaks on this grill with no problem. 
It's tight and well built.
The only thing I don't like is the kind of cheap side went covers. They come flat so they don't conform to the shape of the grill. You have to kind of form them by bending them around your knee or something and then they fit fine.

I give this grill 9 out of 10 Brats. 

EDIT, ONE YEAR LATER: They made a big mistake moving the vent holes from the traditional place on the bottom of the kettle to the sides. It completely changes the air flow and the result is a consistently cold fire. My three minutes per side burgers on the normal Webber are more like five or six minutes per side on this little grill. 
The bottom line is that this grill is ok for tailgating and camping, but I don't use it nearly as much as I thought I would and if I HAD to have just one grill, I'd get one of the other Webbers with the vents on the bottom. This grill has been a disappointment for me

I love this grill just last night i made pizza on it for the first time it's got a awesome amount of cooking space for such a portable grill. it's great we use it on our patio all the time.
the build quality is great and it's very easy to clean
i think they even added some vents into the design so the airflow is awesome...
and with amazons free shipping you cant find a better deal anywhere

This is an excellent little grill for home or the road. The lid lock is a godsend and the side benefit is that due to the construction of the piece, smokey joe is an apt name. the carry handle is awesome. The side vents direct air such that I almost always have beautiful smoke filling my little grill and infusing my meal with fabulous flavor. I've had mine for over a decade and while I've gone through another big Weber kettle and now a huge smoker, this little number is still in the race and I have NO intentions of giving it up. I'm taking it camping with me next weekend. It's a no-brainer. Buy it and be happy

This is our second Weber grill in the past 10 years.  In fact the new grill is essentially the exact same grill as the one we purchased in the '90s...same size and features.  We actually use natural gas rather than propane (I goofed on the order), but we were able to quickly transplant the conversion kit from the old grill to the new one.  We've used it a few times and it works perfectly.  Quickly heats up and grills evenly.  Looking forward to many years of great meals off this grill

For whatever reason, Weber has renamed the Genesis line Spirit for 2007. I just bought a new Weber Genesis 3 weeks ago (prior to the name change) after owning my last one for 11 years. There's a 3 burner model and a 2 burner model. If you're reading this you're looking at the 2 burner model.

Excellent product. 2 burners are more than sufficient; I don't know why they even have a 3 burner model since the 3 burner model isn't really that much bigger. The 2 burner model has plenty of room for the needs of everyday family grilling and entertaining a decent size group.

There's plenty of product info on this page from Amazon and the manufacturer, so let me tell you a few things that I do to make my Weber work best for me. 

-Most importantly...keep it covered. Amazon sells a cover...get it. Not coving it will cut its life in half at least. 
-Cover the funnel shaped grease drip pan with tin foil and change it regularly; otherwise build-up in the trap can catch fire and THAT does not make a steak taste very good. 
-Change the disposable grease traps regularly (otherwise they start to stink). 
-Get yourself a quality wire brush and use it before each use...NOT after. The build-up on the cooking grates after each use actually protects them from the elements. 
-Before each use, after you wire brush the grates, put some cooking oil on some paper towels and wipe the grates down. 
-Pre-heat the grill on high for at least 5 - 10 minutes; it burns off anything left over from the cleaning and makes the cooking grates nice and hot. 
-Initiate cooking steaks, chops, any cuts of meat (even burgers...no, not hot dogs) on just-over-medium heat for no more than 2 minutes on each side and flip before cooking to your liking. This brief searing of each side locks in the flavor of your cut of meat. 
-Cook with a closed cover; normal cuts of meat shouldn't take more than a total of 10 minutes (including the searing). 
-Let your meat sit for up to 5 minutes before slicing (or biting into it!). This locks in the juices; if the juices are too hot when you slice (or bite), they'll run right out of your cut of meat. 

There you go. Hope that helps. And don't forget to cover the grill after it cools. Bon appetit!

First, I would like to say, with a bit of trial and error, this is a very good product. Well worth the price. I want to comment on the great technical support from La Crosse, and the super customer support from Amazon. The first unit I received was faulty due to being calibrated wrong. Left La Crosse a voice mail and was called within 36 hours. Tried to trouble shoot to no avail. La Crosse followed up next day. E-mailed Amazon about issue, replacement was in mail the next day. Outstanding

So far I am very happy with this purchase. It seems to be relatively accurate with temperature, humidity and pressure readings, and the atomic clock sets itself every night.

I love having the sunrise/sunset times as well as the moon phase displays, And it's very easy to get that data for any city for any date without having to permenantly change the date or city on the unit. Very cool. I don't like the fact that the moon phase display is "backwards" - a full moon, in my opinion, should be a full white circle and a new moon should be a black circle. This unit shows the moon as black instead of white. But once you get used to this, it's no big deal. I really like the fact that all of the buttons are on the front of the unit. Some other La Crosse products have buttons on the back or other hard to reach places.

I have found a few problems with the design. There is a curved glass (or plastic) cover over the entire display that is very reflective. The reflections make it impossible to read across the room. In fact it's difficult to read standing right in front of it because of the reflections. It's best to stand just slightly to the right or left.

I was excited about the fact that the display shows the high and low temperature and humidity at all times for each of 3 sensors. However, I was dissapointed that you can't recall the date and time that the high and low was recorded, as you can with other La Crosse products. Also, when you reset the high/low, you have to reset all sensors at once instead of being able to reset each individually.

It can be challenging to set up 3 remote sensors, especially when you have more than 1 base unit, but it can be done (I also have a La Crosse alarm clock that projects the time and outdoor temp on the ceiling, so I wanted to get both units to read the same sensor as #1).

Although this may sound like a negative review, it's really not. The features and functionality of this unit far outweigh it's shortcomings. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants the features it provides. Make sure the dimensions fit your needs. It might be a bit large to sit on a desk - best to hang it on a wall. It also comes in oak instead of brushed aluminum sides.

You'll need a large throw pillow for a back cushion - 20" at least. Also, the chair is fairly low. Seat cushion is okay, about the same quality as Target or Home Depot. Construction is plastic wicker over a steel frame, so I suspect some rusting over the years. Overall, a very nice chair, at a decent price-point. If you want a nice patio chair cover that fits fairly well, check out Veranda Patio Chair Cover 78932 on Amazon ($19 each). The cover is heavy duty, and is waterproof

This chair is stylish and comfortable.  It's hard to tell what the wicker is made of, which DOES NOT look like plastic (even though I suspect it is).  The wicker is smooth and looks high quality.  The cushion is firm and deep.  We've had it a while now and it's stood up to rough treatment from our kids.  Delivery was unexpectedly quick, within ten days

We love these chairs! We have been looking and didn't want to spend 1000 dollars just for one chair. We ended up buying 4 chairs and the sofa. The look great around our pool and all our friends rave, about them. We had seen some chairs from frontgate and these were just as good, but at a fraction of the cost.

I bought 2 of these chairs back in June 06.  They are great!  They are built well and look wonderful.  Very comfortable and roomy.  I have them in an area that gets diffused light, but they got rained on alot.  With winter upon us, I  now have them stored outside under a protective cover.  I would definately buy more of this line.  Local stores want $300 - $400 for a chair of this quality.  Great buy

Received this item and its great!! I have this under a gazebo and wanted an Asian modern look with straight lines. This was perfect. The type of wicker, (actually plastic) is VERY durable. The cushions are thick and actually solid. Some are real soft (cheap). These are not. This chair is really wide and sits low to the ground. I could not have asked for better. I bought the whole set and everything is great. Email me with any questions. chris.schaffner@gmail.com Orange County C

I've been looking for an atomic clock with functions and design. I finally found it with the 8249.  The large display is very nice.  All info are logically located on the display.  One quick glance, and I know the time, indoor/outdoor temp, humidity, day, date, and month.  The clock update itself about 2 to 3 times a day.  I can't really ask for more than this, especially the price on Amazon was really good

I got this feeder for my husband for Christmas last year, and recently purchased another as a house gift.  It is lovely even when not filled, and is sturdy even though it looks delicate.  We have had several storms with hard wind and rain, and had no problems.  The glass globes are easy to fill and clean.  It has not attracted many hummingbirds, but as many as the nearby red flowers.  We did not notice any bees until late October, and then only a few

This solved my problem of ants in the feeder... had it hanging on our deck all summer long, and they never got to it!  This feeder is also very easy to clean, and because it is made of glass does not pick of that aging, hazy appearance.  I highly recommend it to anyone

I just received the feeder this morning and hung it up in my yard.  I put sugar water in the globes, and had a hummingbird feed from it within just 2 hours of hanging it up!  I was impressed.    BUT, this feeder is not as cute as shown in the picture.  It is actually big and bulky.  Also, the construction is sub-par.  Looks kinda cheap and plasticy.

I am impressed with the accuracy and durability of this item, but it is far from "instant read".  I conduct several temperatue audits for a major food chain and many of the readings take several minutes to stabilize.  Overall, it is worth the cost

This thermometer has been very useful.  It registers the temperature quickly and the numbers are easy to read even with bi-focals.  The cover becomes a handle so your fingers don't get to close to the flame when grilling.  I would recommend it

Once they end and are spent I plan on replacing them again with the Cherry Tomato Kit as nothing is like a cherry tomato right off the vine!

This durable grill mat does an excellent job.  The product's material absorbs grease without burning or warping.  In my opinion, what I like best about it is that it catches and holds the majority of solid particles which fall from the grill (which turn into hard-to-clean stains just as often as grease).  It is very easy to clean.  I highly recommend this product

I purchased this outdoor atomic clock three months ago and hung it out by our backyard pool.  It is sheltered a bit by the roof overhang, but it still gets some blowing wind and rain.  So far, the clock has kept perfect atomic time.  The temperature indicator is a bit small, so we really can't see that feature from the pool deck, but the hands on the clock are easy to read.  This clock serves our purpose perfectly.  I have read reviews that say outdoor clocks like this aren't really suited for the weather, but I have no complaints, and it's been 90 days of crazy Florida weather.  We got the clock with free shipping, so the price was right, too.  Great clock, great deal

I am using this clock indoors, very nice looks and large enough to use on a big wall without looking "cheap".   The main concern I had before getting this was the battery life, I have heard bad stories about some atomic clocks using up a battery(s) in as little as 30-45 days, but since receiving this 3 months ago, it's still going strong on the first charge of the rechargeable battery I put in.  I really like the fact that I can easily tell what time it is from across the room and down the hall without my glasses even being pretty badly near-sighted

This is the third of three of these clocks that I have purchased for our city council chambers.  At first I was somewhat leery that the location of our chambers would make it difficult for the clocks to automatically set themselves via the radio setting, but this turned out to be unwarranted.  As a result we have three clocks now that automatically keep perfect time, all synchronized, and all automatically adjusting for daylight savings time and standard time.  In the past, keeping three clocks in one room synchronized was impossible, and was made more difficult since these were 15 feet up on the wall.  The features of the temperature and humidity were an added bonus.  The price was about 25% as much as compared to other clocks our city was investigating.  In all, I am totally impressed with these clocks, their operation, and their pricing, so much so, that I bought two for my home and one for my travel trailer

Sorry to see the other poor reviews of this product, because we think this is the best thing since sliced bread!  We bought four of these pest repellers and found that they kill all the flies and spiders in the house.  We have lots of plants that are breeding grounds for fruit flies; this product disrupts their teeny little lives, and no sooner are some hatched than they disappear.  We have to vacuum up the dead house flies and spiders periodically, and we have Black & Decker to thank!  I'm buying more--for the rest of the house and garage and for gifts

We have a Brinkmann 810-7080-7 Gourmet Electric Smoker & Grill and when using it the first time we were really impressed with the end product, pork spareribs.  We put a dry rub on the ribs including:
1=McCormick Grill Mates, Mesquite
2=Garlic Salt
3= Onion Salt
4=Lemon Pepper
We put blocks of Hickery wood around the electric coil in the bottom of the smoker. We are not sure if the ribs had either a Mesquite or Hickkery smoke flavor, but they were outstanding.

Have only used the smaller chicken base.  Chicken came out great.  Easy to fill cooker with whatever savory concoction one likes.  Imparts nice flavor and moistness to the birds.  Easy to clean.  Should not have to pay for two Turkey cookers to get two Chicken cookers, though.

I previously grew the salad greens, which thrived, but weren't as handy as having fresh herbs growing, especially when one considers the high prices of fresh herbs at the grocery store.  I am just trying to be patient and check out the growth on a daily basis

I am now on my second round of herb kits and for this batch, I purchased three kits and mixed the pods to make my fall/winter mix:  cilantro, basil, parsely, thyme, savory, sage and oregano.  The parsely and sage are from the new French Herbs kit. 

Everything I've planted either sprouted a day early or right on time.  The savory appears to be the most delicate of the bunch, but it has grown the tallest in the three weeks since I started.  The sage grows very quickly and is more robust than even the basil.  The parsely seems to be slow but steady.  

Your herbs will be good for at least six months.  With proper care, I'm sure you could extend their life.  These are very easy to care for and it's great to always have fresh herbs at your disposal.

I recommed this product to anyone who loves fresh herbs and/or anyone who has had problems growing herbs in the past

I use this along with the 807 BBQ fork for the BBQ and the Smoker. I use the BBQ Fork for grilling and this for smoking and roasting. The lighted digital dial allows me to see the temperature and settings in dim light.The alarm tells me when the desired temperature is reached.The silicone coated probe is very sturdy and has been problem free

I have used medium sized Kongs as a
breakfast/lunch/dinner bucket for our 
Bichon for over five years. I stuff it with 
a dried liver treat, a combination of
Eukanuba and Max and a Medium Dog Bone.

His five to eight trips a day for Kong 
refills provides a break from my sedentary
home office activities. Recently I had 
collapsed lung surgery and now use
the filling of Kongs for a six minute
treadmill break. He now joins me on the
treadmill for about the first three minutes
before jumping off to work on his latest
Kong. Kongs are a lasting feature in our lives.
The Amazon Provider of a two years supply 
of Kongs (6) was excellent and very competitively 
priced. I recommend both the Kong and Supplier
at a 5 star level

You know beagles love chewing.

My new beagle who came from a shelter loves to chew. I mean, he LOVES chewing anything he sees!!!

Since my husband and I work fulltime and we have to leave him in a crate all day, Every morning, I stuff low sodium peanut butter and dog treat, and he loves it lick and chew all day! And even after all day chewing, the Kong doesn't break at all.

I also like the Kong bounds and rolls everywhere because of the funny shape and he loves to chase.

This is the best dog toy I've ever got

I used this feeder last season, and now I am getting a second one to hang nearby. It's the best feeder I've ever used (and I think I've tried them all!) for this reason: it is a cinch to clean. The metal flowers are part of the metal base, which screws off easily. You just wash and go! There are no weird angles to try and get a brush into, or thick plastic flowers that attract black gunk and won't let it go. And the hummers love it!

If you have to choose one feeder this season, this is the one I recommend

Bought these for my dad for Christmas.... he saw the box they came in and thought it was a poker set. LOL He's always wanted a grill set. I love the fact that they are all one piece of stainless... nothing to break .

The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is because the box seems kinda cheap and was a little damaged. Not to the point were I would need to get rid of it, just poor workmanship.

Elegant and simple design with that awesome rubber handle that put OXO Good Grips on the "grip map". I bought this to complete my Good Grips BBQ set. The only thing it lacks that some BBQ'rs may miss is a bottle opener on the end of the handle. But that doesn't bother me seeing as I don't drink beer and it also gives the tool a cleaner design. If the dog doesn't get ahold of it, it will last a lifetime

After receiving my La Crosse atomic clock, I followed the 4 simple steps on the back of the box and left it hanging on my wall overnight near a window on the west side of my house.  Basically, to set it up all you do is install a AA battery and press a button on the back of the clock to set your time zone (ET, CT, MT, or PT), the clock will do the rest overnight.  The reception of the signal appearently clearest during the night, according to the instruction manual.

Anyway, the next morning after hanging it on my wall the clock was in perfect synchronization with the time shown on my DirecTV satellite TV.  I live in the greater Seattle area and had no trouble receiving the atomic timekeeping radio signal from Ft. Collins, CO.  I'd rate this clock a 5 star buy.  The only slight downside is that the construction is inexpensive plastic (not metal), but then the clock would probably cost a lot more if it were metal.

Note: The manual warns that this may not work in the interior of a building.  Also, the clock probably won't receive a signal if you're inside a metal-framed building (such as an office tower).  Wooden buildings with lots of windows will work best, especially if you're far from Colorado

This is an attractive 10" clock, white face, silver bezel (also available with black). The unique feature is the ability to synchronize with the atomic clock (WWWVB) in Ft. Collins, CO. Watching the hands speed around the dial as it initially sets itself is worth the price of the clock in itself. We bought one for a play room and liked it so much we bought two more.

After placing the battery, the clock begins searching for the signal. Generally it only takes a couple of minutes to sync, but it came take up to 24 hours. You need to set the time zone in which you live (Pacific, Eastern, etc). The clock automatically adjusts for DST (part of the WWWVB signal, apparently). If you live in areas of the country that don't recognize DST, there is a button on the clock to disable the DST offset.

Note that for the clock to receive the WWWVB signal, it cannot be in a shielded environment. We've had no problems in our home placing the unit in various rooms with an outside window, but I suspect it might not work in a windowless basement (in which case it functions as a regular clock). My company bought a ton of similar clocks, only to find that they cannot receive the signal in a windowless, steel building. Your mileage may vary

I bought this unit along with some adirondack chairs and a small table so that I may sit outside during the winter (not in severe weather) and smoke a cigar.  I must say besides being attractive and being easy to assemble that this fire pit allows anywhere from2 to 6 people to comfortably sit around it and stay warm.  I burn hard woods in it anywhere in the neighborhood of 2 - 4 hours and have not noticed any warping or buckling, the door is a little flexible but it is made of the same screen material as the rest of the unit and is holding up nicely.  It opens and closes easily.  If your wood has a propensity for popping I have noticed that the screen material could be considered a touch too large, but I don't think it is enough of a minus to give this fire pit any less of a ratin

This outdoor bird cage is ideal in the winter because it has a strong wire mesh that prohibits piles of snow or manure to fall into the living area of the bird.  Works well with mostly smaller birds, plenty of room for seeds and water, even a furry friend or two, can also substitute for a squirrel cage or a mini buddhist temple for midgets

Upon receiving this planter, I was quite surprised at the quality of it for the bargain price. Having no yard, but a heavily planted balcony, I do a lot of container gardening and have purchased many pots, planters and window boxes of various sizes and shapes at local stores. One thing that especially shocked me was the fact that the tray was included at the low price. It surely deserves the &quot;PPP&quot;! Thanks a lot for the pot

This is a great desk top or night stand clock.  Projection to view time requires it to be dark, but it is great.  Projection requires the clock to be plugged in with the included adapter.  Batteries are used for backup and normal view.

It's not the best grill in the world, but for the price it does the job well enough.  It cooks unevenly.  The front and the back of the grill are hotter than the center.

These birdie hose reels are such a nice addition to my yard.  I bought two packs and have lined my front garden with them.  They are a very nice heavy weight and the overall detail is much more then I expected especially for this price.   I agree the stakes could have been an inch longer however I am having NO issues with the size of my hose fitting into the track.  I am not sure what size hose the other customer is using.  It must be a professional grade hose.

Ready for Spring!

For the money, $10.99, I wish I had bought another set now that I see the price has risen.  These are heavy, and they stay in the ground where put.  I have had no problem whatsoever with them coming up due to pressure from the hose.  My hose is very long, ultra heavy and thick, and the guides keep the hose from going into my plants at the corners.  They are also very good looking and are a complement to the yard.  Now that the price lowered to $9.99, I bought three more in December 2006; the new ones have the same quality as the earlier one

You can't really beat this for $12! It's fairly attractive and seems pretty well made. It seems as though it will do a pretty good job at removing dirt etc. from shoes as the bristles on it are very tough and the crevaces are alot bigger than you can see in the picture. This would cost at least $10 more in the stores. Thinking about buying one for my other 2 entry doors

I got the mat for my sister, so I never actually saw it in person since we don't live in close proximity to each other.  She uses the mat in an enclosed apartment hallway for guests to wipe their feet after treading through the snow.  I don't know if it would hold up directly in the elements, but it seems to do the job in the setting that my sister uses it.  Upon receiving the mat, she was pleased with its functionality and style.

It is a very nice looking clock. I received it in the early afternoon.  I placed it on the wall in my home office.  It repeatedly failed to adjust itself over the next three hours.  I removed it and placed it facing outward against the pane of a North facing window.  It adjusted to the correct time within 15 minutes.  I rehung it in the home office and it has been keeping good time every since.  I am very happy with the value that I received for my money.

This is a great clock. When I bought it about a week ago, I put the battery in the clock, and placed it on the wall in my family room where my old clock used to be. That was it. At first the clock appeared to be broken but within 5 minutes it adjusted itself and has been running perfectly ever since. This clock can be seen clearly in my family room from 25ft away. As I get older I like things to be bigger and this clock gets the job done while still looking attractive. My wife likes the clock because she does not confuse the short hand with the long hand from a distance

This is a beautiful time piece and looks better after it's hung on the wall. The fine woodwork and craftmanship that was put in to this clock makes this a fine addition to my home. The atomic function of the clock works just like it was designed. I put the battery in it and that's it. It took nearly six hours to adjust to the accurate time, but it's designed to receive the radio signal overnight or when you have the best reception  . I highly recommend this clock. It is more than I expected

This cooking utensil is unlike any other. its intricate design is for the dumbest cooker or even a gormet french dude. Little do you know that this fork can be used as a stress reliever as well. say, for example, that your  meat is not turning out well at all, infact it doesn't seem to look like  meat anymore just crap, well with this fork you can whack the meat, stab  it, and then hurl it across the yard and, trust me, you'll feel much  better

There's really nothing more that can be said to further the reputation of this series of grills.  Those of us that own the Genesis E-310 series grill know how well this grill is manufactured, and just how very well it performs its duties.  It is, by far, the very best gas grill in this price range I have ever owned or used.  A couple of notes:
-The cross-over ignition system works wonderfully (it takes less than 3 seconds to fire up all three burners
-Those who say that their gas grill does not get hot enough to sear meats don't own this grill- I've had it up to 550 degrees on a very cold MN winter day
-That said, it seems to go through a good amount of propane when running all 3 burners on high...but that is probably obvious considering the temps you can obtain when running it on full.  (It will be interesting to see if I can get 500 + degrees to sear meats on medium setting on a summer day....).  The fuel gauge inside the cabinet is also a handy feature
-As always with this series of grills- No Flare ups, and the flavorizer bars do what Weber says they will, namely vaporize fats and juices into smoke that adds flavor to what you are grilling
-To keep this review balanced, there is one negative- I dislike the tool holders.  Although there are plenty, your tools pretty much have to have one of those leather hanging loop things to keep the tools from falling off or even to use the holders (a small price to pay I guess)

Finally, the Genesis E-310 I purchased came in a copper color, something I haven't seen on Amazon, or on Weber's site for that matter.  Maybe I missed it, or maybe I got lucky.  Either way, it looks pretty darn sharp on our deck when it isn't covered

I bought this for my husband for Christmas to replace an old (scary-looking) smoker.  It was a real pain having to ask his folks to send mesquite wood from Texas to Massachusetts, then cut it up, soak it, etc.
We tried the Bradley smoker this weekend while we had the unusually warm weather.  It comes with pellets of wood which get fed in automatically; much easier.  The prime rib was done in no time at all; we finished it off in the oven for a crispier outside.  We also smoked fresh kielbasa.  Both were amazing.  Can't wait to try the cold smoke feature

I bought this for my husband in December, we put it in December 25 (we have an acre for our back yard) with about 40 mole holes....the ground has been freezing on and off, and we put one in the middle of an old "hole".... Takes 3 D batteries and believe it or not the thing is STILL vibrating (sounds kind of irritating if your close) but who cares....beats the back yard looking like a new cemetery. NO NEW HOLES...you could chew more "Juicy Fruit" which the kids love to help out with for our small front yard, but that only lasts you about 3 weeks....I"m buying another for the front yard

I am very pleased with the hose hanger -- big and sturdy, plus it does not look cheap.  My only problem is that one of the leaves broke off already, but for the price,it's a really good buy.

I love this birdbath.  I've had it several months and it hasn't tarnished at all.  Due to the review about it being 'tippy' I added extra weight to it by putting sand in the column and then sealing the bottom so it couldn't escape.  It hasn't tipped over yet, and we've had some bad storms in the Midwest.  Highly recommend.  I am adding to my original post 2/2007.  Don't make the mistake that I did in thinking this was a COPPER birdbath.  My search term was 'copper birdbath' and I didn't notice that this says copper-finish.  Some metal/gray spots are starting to show up in the bowl of the birdbath.  I should have read the description more carefull

This is beautiful birdbath.  If placed on solid ground (walkway, concrete) it will be great. However, if placed in mulch or in the landscape it is not weighted heavily on the bottom.  A wind will not send it sailing but will cause it to tip.  However, it is beautiful and looks great while it is upright.  I am still trying to figure out how to stabilize in the landscape mulch

This pizza cooker works really well.  I have a grill large enough to use 4 at a time.   A couple of hints for using the cooker ;turn pan 180 degrees ocationally for more even cooking and when dough is just starting to get firm, slide a non stick spatula under to lift dough out of the holes in the pan.

I use this for hand-tossed pizzas and it works quite well. It takes about 11 minutes to cook in a grill that has been pre-heated about 15 minutes. The pizza cooks evenly and the crust is perfectly done. My only gripe is that I wish you could get a bigger pan so that one could cook a larger (14-17") pizza.

Used it tonight for the first time. Made 5 pizzas with an average cook time 8 minutes. Bottom was a golden brown with very even cooking. A very good simple design. Faster than a real brick oven.

The ZaGrill rocks.  I had issues at first because I trusted my grill's temperature gauge.  After I was given an in-the-grill thermometer and adjusted to the proper temperature, my wife and I could not be more happy with the results.  Grilled Pizza (and a glass of wine) all summer long and no mess

I'm a first home buyer so with the nice weather coming up i decided that i needed a grill... so I wanted something that I could smoke too so the char broil smoker seemed like the ideal grill. assembly was simple. took about 30 min. I highly recommend using sockets and also using two different types of screw drivers a bigger bit size #3 and a #1 that will make the job easier. Also, I just bought mine at walmart for $79.00. Havent used it yet but the concept seems simple enough. Probably only be able to fit 2 slabs of ribs on it. so cooking for a huge group wont be possible.

I am thrilled with this purchase. I had initially ordered 4 chairs and the companion dining table. Upon its delivery, I went back and ordered another pair of chairs. They are very comfortable, generously proportioned, their overall styling very beautiful to the eye. I have subsequently received many compliments on this set. I just wish they sold a larger matching table. 

I plan on ordering the companion loveseat

I bought 2 sets of these chairs and the matching table.  I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived.  They are quite substantial, without being heavy and their appearance is quite nice.  The chairs came with no assembly and the table was very easy to put together with the provided allen wrench.  The feet on the chairs are adjustable so that you can get rid of the iritation of off-balanced legs.  Overall this was an incredible value at approximately $650 for the set.  I was so impressed by the quality and price that I have since ordered the matching bench

As an Interior Designer I was very pleased with the quality of these patio chairs.  I liked everything about them, even the cushions were thick and comfy enough for even the heaviest of my guests.  I have other Sunbrella cushions that are way to thin to be comfortable throughout a meal - these cushions let you sit and eat for hours

I am no pro at grilling, but this grill makes it all so easy!  It was easy to put together, easy to use, and easy to clean up.  Everything I toss on it turns about perfectly grilled and absolutely yummy!  There are cheaper charcoal grills out there, but if you're a petite woman, like me, who doesn't grill for a living, it is well worth the extra money for the little conveniences of this grill.  I got the 18 1/2 inch grill, and it has plenty of room for preparing dinner for 4-6 adults.  Since putting my grill together, I have cooked out every weekend

GOOD move on the part of the brilliant engineers at Weber who decided to go for 18 1/2 instead of 19!  And gold touch??? TRY DIAMOND AND PLATINUM TOUCH!  THIS grill is a baby queen inside a Mardi Gras Cake!  REally an excellent grill the ash tray makes it easy to clean, and two wheels are always better than one.  I will admit, however that this is not exactly a one touch grill, unless you own a personal cooking cyborg that will touch the grill for you if you touch its on button.. ONCE.  That's beside the point though.. bottom line?  This grill isn't bare bones, but it is affordably chique and grill-worty funtymes goodness

I don't own one yet; But I am buying one this week!  Although I am a diehard amazon customer.  I am NOT buying it here cause LOWES regular price is "half" what it is here.  My friend has owned his for a couple of years & loves it.  I have had some food from it & it was so moist & flavorful.  I'd recommend it, BUT I would probably check around to see if it's cheaper in your area.

I have owned a Brinkman smoker for 14 years...not this one, but the more simple model that costs about $85.00.    I have smoked several turkeys, many chickens, salmon, pork roasts....ALL with great success.  TWO things I can think of might help with your low temperature problem:

1.  Did you use an extension cord with it?  I once had the same problem you had when I used a long extension cord. Troubleshooting, I searched the manual that came with it and found that it says not to use long extension cords (you'll have to search your manual for the maximum optimum length).  PLEASE don't give up on your smoker!  I get much more  tender, juicy results than I do with my flambeed grilled meats!! ha ha!   The smoker is easy to use, no fuss and not too bad of a mess to clean if you line your water pan with heavy duty foil! I use Easy-Off oven cleaner on my two racks and water pan and be sure to rinse them very well.  I can leave for four hours and my food will be ready when I return (just be sure your water pan always has liquid in it)  When we have company, they LOVE the smoked flavor.  Hope this helps.  Once I eliminated the long extension cord, all was well.  
2.  Were you peeking at your turkey or basting it?  My lid also has a small gap through which the smoke escapes, but it doesn't affect it.  You cannot constantly open the lid to peek or baste as this allows the heat to escape and it will take a while for the smoker to reach the proper temperature again.  NO NEED to baste with a smoker! The meat is always juicy.

I found your review because after 14 years, I'm seeing rust on my smoker, which was one of the best of our wedding gifts.  I never owned a cover for it but always stored it in the garage when not in use.  This last year, however, it spent much time neglected outside (I have four children now) and I wanted to research smokers to find the replacement for our trusty old one! 

I would highly recommend a Brinkman electric smoker to anyone who is considering purchasing one (sorry, I've never tried another brand).  It's so much easier than grilling because you never need to watch over your food to prevent charring.  I guess you could say a smoker is to a grill as a crockpot is to an oven, except that unlike crockpot food, the meat will appear beautifully golden-browned with NO blackness.

I have owned this smoker for 5 years now and have a few insights for those looking to purchase this smoker.

 I have smoked  7 turkeys, alot of pork, and some beef all with really great results.

 I love that its electric. Regulating temp with charcoal smokers can be tedious. You barely have to do anything to it except add water and chips. It will maintain the ideal temperature of 220 degrees fairly well, But there are a few issues with this smoker:

1. Materials and construction- metal is thin and the lid fits loosely. The lid is suppose to fit loosely! There is no vent so it helps with the smoke. But because the metal is thin, on cold and/or windy days, it can be difficult for it to maintain it's temp on long smokes. Often runs 200-210 degrees.  This will increase your cooking time! On hot days it will run at 230- 240 degrees. Although I can't reccomend this modification to help with heat loss, I have actually heard of people fitting a electric water heating blanket to the outside of the smoker to help with this.

2. I wish the heating element was adjustable to help regulate the temp.

3. The door is small which makes it hard to add chips or water. Although you can take the unit off its base to add chips, this is akward and a bit dangerous since you may spill the water. It is nice to remove the base to help clean the unit though.

4. I installed an after market temp. gauge in the lid. (A must)

Overall a good entry level smoker that is super easy to use. Got mine at W-mart for $75. Anyhow, it's a great value for under a $100. Now after 5 years, it is about done and I need a new smoker. I will try to upgrade although after looking around at all the electric smokers, I might just buy another one of these. I love the "bullet" design of the vertical smokers.

 The stainless steel version of this model looks nice and is obviously made of better material, but the main section is attacted to the base. I do like being able to remove the base. Plus the element is still not adjustable. The only other choice is a  stainless steel meco smoker which has a better door design and a adjustable heating element, but is double the price. So I will either get this model again and do some modifications (temp gauge and maybe an adjustable element) or get the meco. Hope this review helps.

I picked up this smoker at Lowes for a lot less than Amazon.  I also bought an inexpensive cover with elastic that works just fine.  Overall this is a good smoker.  Assembly took a while since the handles didn't match up with the holes on the smoker body and lid so I had to hammer at the handles a bit to get them to fit.  Otherwise assembly was easy.

The food thus far has come out great.  I have done salmon twice.  I was smoking in 30 and 40 degree weather and the fish took the normal 2 hour smoke time.  Once it was heated and smoking the temperature stayed between 200-250 degrees.  I'm sure it will do turkey breasts and brisket just as well also.

I would recomend this to anyone who wants a fair priced entry level smoker

Been using the BAR388HGA-BK for about a month, now.  Appears to be very accurate for both temp and humidity.  Really helps in calibrating our whole house humidifier (who's hygrometer is way off).  Automatic atomic clock is cool, too.  Highly recommend

For the price you get the same as other units selling for double or triple the price.  The most important feature for me was exterior temp and humidity plus the unobtrusive design of the unit. All functions are easy to read on the display. Could not be happier with this purchase!

This is a great product to own.  We really enjoy being able to know the current outisde temp anytime we would like, especially here in Nebraska where we have so many extremes, summer and winter.  The inside thermometer is perfectly accurate (compared to our themostat), the outside temperature is accurate within a couple of degrees (compared to internet weather sites), although I think the variances have to do with sun changes, etc. not necessarily a defect in the product.  The trickiest thing about owning this weather station is figuring out where to locate the outside sensor, it has to be out of direct sunlight and moisture, but still within range of the internal display.  It is a great gift and we have really enjoyed owning it

We bought two of these.  We were very impressed how easy the set up was.

Since installing the weather station - we have enjoyed the accuracy of the weather station both inside and outside temperatures.

One feature of this weather station is a ice alert.  Up here in north we do get freezing rain ice, and snow.  This station has been right on the
button with those predictions.

I would highly recommend the purchase

Bought this for my apartment. Have two remote sensors: one in the bedroom and one between a window and the outside screen for outside temps. Works flawless and gives the same temp outside as it shows up on the weather channel! Humidity reading is great too as its led me to buy a humidifier for the dry months. All in all a good product

This garden bench is very well made and extremely attractive. The color is elegant. I have it in a small sun room and it is perfect. The cushion fabric is sturdy enough to withstand my dogs, but the cushion itself could be heftier. The bench is lightweight, giving the impression it is not solid and sturdy, but has supported whatever I have subjected it to---and I have 10 dogs that love a couch! I would give it 5 stars if the cushion were made of a better foam

I purchased one of these cookers at a grocery store for thankgiving.  I didn't find out that amazon carried this brand until I went to the manufarturers website looking for the 10.5 quart fish cooker.  I haven't deep fried a turkey and probably won't.  My main use will be cooking brunswick stew and chili in large quantities for freezing and cooking fish and chicken wings.  I'm considering getting a wok.
  I am very pleased with this cooker and would recommend it to any one wanting to use this for the reasons I use it for.  It should also cook a turkey real well.  The aluminum pot (and lid) is very heavy gauge thickness and the burner seemed to have a great deal of heat.  The pot cleaned up just by spraying with the kitchen sink sprayer.  I had to keep turning down the burner to get to a slow boil on my stew.  A bottle of gass should last a long time.  The 30 qt. pot was half full at the time.  I can see how you could do some damage with one of these if you leave some oil unattended.
The burner had two loose phillip screws from shipping and I hand tighened those.  The stand and burner assembly are of sturdy construction.  Assembly instructions are well documented with photos.  I started to return for a cheaper model at Target but I'm glad I didn't.  It's a great cooker even though some folks were mislead by some ad listings.
I would buy again

I love sunflower seeds, chocolate, and cherries, so you can imagine my delight when I found these Chocolate Cherry Sunflower Seeds available on Amazon.  When the packet arrived, I tore it open and downed the entire contents into my eager mouth, expecting an explosion of chocolate-cherry-sunflowery sapidity.  Instead, I got a mouthful of hard shells.  I crunched through the tough, outer hulls, wondering at the inventiveness of the manufacturers who had somehow injected chocolate and cherry flavors into hard, unopened shells, but then as I macerated both hull and softer kernel into a splintery mash, found that the chocolate and cherry flavors had somehow gone missing.

When my wife came home, I mentioned to her how I was ripped off by the Chocolate Cherry Sunflower Seeds which lacked both chocolate and cherry flavors and, in fact, were barely edible.  My wife picked up the empty packet, looked at it for a moment, and then hit me over the head with a dining room chair.  "You idiot," she said, "these seeds are for planting."  She then clobbered me with an antique, oak coat tree.  "I don't know why I ever married you," she continued, "you are always doing stupid, embarrassing things, and no matter how hard I hit you, you never learn."  She then whacked me with the coffee table for emphasis.

Maybe I had gotten a bad batch of seeds.  I think I will order them again, and the next time, the manufacturers had better not forget the chocolate and cherry flavors, or someone is going to get a beating

I bought these because I'm always burning my arms when I remove bread from my oven.  These gloves cover my arms to the elbow and are flexible enough to allow me to handle bread pans easily.  The price is outstanding; I saw the same thing at one of the chain home stores for $7.99 each

We gave these out for Halloween treats at the lake this weekend.

They were a big hit!!!  Who doesn't like glow sticks, huh?

Shipping was $6.99 for me ...so they were about 11 cents each.  Great deal!

We were short 5-7 connectors for each 100 bracelets, but perhaps we dropped them ...there were a lot of "beverages" involved. :-)

I purchased the 300 pack of glow bracelets for our high school group to use as a fundraiser (selling at football games).  It came out to about .06 cents per piece.  What several of the kids were then doing was combining 3 of them to make a glow necklace (there are little clear plastic connectors that come with them so you can do that). The combined price of .18 cents far beats the price you get glow necklaces for at Oriental Trading ($1.00 each).  And you can't really tell the difference between using 3 glow bracelets and 1 necklace.  Would recommend these for kids birthday parties, fundraiser, church parties, etc.

These Glowsticks are really great. They are the perfect fund raisers. The colours are vibrant and they do last for hours. I have odrered and used these many times and they are my biggest sellers at Carnival (Mardi Gras) time. Some of the connectors in the last shipment however tended to crack after a while, those came with the sticks in the blue 50pc packs. Those that came with the yellow 100pc packs in my previous orders were perfect!

All in all this is a very good deal. Kids and adults alike are attracted to these bracelets.You will make quite a profit with them.

I am a happy shopper - great value and fun way to quickly spruce up the yard. 

Bought this for my mother-in-law and after visiting her house I had to have a few for myself.  They hang from tree branches, water spouts, and lamp posts.  I have even been able to hook the chains together to make them longer.  I thought they would have a hole in the bottom for the water to drain from but I guess they are suppose to fill and slightly tip so the water overflows over the edge.  That works as well.

So far they have not changed color or rusted.

This Mosquito Catcher really works. It was in the fall that I purchased this item and it has been running non stop since. The "winter" here in central Virginia has been so mild that MOSQUITOS are still alive. You may wonder if it really works and open the tray only to see about ten or more mosquitos fly out. It also has caught yellow jackets (bees) and small moths. GREAT PRODUCT, I'm thinking of buying another one in the spring

Cheap and it works is really an understatement! Item is quality made. Just plug in and empty drawer every day or so. No bait or bags to buy. I ran this the last weeks of summer and could not believe the amount of dead Mosquitos in the drawer. I highly recommend this item.

After reading tons of reviews on various Mosquito trap technologies, I was skeptical that this one was any different.  Since the price was only around $90 I figured it was the cheapest 'gamble' out there, so I bought it and put it in my backyard, which has been pretty much unusable since June due to the aggressive Mosquito population.

Sure enough, I have emptied hundreds of mosquitos out of the drawer in the 3 weeks I have had it installed.  My highest total in a day was 50.  My lowest total in a day was 3 when I decided to add an Octenol bait to this trap...which acted as a repellant as far as I can tell.  This trap definitely works better in the dark when the little blue lights show up better.

There are still mosquitos in my backyard, and I still get bit.  I think mosquito conditions are so bad that even after catching hundreds of them it hasn't had a significant positive effect yet.

One word of advice I would like to give...place this trap away from any area you want to use.  I moved it from the yard to my deck for a brief time, and it was a bad idea.  All the mosquitos from the yard were on my deck suddenly.  Yikes!

We are nearing the end of Mosquito season in Atlanta as cool Fall temperatures arrive, so it will be hard to judge what effect removing a few hundred mosquitos will have.  I am anxious to see how the Mosquito Catcher works next summer during the height of the Mosquito frenzy.

Anyway, if you've been wanting something to catch mosquitos with, but have been afraid of the prices, this is a product that can have positive results without breaking the bank

I used this product for several days and caught several brown beetle looking insects and saw some small wings but was a little discouraged.  That was when I checked it every few days.....

I started checking it everyday and noticed that there were many mosquitos in the box.  You have to look closely to see the types of mosquitos we have.  They are small and dehydrate so quickly, if you wait several days to check you may miss them.

Every two days, I am catching about 12-16 mosquitos...roughly the same amount I killed when I would sit out on the back porch, but now I don't have to wait to be bitten to kill them.

May not work for some, but patience and deductive reasoning helped me figure out that mine was working

The TekQuest Mosquito Catcher is a sturdy, well built device that actually does what it claims. After setting up the unit according to directions, I allowed it to run on 24 hr mode. (it also has a nightime only mode) I let it run for a few days and checked the collection tray.  Sure enough, the remains of thousands of mosquitos, and a moth or two, had been collected. Once the mosquitos have been captured, the remains begin a decomposing process, so there is very little left of the pests. After letting it run on 24 hr mode for several weeks I switched it to night only mode. Once the sun sets the unit turns on, runs allnight until the sun comes out. So far it has worked flawlessly, and sitting out on our patio has become a welcomed event again. Thank You TekQuest

First of all let me say that there are some reviews that you should ignore, such as the one here that says that the Easygreen Sprouter is not a quality piece of equipment!   I'm a very fussy consumer and I can honestly say that THIS IS AN OUTSTANDING UNIT OF VERY HIGH HIGH QUALITY.  You can also do some Google searches and you will find nothing but raves about it and what high quality it is.  WORTH EVERY PENNY!
   Secondly, I'm starting to believe that everone should grow sprouts to get the vitamins that we are NOT getting from the food in our grocery stores. 
  As far as "produce" goes in our grocery stores, you may as well eat the boxes that they are shipped in!  Over and over in the media these days we are hearing them say that our soils are so depleted in the first place and by the time we get the veggies and fruits in our grocery bags they have lost what little nutritional value they had!  Even the organic stuff is questionable by the time it gets to our table, let alone the fact that some organic farmers are not really following the practices that produce nutritional food.  They may not be using poisonous sprays but are they replentishing the soil?  Ok- Enough of that!  You can find tons of info about that on your own. 
 IF YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING FANTASTIC FOR YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY  BUY ONE OF THESE SPROUTERS AND START GETTING THE NUTRITION THAT YOUR BODY BEGS YOU FOR! (No I don't work for them but wish I had designed it!)
 THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE ADDITION TO THE WORLD OF NUTRITION AND A HECK OF A LOT CHEAPER THAN BUYING EXPENSIVE VITAMINS THAT YOUR BODY CAN'T ABSORB VERY WELL. We have spent thousands on vitamins over the years.   Who really knows what's in them anyway?  You'll know exactly what's in your sprouts though.  THEY ARE ALIVE A PACKED WITH EVERYTHING A VITAMIN PILL WISHED IT COULD BE BUT CAN'T!!  It's so so easy you won't even believe it.  It's fun to!
The sprouts are OUTSTANDING  and the cleanest most vitamin packed foods you will ever put in your mouth. Load up a sandwich or toss up a salad or throw some in a smoothie.  Don't forget the  Brocolli sprouts are GREAT!!
I use about a half a dropper full of 35% food grade hydrogen peroxide each time I fill it with water every day.  (about one gallon)  This is perfectly safe and actually helps oxiginate the sprouts as well as prevent mold. 
I was so impressed with my Easygreen Sprouter that  I  ordered three more of these (actually called EasyGrass sprouters) and purchased a wheatgrass juicer so that I can grow wheatgrass, the miracle food.  (Check out Ann Wigmore "The Sprout Book" and her book on Wheatgrass )
 I can't say enough about THE EASYGREEN SPROUTER!!  Apparently people all over the world are catching on to this "Fountain of youth" piece of incredible equipment!  Do some Googling and see for yourself!

My first objective was to find an alarm clock with a programmable snooze -- this one's got it.  Second objective was to be large enough for day-to-day use but also useable for travelling -- this one does it.

The projection feature works great for me -- it's razor sharp and even at it's lowest setting very clear.  If you can't see it in the day time, look at he front of the clock (which can also be lit by LEDs by pushing any one button).

Yes, the buttons are not the sturdiest, but I believe that the need to use them often is negated by the fact it is radio-controlled.  You set the alarm and display preference once and you walk away.

For a $20.00 alarm clock, I think it's a fantastic value

I bought this clock specifically to have the time projected on the ceiling at night.  My wife and I recently got new alarm clocks that use backlit LCD rather than LED numbers, and we found we were having a hard time reading them at night.  We bought this clock as a solution.

My 4 star rating is based on that use alone.  It simply does not work during the daytime- the projector is not bright enough to complete with daylight or bright room lights.  That's good- a light bright enough to be seen during the day would be far too bright for night-time use.  You will be disappointed if you want to use this thing during the day.

I would have given this clock a much lower rating if I had intended to use the "atomic clock" feature, or to use it as an alarm clock.  Specifically:

1. The atomic clock only works in certain parts of the country.  The atomic clock broadcasting station is in Denver, CO, and the further away you get from Denver, the less likely you will be to pick it up.  We are on the east coast, and our house is on the eastern side of a large hill, and this clock has never picked up the atomic clock signal, despite following the instructions meticulously.  While it's possible we have a defective unit, based on what I've read I just think we're in a bad spot, and this unit doesn't have a very good antenna.  The good news is that the internal clock seems to keep fine time.

2. The physical construction is very, very cheap.  It is extremely lightweight, and easy to knock over.  The power cord connection is flimsy, and moving the clock (or knocking it over) will result in a loss of power (and your configuration if you don't have batteries installed).  The buttons are especially cheap, and poorly organized.

It works fine for our use because we don't need to touch it, but it would be terrible as a daily alarm clock- unless you are a lot more patient than I am at bedtime, you would not want to try to set this thing in a sleepy state of mind.  Unless you are a lot more coordinated than I am immediately after waking up, you would knock it off the nightstand regularly just trying to shut it off.  It wouldn't stand up long to such abuse.

But, as I said earlier- if all you need to do is put the time on the ceiling, it works admirably.

*UPDATE*: After using this thing for about 3 months, it spontaneously picked up the atomic clock signal.  I have no idea why (we didn't change *anything*), but it's been locked for a couple weeks.

I love this clock. I wanted a small clock for my bedroom and didn't realize it projected when I bought it (was an impluse purchase when buying a DVD player) I can't live without it now. I am nearsighted so this is great in the dark. I have given four as gifts (that's what I'm buying today) and I find that when I go away it takes me a couple days to get used to the clock not being on my ceiling! I will ALWAYS have a projection clock from now on. I couldn't live without it.

This tiny alarm clock is really cool. You have to read the manual and adjust how big and bright you want the projection on the ceiling. You can also adjust how loud and different patterns you want the alarm sound. It tells the temperature also. I liked it so much I bought my Mom one

I recently purchased the round tables for my classroom.  They are wonderful, and allow several of my students and me to sit around them all at the same time.  They are also extremely lightweight, allowing me to move them when an activity requires extra floor space

I am not disappointed.  This grill cooks hot.  500 degrees within about 10 minutes.  In fact.  I've had the grill about a month and I think I've grilled 25 days of the month.  I need to watch it with all the meat but man I'm loving it.  It's so convenient.  My last grill didn't cook as hot.  It didn't leave the grill marks.  It didn't have the flavor of what this grill offers.  There is not much to complain about.  I dropped it while trying to put it together by myself.  I thought it was going to break my floor, not the other way around.  This sucker is tough!

I'm glad I didn't go cheap.  I can't afford $1000-$2000 for a grill so this was a good medium for me.  My last grill I paid $250 for.  It rusted in 2 years and the replacement parts cost almost as much as the grill so I dumped it.  I think I'll get my money's worth out of this Weber.

At this price even with the shipping it was cheaper to order online through Amazon than to buy local.  I consider this one of the smarter purchases I've made on Amazon.

**Bad side.  Has nothing to do with the grill but Amazon shipped it through a company named EGL or Eagle?  For a logistics company they sure don't know what their doing.  The delivery date kept changing and eventually it was a week later than the original estimated date.  They sent it from Reno to Sacramento to Chicago to Omaha and back to Chicago then back to Omaha.  From Omaha they hired two dudes and a truck to drive it to Des Moines where I live.  Once in Des Moines they called me while I was at work.  I met them at a gas station on the highway and lead them to my house.  It took about 20 minutes to find them because the one that spoke English was still new to the language.  No problem.  They were nice enough fellas but I'm just not used to going to get my stuff when I order from Amazon. 

I've ordered at least 50 items off of Amazon.  Normally I track it thru the internet and it shows up at my door.  In this case I had to call a freight company to get the status.  Then the directing drivers around business.  I guess this was a special order and maybe that's why they can sell it at this price.

I'm sure I'll eventually love this new Weber SS grill.  But it seems to take considerable time to get the grill properly seasoned so the burners give off sufficient heat to cook evenly.  Of course, it's been winter since I received the grill, making it difficult to exercise ample outdoor cooking to thoroughly test & enjoy the grill.

I love how well it works. It heats up nicely, does its job, and I am satisfied. My only problem is the igniter. It stopped working and I replaced it. Even then, it still doesn't seem to engage when I press the button. I don't get it. I'm confused. Help a brotha out.
For now, I am using one of those long-neck lighters.  :(

After having purchased a 3 burner Kenmore grill about 5 years ago and on my second replacement set of burners, I decided it was time to invest in a "quality" gas grill. When I looked at the Webers 5+ years ago, they were quite pricey and not knowing much about grills I said heck no! Well, live and learn. After replacing burners twice at around $70 each time and the Kenmore flavorizer bars at $40 all in 5 years, I decided to bite the bullet and spend the cash. After lots of research on lots of websites I went with the Gold B. So far it's been great. Warranty and quality is a lot better then the Kenmore and it should last a lot longer. My friend has had his Siver C for 9 years and it's still going strong! Delivery was quick! I ordered on a Monday and it was delivered on Friday. Setup was easy. Grill heats up very hot and quickly even though it's only 36000 BTU'S. I just ordered the rotisserie attachment for it and I'll provide feedback as soon as I try it out. This grill is now discontinued from Weber as they have new models out now. I got this on sale at Amazon for $466.00 on sale. I wouldn't pay anymore than that. Look for a closeout deal on here or elsewhere. I'm sure they will start popping up.

I just got this grill a couple of days ago and I am psyched! 

I've always been a bit of a charcoal snob, but I wanted to expand my repertoire beyond just the Weber charcoal grill and the Bradley smoker I have. 

It was a snap to put together and it only took me about 20-25 minutes. I was able to lift it onto the legs in step 3 by myself without a problem; you just need to be careful. 

I did a ton of research and opted for the Weber mostly because of my experience with their quality products and I didn't want to chance it with a semi-unknown brand from Home Depot. I chose the Genesis Gold as I don't necessarily like all the stainless steel framing in the genesis platinum line, but I wanted the stainless steel grates and flavorizer bars that the genesis silver doesn't have. Also, I wanted the B as opposed to the C as I don't really use the side burner.

It lights quickly and evenly and it does heat up in a jiffy; I do like the convenience of gas. I've also got a smoker box for the grill to add the smoke that I like to compensate for the lack of charcoal flavor. However, for low and slow true barbecue, I'll stick with my Bradley smoker as the water vapor from the propane as it burns doesn't allow proper penetration of the smoke into the meat. 

This grill rocks.

The best thing about this grill is that it has two "swing up" surfaces for holding your platters or foods to be prepared.  A great work surface, easy cleaning, and no cold spots within the cook area make this top of the line.  Looks great too

You can't go wrong buying this great grill.  It was a snap to put together with easy to follow instructions.  It heats up super fast and cooks with wonderful efficency.  No cold spots as far as I can tell so far on any parts of the cooking surface and flame-ups are kept to a minimum.  You won't be dissapointed if you bring this baby home

Cardiologists recommend that as often as feasible, your legs should recline above heart level. Here is the first design that Reviewer mcHAIKU has found, measuring up to "the doctor's orders". 

These recliners DO give ultra comfort, are sturdy & rust-resistant. Since Spring 2006 this style has been available for one-third the fancy French price . . . SO, the shopper in me strongly suggests you search for clones at TARGET via *amazon.com* or a drug store. To provide more comfy, form-fitting neck support, shop *amazon.com* for a portable U-shaped neck pillow ~ ~ read mcHAIKU's 3-22-06 review of a favorite (ASIN: B000B4VWLO) in lavender! 

This TEN-STAR combination adds up to an Rx for easy sleep-overs, indoors or out:  HAPPY HEALTHY HEART WEEK ~ ~ EVERY WEEK!

My 62 year old wife of 42 years suffers from chronic pain deriving from fibromyalgic symptoms, a cracked tail bone, and numerous bone spurs on her cervical vertebra, - all coupled with severe food allergies and environmental sensitivities.  Ordinary sitting and lying down that we all take for granted as ways to relax are difficult and often agonzing for her.  We liked the first LaFuma chair so much after she had used it for several weeks that we bought two more and had them shipped to places around the country which we visit regularly for several weeks at a time.  I can't speak highly enough of the design and engineering of this chair.  Now if only I could  get the airlines to equip their planes with a few LaFumas, then air travel would again be something to look forward to.

We bought 2 of these chairs used at a garage sale, after longing for the full-priced versions at stores.  We love these chairs, but given they had had a lot of use before we bought them, one of the chairs broke recently b/c of the cords fraying over time.  

The good news is that I easily ordered replacement cords online by just searching on google for Lafuma replacement cords-  and for $19, I will have a like-new chair again (rather than replacing the chair for $150+).  So for those of you worried about the durability feature of the cording, worry no more

This smoker provides an inexpensive way to get into real barbecue.  I find that it runs on the hot side with a full load of charcoal, so it's better for ribs than something like brisket or a pork shoulder.  Still, what I've made so far is miles ahead of trying to smoke on a Weber kettle grill

I have used mine a couple of times now and have to say that the smoky flavor and easy use are the main selling points on this product.  The cleaning is not too bad, just a little bit of elbow grease to get some of the smoke and grime off the water pan and grates.

For my birthday, my brother was kind enough to order a smoker off my Amazon wishlist. I finally got a nice day and good piece of meat to try it out. I have to say I was totally impressed. I was impressed that I didn't burn off my eyebrows (even though it was close). I was impressed that the simplistic heat guage's ideal, really meant ideal. I was shocked by the quality of meat to come forth. Overall it rocked. So, picked up a pork tenderloin that I did a dry rub of

    * Sea salt
    * lemon pepper
    * cayenne pepper
    * garlic powder

on to the roughly 1.25 lbs of pork. I filled the water pan with a bunch of water, 4 cloves of garlic and a dash of port. I used some mesquite chips (thoroughly soaked) as my smoking agent and let it cook for 2 hours. The piece of meat came of with the most amazing flavor that I could imagine.

Necessary summer equipment

This is a great fire pit for the money.  It is deep and secure.  No fear of the fire getting "loose."  It also doubles as a BBQ. Great buy for the money

I'm so excited to use this table. The weather has been rainy ever since I got it. It assembled beautifully. Comes w/ it's own little tool. It's a nice strong, sturdy table but it's not overly heavy. I was able to move all the pieces to the patio and assemble w/o any help. It's going to get a lot of use this summer

I bought this table with the four chairs also made by Strathwood.  I have it on my patio where I can see the flame from our hot tub and it looks gorgeous burning in the dusk.  I have had a number of people comment on the way it looks and I have been unable to find a better value.  It looks like it is a lot heavier than it is, as it is remarkably easy to move and was a piece of cake to assemble even by myself.  The drawbacks are that the black mesh screen needs to be stored somewhere else (there are no hidden nooks where you can stick it for easy access when you decide to light the fire) and it sits lower than your average table, so if you need to sit and use the table to work or read, it isn't going to work for you.  It is fine for eating casually, though.  There are little screws in the bottom of the legs so you can level the table without using other hardware and if you have an uneven surface like I do, you can move it around and adjust it easily to stop any wobbling.  The other issue I have is that the chairs made by the same company don't fully fit under the table, the armrests are a little too high, so they won't push all the way under the table.

I love it; I am a 55-year old woman in pretty good shape and I was able to get it out of the box and assembled completely by myself. It arrived very very quickly.  My only complaint is that the bottle of "touch-up" for the aluminum finish, which came with it, was not securely closed, and leaked out, so that when I opened the box, I could smell the strong odor of solvent everywhere, and the bottle was empty

This is our first fire pit, and it seems to work great.  It is not too heavy so it can be moved around our patio and it looks nice.  The only downside, and I think this is true of all firepits, is that the bowl fills up with water when it rains and makes quite a mess in there.  I find myself cleaning the bowl more often than I'd like, but otherwise is a great

This table is quite attractive and substantial.  It sits a little lower than a standard patio table however one can still sit comforatbly near the table.  I suspect this is to prevent one from getting their legs under the table and too close to the fire pit bowl.  One negative:two of the screws where the legs attach to the ring assembly did not fit well and were exteremly difficult to tighten all the way.  I almost was forced to cut the screws shorter. I added some machine oil to the threads and gently worked the screws deeper into screw holes.  Overall satisfied with the table...and it is quite attractive

Short of having an extra limb the hinged grate allows for roasting/grilling with much less heat loss.  The extra control of the heat source allows for a better cooked product.  "This steak is b--tching", was a quote from the gameday crowd at Jack Kent Cook Stadium at fedex field in Maryland.  I will continue to "Pimp My Grill" with more accessories for next season

Pre-seasoned would be easier but twice the price too.  To avoid a smoke filled house you can season on the grill but make sure you can control the temp, too much heat and you cook all the seasoning off.  As far as performance it does everything a big heavy pot is supposed to do.  The basket is funtional for deep frying but not steaming.  Nice piece of cookware

This is one heavy duty cast iron pot! Very heavyweight. The lid holds a good seal to the pot. My only wish is that it came preseasoned. I sure made a smoke filled room occur. And of course, once was not enough to season, so I had to do it again. But overall, great pot

This is great heavy duty pot for a very low price.  I've used it so far to cook a pineapple upside down cake on coals and stew.  It worked very well, even without the usual camping legs.  This made in China pot has many minor pits and defects in the cooking surface but cooks well after two rounds of seasoning.  

Here are a few minor issues I had with the pot that caused me to give it 4 stars.  The lid has a loop handle that is really set up for a lid lifter.  Removing the lid with a pot holder is risky, since the lid is so very heavy.  The pot comes coated with wax to prevent rusting in shipment.  It is very hard to fully get the wax off, requiring several cycles of heating and soapy rinse.  The thin wire handles are the only secure way to lift the pot when full but its awkward and painful.  

The pot is great but the difficulty of the first cleaning has me looking at preseasoned pot for the future.

I had used a friend's hammock chair before buying my own, but his was made of very thin synthetic threads that catch quite easily on buttons, etc. Not so with the Charleston! The cotton rope that makes up the weave is very comfortable to sit in all on its own, or with the chair cushion that is provided, and, if it happens to catch on something, it's no big deal. All I have to monitor with the kids is how far they swing...

I love it, my wife loves it, my kids love it. Can't wait to take it camping this Summer (though I may never leave the chair. Someone else has fire duty from now on)

I have had to replace the igniter twice in almost 15 years. The igniter was actually still quite good. It is very well made as are most Weber products. The stainless steel gas box is what eventually fails due to rusting (yep stainless steel will rust especially if subjected to heat).
It is easy to replace and I end up giving the entire grill a cleaning and tuneup.

Can't say too much for a replacement ignitor system but it works.  It installed as easily as expected, and appeared to be of a slightly better quality than the part that it replaced.  If the previous part is any indication, it should last about 5-7 years, hard to believe in this time of designed obsolesence

Very simple to install if you need a new starter.  However, after installing a new starter, new burner tubes, and new flavorizer bars (all easy), I discovered that something was wrong with one of the valves in my manifold.  I recommend this kit highly if you need a new starter, but make sure you actually need one.  First turn the gas on and spray Windex (easier than soapy water) over everything that might be leaking

I have had a Weber Silver B grill for several years.  I have found that the igniter works for about two years, then just does has to be replaced.  This is an easy replacement, and is not expensive.  This ignighter works as well as any I have seen, and I think the minor cost and inconvenience of replacing the ignighter is offset by the quality of the grill.

The bench is comfortable and has enough weight so the wind does not blow it over. The cushion is real nice and it dries quickly plus it fastens to the bench with only two small velcro straps.Two people can sit on the bench in comfort

This garden bench is very well made and extremely attractive. The color is elegant. I have it in a small sun room and it is perfect. The cushion fabric is sturdy enough to withstand my dogs, but the cushion itself could be heftier. The bench is lightweight, giving the impression it is not solid and sturdy, but has supported whatever I have subjected it to---and I have 10 dogs that love a couch! I would give it 5 stars if the cushion were made of a better foam

Prompt delivery, packaged well, and the best part no assembly required.  The finish is a brown tone cast aluminum. It's very well made. It looks terrific with my matching fire pit table.
At some point I want to get the matching chairs.  Beautiful set

The pump works well, certainly as good as can be expected for the excellent price!  It does, however, leave at least an inch of oil in the bottom of the pot.  The instructions say that this last bit of oil is too dirty, and it is best discarded.  In reality, the design of the pump just doesn't allow it to suck oil up from that low a level.  I was, however, able to sufficiently filter most of these last few cups of oil using the pump and a large-mouth jar.  When poured into a jar with a much smaller diameter, the oil is deep enough that the pump can get to it, leaving only a small amount that I didn't mind discarding

A very nice thermometer, very simple to use, to read and pretty accurate for a thermometer of this price; at least it is more accurate than the local weather company.  Made in China, try to don't drop it.  Something that could be kind of annoying is that every 3 seconds the LCD will display the hour and after those 3 seconds will display the temperature, if it doesn't botter you (like me) you should buy it. I tested it in temperatures from 15C to 25C and works fine.  1 year warranty in the US and Canada

I bought this item after being bit in the face by a spider while I was sleeping.  It was not a pleasant experience!  We stirred them up after poking around in the attic during an afternoon.  I was finding the nasty buggers everywhere until I got this unit.  

Since plugging the Bugfighter in, I've not seen a spider, or any insects, on any of the 3 levels of my home.  I have one in the basement and one in the upstairs hallway.  They've been running about 2 months now.  We've even re-checked the attic, and not a spider to be found.  I'm in Northern VA and we're coming into Spring now.  It will be interesting to see what happens.  Usually I get crickets and a bout with ants and termites as the season kicks off.  If I don't post an update, you know all went well and there were no insect battles this year.  If I have ants and/or termites...you'll be the 1st to know!

Specific point...no noticeable change in electric bill for 2 months of use.

I hate to admit, but we have roaches! Actually, we HAD roaches until last week when I purchased this product. I had tried everything: sprays, bombs, traps, etc... But nothing worked. The first day I plugged this little device in, there was such a great increase in bug activity that my kids wouldn't go into the kitchen. By day 3, the roaches were GONE! I don't know where they went, and I don't care. This device saved my sanity

I like Oregon Scientific products, but their previous Atomic Alarms had quirky controls -- often leading to changing the time zone in the middle of the night rather than turning off the alarm.  This one's lots better!

The projection feature works OK, though doesn't really focus sharply at the close distances I'd prefer to use.  The eight minute snooze alarm is great -- just the right interval!

Overall, a nice, useful, moderately expensive alarm clock

This was the ideal instrument for us.  We like to walk in the early morning - when the temperature outside is above 40 degrees! The projected time and temperature tell us whether we need to get out of bed - or can sleep in a little longer.  The weather forecasting feature is also useful - and at least as accurate as the TV forecasts

This was a present for my wife. I thought it was pretty cool for her to have the outside temperature and the time projected on the ceiling next to her bed, and for me to never have to reset the clock with daylight saving time.

I received the typical luke warm response when I buy her anything that has the appearance of a gadget. (Men know what I mean; "You really bought this for yourself didn't you" type response)

Well, my wife has even admitted her initial impression was wrong! I was right! (drumroll, fireworks, 21 gun salute, jet fighter overflight)

She loves it. This thing is more useful than a cell phone, fax machine, and a swiss army knife combined.

It works great, does all kinds of things that you would like to know about in the middle of the night and early in the morning (It even provides a halfway decent weather forecast)has a really nice understated look that says what it does without being in your face about it and is in the perfect price range.

If you want to give somebody a nice little gift that will be appreciated every day, this might just be it.

I have had this product for a year now. When I first purchased it, my wife thought it was another of my goofy gadget ideas, but after a few nights with it projecting on the ceiling, she grew to love it. The projected image can be rotated and focused, and even without my glasses, I can read it in the dark (and my eyes aren't that good). It will *not* be visible when the room is lit. It is great to be able to read the current time and remote temperature in the middle of the night when you wake up. 

Out of the box, the radio-sync'd clock easily picked up the remote sensor (for another Oregon Scientific clock we have) on the back porch, and synched to WWV in Colorado within a few minutes. Over the last year, it has performed flawlessly, except for the time when we had to change the batteries on the remote, which required a reset of the "mother ship."

A tip: when you change the batteries on either the remote or the base clock, change both sets. If the unit does not show the temperature after changing the battery, reset it using a paper clip in the reset hole. I also have the LaCrosse projection clock in our other house, and this Oregon Scientific model is a superior product, I believe, to the LaCrosse equivalent

Love the large illuminated time/temp on the ceiling.  Setting up the external temperature sensor was a bit tricky, you'll need to make sure you have a glasses size screwdriver, which I didn't have readily available.  Otherwise everything worked as promised.  I am still not positive if the "atomic" sensor is working.  The instructions said you have to be something like 750 miles (or was it 1000) away from the location in Denver etc.  I am in Detroit so the signal never seemed to sync up, but it may have I am not sure.  All in all a great purchase.

A nifty widget of the highest order. It projects on the ceiling automatically corrected time and outdoor temperature. In addition it tells indoor temperature and weather predictions at least as good as the local weatherman. Most alarms enrage when awakening, this one is very pleasant but persistent if necessary. The instruction manual seems like it was written by someone that had a taxi waiting but you can stumble through to the correct setting in time. I am very happy with this item

I have purchased three of these benches and will be getting two more. They are beautiful to look at and extremely comfortable. They are  well engineered and assemble in less than 15 minutes. I can't comment on how they weather as I've just received them but being cedar they should do well.

I was disappoiinted with the American Woods accessory side tables. They don't have the sturdy and well built look that the benches have. I purchased two, will keep them but not get any more. Stay tuned, I just bought the glider and will write a review after I receive it

I bought this to fill with sands and candles for an indoor area. It creates a cozy and warm addition when we watch movies and sports. The cover is a nice protective from the kids touching the candles. The sand protectes the fire pit from getting to warm.

Since I have started using this unit I have cooked my best Thanksgiving turkey, my best Christmas ham and my best New Year's pork roast ever.  The only reason it's not 5 star is that I've needed the booklet almost every time I've used it.  The controls aren't difficult, but they aren't really intuitive either.  I'd go 4-1/2 stars if I had the option

We were reluctant to buy this product because of some bad reviews we read about it, but we are really glad we decided to buy it!  So far we have not seen one single bug or rodent or spider around!  And believe me, we live in a "mountainy" area so we used to see them around all the time in our garage.  I have not seen them ever since we bought this product.  It is working for us

We have a really bad bug problem (inherited with the trailer when we got it) - these things do work - no bugs in my sisters or mothers houses anymore, but we do still have bugs.  We do move  the 2 units around as recommended - bugs can get use to them.  Also stuff in your house can absorb the noise making them less effective - we are wall to wall stuff with 3 kids in a tiny trailer.  To effectively do our trailer would take 8 - 10 units.  Bugs that we do see are easier to catch and seem disoriented.   These buzzers are best used in wide open spaces with minor to middling bug problems.  The spiders and beetles and moths have totally disappered though.   Our dog hates the things when we move one over by her bed.   So, these units need to be moved every 2-4 weeks.  You need multiple units - 1 for every 200 sq. ft. at least - if you have lots of furniture or smaller rooms, then more - they don't work through walls or furniture.  You need at least one for every room that you have a problem.  It takes 2 - 3 weeks to really start to see results.  Works better if you have fewer bugs - for a really bad bug problem - use in conjunction with other solutions

I was very pleased that this seller emailed me right away when I sent him an email about my concerns that the product might not be exactly what I needed and wanted to cancel the order. He very quickly emailed me and assured me he would cancel and refund my credit card and I was impressed with this service. Gayla Tregr

We had bought one of these for this house, loved it so much we bought one for the other house, too.  The original one was bought w/ the 22" wok, which is gorgeous.  We use both w/ woks and it's kewl.  Easy to break down for travel, too.  Only thing was I shoulda bought the cover for the 22" wok while they were available.  Can't seem to get one now.

This is the best outdoor cooking item I have ever used.  It has very high BTU's and cooks very quickly.  When using it as a wok it takes the grease out of the kitchen that used to linger for days.  We cook all greasy foods outdoors it is extremely fast and the food comes excellent. We use it more than out BBQ.

Wow!  This burner really rocks.  It sounds like a jet engine when you crank it up high.  It really kicks out the heat.  I have had it for 2 days now, and used it both nights for dinner.  Brought a very large pot of corn to boil in no time.  But still had the control to steam crab legs without boiling the water dry.  Very impressed with the range of flame control.  The grid reverses from a bowl shape for woks, to a flat side for pots and pans.  Really nice.  I could not be happier

I have an electric range and a propane bar-b-q.

This burner has been very useful and was the least costly alternative to accomplishing what I wanted to do.

I make 10 qts of salsa wo heating up the kitchen.

A turkey roaster I bought as an accessory really works well with the burner.

My cousin likes to fry potatoes and chicken wings.  This burner can really put out the heat

I set the buner in the backyard, fire it up. The Jet engine equivalence heats up extremely quick, and I finished sauteeding meat/vegie in no time. And they taste great, full of favor.

All I need to do now is building a outdoor kitchen so I don't have to keep moving all the ingredients in and out of the house.

65,000 BTU -- Loud, hot, powerful enough to cook as many French fries as you can cut -- all at once, and keep the oil at 375 degrees effortlessly.  The best fried fish you've ever had, cooked in about 2 minutes.  Fried calamari in about 30 seconds.  Probably the best $49.95 purchase you could make for the kitchen.  (Okay, the warning says to use it outdoors, and to have a fire extinguisher handy.)  Cook with a wok the way it was meant to cook -- get the peanut oil smoking in about 20 seconds.  A bit of a pain to store, and the flame control is rather crude, but man this thing is one hot burner.  Burner ring is reversible to hold woks with the concave ring and a big flat pot (for deep-frying a turkey) with the other side

Very, very happy with this appliance.  I was a bit sceptical before ordering when I read about `stamped metal' but when it arrived, yes it's stamped metal (not every component is, though), but very heavy gauge metal and very well engineered.  I used it immediately after I received it and WOW!  Talk about the `dragon`s breath!'  Very high BTU's and the food cooked like I never have experienced.  Finally, authentic oriental cooking at home.  Highly recommended.
UPDATE:  Well, I've been using this for quite a long time now and I am even more pleased than ever.  I remember asking a Chinese chef in China town how come I can't make food like this at home.  He stated (in a heavy Oriental dialect), "You gotta use hot wok.  Wok gotta be very, very hot!"  Yep, that's the secret.  You will never replicate authentic Oriental cooking on an ordinary gas or electric stove.  "You gotta use hot wok!!" and this devise puts out the BTUs for a very "hot wok" indeed

I purchased 2 of these last year.  There are lots of wooden chairs and other furniture out there but few made with a wood anyone can pronounce.  Since I am a woodworker and live in Oregon, I knew ahead of time I would treat this chair so it will retain its color and last in the rain.  Any type of clear wood deck sealer will do and the TRICK to having a lasting chair is to place a small amount of "liquid nails" in each joint before screwing it all together (this chair does require assembly but it is EZ).  If you seal the wood and secure the joints, this chair should last many years.  I still love mine and they look great and because of the liquid nails...there are no creaks or movement whatsoever so I don't have to worry when my "larger" friends sit in them ;-)...buy them now...they are well worth it!!

My patio is filled with American Woods furniture. Last year, I bought four of these sturdy cedar chairs, as well as a matching table, chaise lounge, and serving cart.

They all still look great, even after enduring two record-breaking wet summmers. However, I do opt to stain them once a year (the manufacturer recommends SuperDeck clear stain), just to keep them looking rich and dark, but you can let them age to a natural gray color, if you prefer.

I researched wood patio furniture thoroughly before going with American Woods products. And while you can find less expensive items, you'd be hard-pressed to find anything that's as sturdy, substantial, and well-built as American Woods. They're built to last, and I know I'll be enjoying my patio furniture for years to come

Just from looking at the picture I can tell that this chair is made from Redwood and is constructed with &quot;Mortice and Tennon&quot; joints. A very solid method of construction. My only hesitation is that there are no measurements given. Plus, if the chair and chair back slats aren't thick enough they will be prone to spliting

Amazon service and Weber quality!  Replaced a few parts on my Weber grill to extend its life.  Moved up to the stainless steel flavor bars and they are terrific; looking for them to last more than the 15 years my porcilin flavor bars did with the same great grilling experience.  My Weber grill is up for more than another 15 years of great grilling

This upgrade is worth every penny.  I agree with the reviewer that felt that heating was more even.  I would add that they seem to burn the drippings off better and keep the inside of the grill cleaner.  There is no doubt in my mind that the addition of this product makes the original design all the better

I have used the fryer for chicken wings which is what I bought it for because I have plenty of parties throughout the year. Along with the professional look of the product, It performs great! If I could give it 10 stars I would. It is the best fryer I have ever used, and that says alot. I would recommend this fryer to anyone looking to enhance their outdoor cooking and bring it to that next "level".

I got my Chia Herb Garden about a month and a half ago and making them grow has been very easy and pleasant. They are still tiny but they are doing good. My advice is to follow the instructions carefully: frequent watering, trimming, full sun or artificial light as explained in the instructions and plant food. Not only they can be used in cooking, they are very decorative and cute

I received this as a Christmas gift last year.  I followed the instructions in January, and by March the sprouts flourished into plants.  By summer, I had repotted all of them twice and they are now HUGE.  My friends are always shocked at the growth of my "basil tree", as they call it.  I owe my success to south-facing windows and religious watering (infused with drops of plant food.)  I don't have a green thumb at all - in fact, I'm a known plant-killer.  But I was able to get the Chia herb garden to grow like a charm.

I wanted this since I didn't trust the humidity reading on my humidifier.  Has large and convienent display.  Due to its size and battery power I can easily move it around the house to check temp/humidity in different rooms

VERY satisfied with the performance of this meter. Have been looking for a Relative Humidity meter for some time that was accurate and durable. The temperature is also included which is great. Price is VERY good for what you get !!

I purchased 4 of these units to track temperature and humidity in a tack room, a woodshop, a boat storage garage, and a craft room that are all located in my horse barn.  Each room has a thermostatically controlled electric wall heater, but the thermostats are not very accurate, therefore I am using these units to assist me with the temperature settings.  I tested all four units together.  The four temperature readings were within a 1 degree range; the four humidity reading were within a 1% range.  The housings are thin plastic and the min/max button has to be depressed hard in order to access the min/max readings in succession.  You will not be happy with these units if you intend to use them as wall instruments in your home, simply because they look and feel cheap.  They are practical --- and you cannot beat the price

This little weather station works well and is pretty simple to set up. You will have to read the instructions to get the remote sensor to sync, but otherwise easy.  I found this to be one of the better looking units from OS. It has medium size numbers and is easy to read.  By reading barometric pressure and outdoor temp and humidity, it does a pretty good job of predicting weather. In order to get outside temp there is a remote sensor.  To be effective you need to mount it in a shady area with a screw.  Also the instructions suggest the more expensive lithium batteries (not included) for the remote sensor because alkaline batteries will only measure temps down to just below freezing, then the batteries freeze. Lithium batteries will allow temp readings all the way down to a chilly -22.  My only disappointment with this unit is the main display is not wall mountable, only desk stand. Also the radio signal for the clock setting comes and goes

I bought two different atomic clock/weather from this company.  both with outside monitors.  It works just as it is supposed to.  One puts the time on the ceiling and the other doesn't.  They both read both the outside monitors like a charm.

some of the buttons are a bit confusing in the dark.  Once I set the alarm by mistake and at 2AM I just had to put the thing in another room.  I could not find the off button

Picked up the time signal within five minutes.  Set your time zone and you're in business.  No more guessing if you have the correct time; no more resetting twice a year for DST. Large display characters are easy to read. Neutral design fits with most any decor. I would have preferred the moon phase colors to be reversed - a full black circle is actually a full moon

Despite the fact that this clock hangs in my basement rec room in Cincinnati, it has had no problem receiving the time signal from Colorado. It should be noted, though, that, as the manual mentions, the proximity of a powered-up TV or computer monitor can interfere with reception of the signal.

As an owner of some expensive acoustic guitars, I find the hydrometer readout very useful for monitoring room humidity. And the readout is big enough to be easily visible from across the room.

I only wish this thing looked a little less purely utilitarian. Big and clunky, two-tone silver, it adds nothing to my room aesthetically.

Living in Florida, we grill almost daily. I seem to burn out a set of enamel grates every 15 months or so. Hopefully, the stainless grates will last much longer.
Without a doubt, the best price for the grates, in store or online, was at AMAZON!!

What is bad to say about these great grates? Uniform heat, easier cleaning than the cheaper porcelain grates, and a great replacement/upgrade for my 4 year old Weber. With these and new flavorizer bars, I plan on many more years of use for this grill. My only wish is that they were a little cheaper on Amazon--price didn't beat local prices by much and only super saver shipping made it a deal

I've been using the stainless steel weber grates for a few weeks now, having replaced the old porcelain ones. I think the heating is quicker, more event, and perhaps even more absorbing for the items on the grill. Not sure if that makes sense, but it seems that the foods seem to heat through adequately in a shorter amount of time without getting overcooked. I do tend to keep the burners down low and turn the cover down on almost everything I cook. I'm a little disappointed that the grates don't stay shiny stainless steel, even in the areas on which I don't lay down foods. I guess that's because of all the heat swirling around when I have the cover closed. All in all, I give this a hearty recommendation

I recently gave my Weber Genesis a facelift with all new parts. While Weber is obviously a quality product Amazon must be commended for bringing these products to the public at reasonable prices.
Prior to this purchase I bought the stainless steel drip bars for my grill at Sears. (ALWAYS get the SS) With a storewide 10% off AND an additional coupon they allowed me to use I still paid 45 cents more than an Amazon purchase.
I only relate this story because I am the last of the online buyers. Resisted this method for years. But Amazon has yet to fail me in the last 6-9 months on any order. And while 45 cents is no big thing it certainly is more convenient to go to the door for a FedEx delivery than shop at Sears. 
So...great product, great price, and great online service. What more can you ask for

With new stainless flavorizer bars and new stainless steel cooking grates, I plan on many more years of use for this grill. My only wish is that they were a little cheaper on Amazon--price didn't beat local prices by much and only super saver shipping made it a deal

I have had a Weber Silver B grill for several years.  The grill is great, but the steel flavorizor bars rust and have to be replaced (I replaced my bars twice in five years).  I have just started using the SS bars, but I am sure they will be better than the old bars, and well worth the extra initial cost.  If I had been able to get the SS bars earlier (not usually available from local markets), I probably would not have had to replace the bars as I did (twice).  I highly recommend spending the extra dollars for SS bars when the originals fall apart

After having my Silver B for 7 years, the origional porcelin bars were very rusty. My grill would flare up terribly. I thought it might be from the rust holding the drippings and grease and making the flares worse. I was right! These stainless units (the length is listed wrong here) are great! I just cooked brauts without a flare up! Price was great; thanks Amazon

I'm not sure quite what to say about the burners.  As expected, they work extremely well, and they were rather easy to install.  The only problem I had was with a bolt that had rusted and required a little time to get off.  Beyond that, I had my grill lit within 15 minutes of taking the burners out of the box

If you are expecting a HUGE Chiminea, then move on.  But if you want a medium sized one that is easy to assemble and good looking then this is the item for you.  It took about 10 minutes to put together with two people (and I am not mechanically inclined) and it feels very solid, not flimsy or cheap.  It is probably about 30 lbs.  I used one half of a Duraflame (fake fire log) in this chiminea the first time I used it and I was glad I did.  The burning area is kind of small and if I had used a full log I would have had an inferno!  Even with the small log, the flames lept out of the unit a bit so keep it away from anything flammable.  Maybe regular wood/sticks would work better I don't know, I have yet to try that.
Overall, I am happy with the item because it is a nice convenient size, works well and looks very nice

I purchased this product mainly for steaming blue crabs which,throughout the summer, we trap in the river in front of our house. For years I have steamed them in a pot on the stove and the steam and odor filled the house. Using this pot outside provided a welcome relief with the added benefit of being much easier to clean than the enamel steamer I used on the stove.  It is very easy to use and it is just the right size for an average haul of crabs. I have never fried a turkey but I just might try it

nice stand, paint has faded a bit after a year being stored outside exposed to the elements, but isn't peeling or exposing any metal.  There are 3 segments, they all fit together easily and are reinforced to prevent breakage or bending, but they're freely attached.  So if you need to move your hammock stand you'll need 2 people unless you push it, if you pull it, one of the angled arms will slide out of the horizontal bar.  You could probably fix this yourself by drilling a hole through the bottom (horizontal) bar and into one of the arms to screw in a bolt, but the steel is very thick, about 3/16&quot; or 1/4&quot; thick

After 2 tries finally got it; my wife ordered it for me(to go w/matching hammock) and after a month Amazon had to credit her cc because UPS sent it back due to damage. I order it and get in 2 weeks.It's easy to assemble/disassemble. If you buy it go out and get 2"S" hooks mine were missing(seems other reviewers had same issue). I did call their 800# and was happily accomodated by the pleasant operator who apologized and is sending out the hooks. I still give it high ratings based on easy assemble. I can't wait for my hooks--going out to see if I can find some today so I can enjoy it w/our 16mth old son

Carbon steel like cast iron does need to be seasoned. But once it's done it's very non-stick.
An easy way to season:
Scrub the cookware using a green scrub pad and scouring powder.
Rinse well and wash with regular dishwashing liquid. Rinse again.
Dry in a 325F oven for about 20 mins. If you like, cool it a bit to make it easier to handle, but make sure to continue to the next step while the cookware is still warm to the touch.
Coat the inside and outside of the cookware with a good coat of vegetable oil--not so heavy it's dripping everywhere, but more than a thin coat. Of course use caution with the hot cookware. Put it on a few old towels and use a paper napkin saturated with oil to coat the pan. 
Bake upside down at 325F for 45min-60mins. You might want to put Al foil on the rack below the cookware to catch any excess oil that drips.
Repeat coating  the warm cookwarw and baking at least one more time. A third time is great.
After the final coat of oil is done, turn off the oven and let the cookware cool in the oven.
The cookware should now have darkened with a subtle sheen. The finish will be rock hard and smooth--not sticky at all.
Treat it well. I DO use diluted dishwashing detergent and a scruber to clean my cast iron and have never had a problem with the seasoning coming off. Just don't let it sit soaking in water for a long time. It will still rust. I let some friends borrow my lodge dutch oven for a campout. They let it soak overnight and scraped it to clean it and didn't dry it out well--the seasoning was chipped off. It came back rusted! So, I just had to scrub it out to remove the rust and redo the seasoning... It came back almost as before, except for the pitting caused by the rust--however, this is just a cosmetic thing. It still works fine.
Depending on how often you use the item, you can give it a touch up seasoning... just make sure it's clean and dry before giving it an oil coat and baking and cooling

I found the 16" LaCrosse Atomic Clock to be exactly as described.  The metal case is sturdy and good looking; the directions very straight-forward.  16" is big.  Be sure you want this diameter.  They make smaller units.  I am quite satisfied with my purchase

The back panel broke when taking it out of package, that is the packaging though not the clock.  It is in working order and keeps one 'on time'

After having trouble with a different atomic clock, I decided to try again.  I chose the LaCrosse Atomic clock after reading other reviews from customers and searching online.  Overall, it's been great.  I was able to quickly set it up in my office; the instructions are simple and easy to follow.  My office is in a NYC commercial building, mostly made of mortar and brick with a steel frame.  Initially, I did not receive the signal in the day.  But the instructions pointed out that the signal is strongest at night, and the clock would most likely set at night.  Sure enough, the next morning, it was correctly set (even with the earlier daylight savings time).  I've found the black background with white numbers particularly easy to read from a distance.  My only concern was the same as that of other customers: Amazon packed it poorly, and the inner box holding the clock was totally free to bounce around in the outer box.  Fortunately, the outer box protected it enough, and the clock arrived unscathed.  Overall, I consider myself lucky, given the condition of many boxes delivered to my office building.  Otherwise, this is a nice, accurate, easy to read clock with a sense of style, as well

So it's not a big deal to reset your clocks when the time changes and when the power goes out, right? Well... yes it is. As I get older and technology becomes more demanding and time consuming, the fact that I can have ONE DEVICE that takes care of itself has become fairly important to me. It's just a clock, but... it works. Which is more than I can say for my fax or copier or phone or... I always get LaCross because I like the looks of their stuff. Be good to yourself- upgrade to Atomic

I ordered this clock, and then had to send it back two times before it finally arrived undamaged (actually, minimally damaged). The first two times the glass was cracked and broken. By the third time, all that was the matter was minor dent marks in the metal frame where the packaging must have pressed down on it (this is only noticeable in certain light angles). The shipping problems weren't the manufacturers fault though, as Amazon did the packing and shipping. It'd be nice if they maybe put a big "Don't stack things on top of this box" sticker or something on the box so that it didn't get damaged. Or, bubble wrap, remember that stuff?! Those airbags just ain't cuttin' it. 
On the clock itself, I love it. I kept it despite the minor denting b/c it has been discontinued by the manufacturer, and it's the largest atomic clock I could find that didn't have some ugly antique-ish design. The second hand actually ticks, instead of fluidly moving, which is a nice touch. It was easy to set up, and it's big and easy to read. It reminds of the clocks all over my high school (in a good way). All in all, very happy with the actual clock, very dissatisfied w/ Amazon's shipping and packing of it

This clock is great.  It's really modern looking and I love the black face.  I have this in my kitchen and it looks great.  There is a second hand which is invaluable in any kitchen.  The fact that it's an atomic clock is super because it means that I never have to reset it for daylight savings time because it resets itself automatically.  Shortly after you plug in the battery, the clock starts setting itself to the atomic clock and that's kind of fun.  Keeps precise time

A local news station in our area aires a commentary piece that ask the question, "does it really do that?", as it relate to product advertisements.  A news team member goes out to investigate the product to determine whether or not it really does do what it's advertised to do. Then the reality of the item is disclosed durig the commentary.  Well, News Team...if you're listening...save your time and money, take it from me, the LaCross Atomic Clock really does do that..all that it's advertised to do...and more. Three things that I particularly enjoy; the fact that It automatically sets itself according to the time zone, the numbers...white...are boldly displayed and help you to accurately read the time from a distance, and that it's precise in maintaining the time.

This clock works great!  It automatically picks up the accurate time through radiowave.  It did not come with a product manual but easy to figure out.  All you have to do is selct your time zone button (PT, MT, CT, and ET) and put a new AA battery.  I agree with another review which mentioned that this clock is not made for durable construction. As a matter of fact, when I picked up the clock from the package, a tiny screw came off.  It was one of the screws to hold back body panel to the main body.  It has not affected to the function as well as the visual part, anyway, so it may not a big deal.  Overall, this clock is good enough for the price

This is our 3rd addition to the Lafuma XL model, we also have 2 regular Lafuma models.  This is the most comfortable chair and we camp every weekend and everyone fights over these chairs.  The XL model is great for my family because we are all 6ft tall or more and the width has more room too.  Highly recommend

The new burner's work great, good as new!
Only problem was removing old burners.  The screws that hold the ends in place were rusted in place.  I had to drill them out, and replace the screws.
But all fine now..much cheaper than buying new grill

Excellent quality, functional, and flexible. Extra long handle lets me reach across the heat without getting burned.  The rubber grip was a nice touch, and the replaceable brush heads are unique.  This comes with 3 brush heads, and after those are used up you can get them for under $2.00 each. This is a very solid, well-built tool that is built to last. I highly recommend this.

I am thrilled with this purchase. I had initially ordered 4 chairs and the companion dining table. Upon its delivery, I went back and ordered another pair of chairs. They are very comfortable, generously proportioned, their overall styling very beautiful to the eye. I have subsequently received many compliments on this set. I just wish they sold a larger matching table. 

I plan on ordering the companion loveseat

Many times I have thought that Amazon hired people to rave in these reviews but I cannot say enough about how nice this furniture is!
I bought 4 chairs, the settee, and b/c they don't have a side table in the Bainbridge pattern I bought the Shaw table with the ice pit.
I have recommended these to everyone, lol, the price has gone up $10 every week for the past 2 weeks.....get em while their hot

We are delighted with our new chairs and table.  The products were well-packed and came in excellent condition.  The chairs are sturdy, ample and comfortable even without the cushions.  The cushions that come with are very nice, but too thick for my liking.  The chairs have an additional feature of leveling pads on the bottom of each leg that can be screwed in or out to accommodate uneven surfaces.  The table is big enough for a full dinner for four, but small enough to still feel intimate. We now spend a lot more time on our patio

As an Interior Designer I was very pleased with the quality of these patio chairs.  I liked everything about them, even the cushions were thick and comfy enough for even the heaviest of my guests.  I have other Sunbrella cushions that are way to thin to be comfortable throughout a meal - these cushions let you sit and eat for hours

Good enough for me, but I like to tinker with things. Has been running continuously for over 3 years, have replaced the batteries a few times, they dont last forever but the power drain is reasonable. It has survived 3 hurricanes, none were a direct hit but it has recorded wind speeds of 83 MPH. After about 2 1/2 years of operation the anemometer stopped working, knowing it was out of warranty I pried it open and found the magnet it uses to trigger the wind speed sensor had rusted and fallen out. I glued another ring magnet in with 3M 5200 RTV (Killer Stuff By The Way) and it is running like a champ. This item is about $[...] to $[...] less than the Oregon Scientific WMR-968 and it comes with the software and cable you need to connect it to your PC it is a super deal, you can spend $[...] to $[...] connecting your Oregon Scientific unit to your PC. After setup and calibration all you need to send your weather data to the Internet is a program called WUHU (Weather Underground HeavyWeather Updater) and an account at Weather Underground, check my weather at wunderground.com Station Number KFLROCKL4. For the money I cant beat it, I wish I had a Davis but I cant justify the expense, maybe when I win the Lotto..

I am quite pleased with my lunchbox.  It is the perfect size, yet is not obtrusive in design, shape, or capacity.  I would recommend to others.

This is a great "little" lunch box and I stress the word LITTLE. The way the bag is made if you put a medium or large bowl in it, when you carry it by the handle, you are carrying the bowl on it's side, which is ok if you are sure you secured the lids, but then when you go around the corner fast and it falls off the seat you start to wonder, did i really close the lid on the bowl right? sorry, i got of track there. Anyway, I use this daily and it does keep things cold and has two outer pockets that are great for utensils, napkins, gum and small things. Also, I have been using for over 3 months and it is quite durable.
A great bag if you're only going to put a little yogurt, one or two little bowls (like no bigger than 9 oz) and a piece of fruit and maybe a sandwich if you don't mind it smushed.
I'm actually shopping for a new bag now that is bigger to allow me to have cold drinks at work all day now that we are getting close to warmer weather

This is a great device.  It fits with what I read about performing automatically a couple of things that beginners have trouble with.  In my case I had lost my wedding ring in the yard while raking leaves.  The long story resulted in a happy end when, after wondering if the device really worked after an hour of frustration, I tried a different area I KNEW that the ring could not possibly be - and the device went off LOUD AND CLEAR - and there the ring was!  I am quite happy that the automatic adjustments make it an excellent beginner metal detector

As a low cost metal detector I give this thing five stars. I bought this Detector several months back and enjoy it's relative ease of use, and it DOES find what you are searching for (coins, rings, earings, necklaces, etc). The other reviews here pretty much wrap it up as a good (affordable!) unit, but I wanted to make a few comments from an amateur's point of view:

- This detector has, of course, the discrimination circuitry used to tell the difference between the various metals helping you to avoid digging up junk like soda can pull tabs which are everywhere. It does work pretty good, BUT - I have found that by using the Tracker IV discriminator, you will most likely be missing some good stuff. I have gone back over "Discriminated" areas again in "All Metal" mode and found some nice stuff that Discriminate didn't catch. Granted I am no pro, but the fact is if you want to get every coin, every ring, or every cool item of various metals, you may want to consider just using "All Metal" mode. I almost exclusively use it now and although I sift through some absolute junk. I have found a bunch of coins, necklaces, pendants, etc that I would have otherwise missed. Use the Discriminate mode when looking for that gold wedding ring your wife through at you in the back yard...

- Invest in the 4 inch "Gold Nugget Coil" which is far superior at pinpointing metal. The stock coil works fine but is a tad ambiguous as to precisely where your coin, ring, (or pull tab) is. The smaller coil reduces search time and I am glad I have one.

- I bought the recommended Bounty Hunter Headphones (to save battery power), but have found them to be a bit more trouble than help. When I detect something I squat or sit down and dig. I set the detector down so the coil is near the dig zone so I can waive clumps of dirt (or sand) in front of the coil as I search. The problem is the headphone's wire tends to be always in the way when I perform this move. I get tired of "untangling" so I don't use them anymore. Maybe I'm just getting old.

- The meter is of no value for anyone who can hear the audible report. It has no "range" to judge metals you are passing over. It simply swings hard to the right no matter what from what I can tell. I have tried different modes and different metals to test it, but it seems to merely swing hard to the right as you pass over any type of metal / alloy. I can see how this would still be useful to a deaf person, but it just as easily could have been a bright light bulb instead of a meter. I won't ding this low cost detector for that though because I'd still dig if it was half scale or pegged.

- And lastly a warning. If you go into a park, or any area attended by kids, you will be spotted. Within a short amount of time you will be surrounded by kids "helping you" to dig up buried treasure. At that point you have to decide whether to be a meanie and bark at them, or write the rest of the hunt off and let them shred the area every time the detector beeps. I generally tell them how it's been a long day and "see ya" since they will invariably have their hands in there digging away no matter what you say...

I bought this as a complete novice to the sport?? of metal detecting.  I bought it with the intention of locating a few property stakes and maybe finding some valuable treasures in my yard.  To date I have found neither.  I would chalk this up to my inexperiece and to the fact that I have not gotten out and used it nearly as much as I imagined I would.  Everything I have read about this particular detector indicated it was an introductory model that works reasonably well.  I would agree

I am satisfied with this item. I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend and did not want to spend too much incase metal detecting was just a 'phase'! It is easy to use and beeps at the first sign of metal! We've mostly dug up ring pulls from cans and a few cents here and there. We've had no problems with it. He's used it a number of times and the batteries show no sign of running out yet.
Metal detecting is fun and this detector would make a great gift for 8-16 year olds, or anyone just starting out their interset in metal detecting

I'm pretty happy with this detector, it works really well.  I just wish I could turn the volume down.  The beep is ear-piercing.  I started using headphones with it, so now I have the pleasure of ear-piercing beeps even closer to my ear drum.  This was purchased to help find a lost item in the backyard, so it would have been nice to have the option of turning it down, for the neighbors sake

I picked one of these up several months back and have been very satisfied with its performance.... The coil is waterproof and can be used in shallow water, wet soil or sand which makes this a great beach detector. It's okay and recommended to drag the coil along the ground back and forth SLOWLY for maximum depth. It runs on only 2 9-volt batteries which by using headphones you can really extend the life of. While it doesn't have any visual target windows like more expensive detectors, the two-tone audio speaker is the key to determining what kind of metal you've found. You can literally turn this thing on and go! There's only 2 dials of operation to worry about "all metal" (a 10 o'clock setting is good) and it can be used in concert with the "discrimination" dial (11 o'clock is good here) to eliminate iron and other junk metals. It's simple enough for a child to use and understand.... To save the prospective buyer some trouble, read the manual carefully and practice around your house and yard before taking this into the field --- trust me. This is an ideal first detector for someone who isn't sure they'll like this hobby and don't want to spend lots of money to find out. Bounty Hunter also offers a 5-year limited warranty which shows you that they really stand behind their product. RESEARCH is the key to making good finds though, so don't expect great results without it! Read and learn all you can about your local area's history to improve your odds of success. Metal detecting has something big in common with real estate --- location, location, location is the key!

The Bounty Hunter is an excellent value for the person who loves to scour about an area that was lush with people ie.(company picnic, family reunion).  The Hunter is easy to use and is lightweight. The instructions are clear and concise in describing the difference between a rusty nail and a piece of jewerly. This is my first Bounty Hunter, and I've already recommended it to my friends

I purchased two chairs at first to test out the quality.  I had been looking for a Wrought Iron patio set but I didn't want to pay the high prices I was finding.  I really liked the chairs so I went ahead and ordered the WHOLE set!  2 loungers, love set, sofa, coffee table, side tables, and 2 more chairs.  Honestly, I love the set!  It's not your best quality but for the price I'm more then satisfied.  They are heavy pieces but not so heavy you can't move them around.  I had an issue with the sofa so I filled out the online return form and I'm telling you I have NEVER experienced the service I have received from Amazon.  They processed a new order at NO COST TO ME and they will pick up the defective one when they deliver the new one.  How great is that.  Even Costco makes you purchase the new item first and then they will credit you once they receive the old item back!  I order a lot online and I have to say Amazon has a great system

I've been looking for something like this for a long time.  This product has plenty of room in it for the tree that I have.  Unfortunately, it has no structure to it so it's very flimsy and makes transporting the tree somewhat difficult.  The fact that you've made something that replaces the original product packaging is very helpful though.  I'll give you an A+ for the concept and a B for the product design

We've used artificial Christmas trees for years and every year we've taken off the ornament, etc and broken the tree down for storage.  This year we ordered the Christmas Tree Bag.  This year, we took off the stand and set the entire tree, ornaments and all in the bag.  Only about a foot of the "trunk" stuck out after zipping up.  Where has this bag been all these years?  Next year we'll unzip, put on the stand, and set up the tree.  Plug in the lights and away we go

I love the storage bag. It was large enough for my 7 1/2ft. tree. I haven't had any problems with it. It's sturdy. I didn't like the fact that the shipping and handling is almost as much as the storage bag

I wish it reached farther, but when within range a nice satellit

The sensor works very well however, since it is an outdoor sensor, it should be waterproof. It is not. It must be placed where the rain will not fall on it

I read some reviews that there were some compatability issues with this sensor and the main unit. However, I had no trouble at all getting this sensor to work with my existing unit and sensor, once I realized I need to reset the main unit in order for it to recognize the newest sensor. I have one sensor outside in my garage and the other downstairs in my basement and they both work well and are pretty accurate with the actual temperature. This was an excellent purchase

I've been using metal detectors for around 5 years now. My first detector was a Bounty Hunter QuickDraw II, a very fine, easy to learn detector that's a real workhorse. I learned most everything I know about metal detecting from personal experience and from reading lots of posts and asking lots of questions at the Bounty Hunter Forum http://www.detecting.com 

I shopped around and found the Bounty Hunter Land Ranger as a factory shipped model (no extras except 4" and 8" coil) for $337. For that price, I couldn't afford not to buy it! 

When the Land Ranger (LR) arrived, it was in 3 pieces and extremely easy to assemble. The manual that comes with the LR gives you the basic information you need to get started detecting with the LR, but is a bit general when it comes to explaining what each of the functions do. 

If you just want a "Turn On and Go" detector, the Land Ranger may not be for you. If this is the case, I would recommend getting an easier to learn detector such as the Bounty Hunter QuickDraw II or even the Bounty Hunter Tracker IV. Should you later decide to get the Land Ranger, your first detector will make an excellent back-up detector and a great detector for a friend or family to use with you. What I would recommend is going to the Bounty Hunter Forum website listed above to learn, way more, information about various detectors and their various functions than I could ever begin to explain here. 

Even though I had been detecting for a while, my first trip out with the Land Ranger was quite overwhelming and somewhat frustrating due to the much greater sensitivity of this model, the added features it has and an the information overload of tones responding to mineralized ground conditions, trashy areas (many pulltabs, screwcaps etc.) and a condition know as "falsing" (tones due mostly to incorrect "Sensitivity" settings and improper Ground Balancing). The initial experience that I describe here is very common with first time Land Ranger users and is frustrating, but will get much better with practice and with the more one learns about detecting in general and about the Land Ranger in particular. 

As I use the Land Ranger now, I have learned much about settings, what to ignore and what to watch for to indicate which targets may be worth digging. Once past the information overload (that will happen, I assure you), the user will begin to appreciate the sensitivity of this detector, learn the proper settings, begin finding more and more valuable items (or targets as they are called) and become one with this detector. 

I purchased the Bounty Hunter Land Ranger for it's very sophisticated microprocessor features including - Target Id, VDI (numeric) readout indicating target conductivity, 3 Tone ID, it's automatic & manual Ground Balancing, Programmable Target Accept/ Reject, All Metals, No Motion/ Pinpoint mode, Self Tuning (Motion) All Metals Mode (good for deep hunting of Relics, Caches and/or gold nugget shooting) ... And ... for the reputation of Bounty Hunter Detectors ... but MAINLY for the excellent price of such a full featured, professional metal detector. 

I love being able to put this baby to work discriminating out trash items while ringing in sharp and clear when locating coins and jewelry. The Land Ranger is also ideal for hunting Relics and for (gold) nugget shooting, although I have not done much of either of these yet (soon, I hope). I also love the fact that two coils (standard 8" and 4" nugget coil) come stock with the Land Ranger and I also have a 10" coil that I purchased for around $60. (it's important to have several coil sizes available for various types of hunting) The price of additional coils for many other brands of detectors is astronomical, so this was an integral part of my decision to get a Bounty Hunter rather than some other brands. 
I love how lightweight this detector is. I love knowing that I have a sophisticated detector that will not miss items that are buried deep. (how deep depends on the size of object, type of metal, soil conditions etc) Generally, the LR will detect to a depth of around 10"-12" deep for a coin sized target. (believe me, you won't want to dig too many objects THAT deep, most targets are right around 4"-6" deep, due to how coins, jewelry etc. tend to migrate down into the soil, this varies, of course, but in general, a greater number of objects are somewhere in this depth range. 

What I hate about the Land Ranger is that parts of the manual give a very general description of certain features like the ground monitor meter or self tuning all metals mode. I wish that the Land Ranger were waterproof or at least water resistant ... 
it is not, and I highly recommend that you do not use it in the rain without a good plastic cover that fits securely around the control housing. 

In Conclusion: 

I highly recommend the Land Ranger for any seasoned detectorist ... or for a novice detectorist that is willing to devote a good deal of time and a fair amount of patience to mastering the many nuances of this full featured detector. The Land Ranger hosts Target ID, (VDI) Numeric Readout, 3 Tone ID, Depth Meter, Battery Meter, Ground Monitor Meter, Sensitivity meter and Target indicator. It has Touchpad controls for Sensitivity, Accept/ Reject Discrimination, All Metals - No Motion/ Pinpoint mode, 3 Factory Preset modes, All Metals (Motion) Self Tuning mode and for Smart Trac Automatic and Manual Ground Balancing. 

It's a handful, but a great full featured unit for a very reasonable price. 5 stars ... Highly Recommended if you are willing to devote some time and patience in learning it's traits and harnessing it's potential, once you do, you'll absolutely love it, I know I do!

We Love it! Best purchase I have made in a long time! At first I thought it was a little too much to spend on a metal detector...  This is in the middle range and very easy to use. I bought it as a family project, something we all could do. In the first 3 months of purchasing it we have found 3 diamond rings, 2 gold watches, a bracelet, gold necklace and several old and valuable coins that date back to as early as 1890. Also it's a great hobbie and money maker. Worth every cent!! Don't forget to get the headphones---a MUST!!! Get it for a Christmas 2004 gift, your gift will keep them busy and keep giving back all year long

First off the picture is all wrong. The tools are just like the ones in the "Mr. Bar-B-Q 5-Piece Oval Stainless Handle Tool Set" except you also get the plastic case, scraper, 8 corn holders, and 4 knives, not the wooden ones shown in the picture. It comes with the XXXL spatula and tongs. I mean these thing are HUGE in every sense of the word. Its a nice set for the price. I would have like a smaller spatula and tongs like the ones shown, they are almost too big but I am sure this will last a long time, the tools look quite durable. Good buy, but just be aware what you are actually buying

I ordered one, but would like to know if on the last review if that is salt water or fresh and what kind of luck, and on the other update on further finds, as for the other review just find Google and type in Bounty Hunter and the name of the detector and you'll find all of that then knock it down to the best buy and or support which ever is important to you, I bought a detector when I was 13 by picking strawberries all summer I am 30+ years past that and I had a blast until I sat on it :&lt; , I want that fun back! I know im kinda turning this into a Blog but its important for things left unsaid and more helpful for those checking it out for the first time

Bought this as an open box.  What a great detector for the money.  I had it out of the box and up and running in 5 mins.  Very easy setup!!  Took it to the back yard and found 3 pennies in the first 10 mins (one was a wheat penny).  The LCD correctly displayed them as a pennies.  As this was my first time detecting, the unit seems very easy to use.  An excellent choice for those wanting a feature filled detector at a bargin price

I purchased this table to replace my second broken glass top table that broke during a storm as a result of the wind.  I will never buy a glass top patio table again.  This table is especially lovely to look at and fit in perfectly with my chairs and umbrella.  Looks like it all came together.  Had to learn my lesson about glass.  I wish it was a couple inches bigger but it's really just fine

I was really pleased with the quality of this patio table.  It was shipped immediately and we received it in less than 5 days after ordering.  As others have commented, the instructions and screws furnished with the table were not for the table I ordered.  I had to buy additional screws at Home Depot, four in total.  The missing instructions, for the table ordered, were not really needed, it was simple enough to put together without instructions.  All tools needed were included with the shipment.  Had I not needed to purchase additional screws, I would have given this product 5 STARS

This is a very nice looking and sturdy table.  A nice extra is they ship a small bottle of touch-up paint with the product.

The table may look nice now, but getting there was a pain in the neck.  On the positive side - it is very well packaged.  No worries about any damage during transport - not a small issue for many items.

That said, the instruction sheet included was for a different (rectangular) table with completely different legs.  Even if it was for the same table, it was in that hard-to-understand translated-into-English-using-a-dictionary vocabulary.  There was a nicely vacuum packed card with all of the bolts and washers, as well as an appropriate wrench that fit the bolts.  Unfortunately, there were 12 bolts in two sizes and 12 washers - but 16 holes waiting for bolts in the table.  All of the bolts were too long for any of the holes - even with the washers.

I ended up getting a bunch of extra washers and few shorter bolts at my local hardware store (if you need to do this make sure you get stainless steel so rust will not be a problem).  The bolts provided required between 3 and 4 washers each before they could be adequately tightened.

Whew - finally done.  The table is serving us well on the patio.  It replaces a glass topped model which flipped over and shatterred in a big wind last fall.  The open weave design is nice - very easy to clean the top.  Give me a couple of months to get over the trauma of assembly and I might give it 5 stars

I just received this table cover and am very pleased. This is a high quality  product: the material is heavy and lined with waterproof rubber and the construction is superior, with double sewn seams and heavy-duty hand grips. A much better product than I have seen for similar prices in local stores

I have an oval table that seats six.  The chairs are both stationary and swivel style.  This fits the set perfectly.  Nice durable canvas fabric, handles to pull to the sides, straps to anchor cover to furniture set.  Only negative is it has pull straps to tighten the cover along the bottom, however, the canvas does not move well enough to really pull it taut.  Great value, though

This clock is very simple and clean.  I had no problem getting mine to work.  I had to leave it overnight to get the signal and they all set.  One has walls blocking the western direction, and it sometimes loses the signal, so I just leave it out overnight at a better location and put it back.

Overall, I really like this clock

My husband and I got these headphones for his 9-year old son who lives in Ocala, Florida. He loves them. They aren't too heavy, and really allow him to listen carefully. When a 9-year old can concentrate on something for longer than five minutes, you know it's a good product! They took some getting used to, but after three weeks, he's doing very well, and doesn't even notice that he has them on

I have had this for 1 month now and I love it. It does record the outdoor and indoor temp. You can change the display to either show both or only indoor with an expanded clock. We had owned another la crosse clock that is beamed onto the ceiling at night (also great!) and we did not have to set up another outdoor senser. Both clocks work off of the one to display the outdoor temp. Never have to worry about being late because of a clock loosing time. It is updated every 24 hours. I Love it

I got this burner for home brewing beer at the recommendation of one of the homebrew forums I read regularly.  The box arrived in a little bit rough shape, but everything worked great. Very easy to use, just hook up to a propane tank similar to the way you hook up a gas grill.  

It generates a lot of heat! This is a mixed blessing as it gets a good boil going, but I found it a little bit difficult to control the heat (getting it to slow down enough to not over boil).  

For my own use, I run it with the lowest amount of air/gas available (lowest flame), but if you are in need of serious heat or doing some serious outdoor cooking this burner does the job!

Pros:  Lot of flame, easy to use, easy to setup.
Cons: Little difficult to control the heat as the lowest setting still runs a bit hot

This is truly a high pressure very hot burner; the amount of heat that this is capable of producing is nothing short of amazing.  If you want to heat or boil a large quantity of water or frying oil, it is too hot for small pots, this burner will do the job.

This remote temperature sensor works in conjunction with the base unit and permits you to monitor the outdoor temp and humidity as well as the indoor temp, anywhere in your house. I keep the base unit in my bedroom and can then tell both the outdoor temp and the lower level indoor temps when getting dressed for the day. I think the system works very well for a reasonable cost

I've used this, along with the base station, for one year now.  I've monitored temp and humidity inside, outside, and in my RV parked in my driveway.  Works great.  Easy to use, easy to change the batteries.  Despite the instructions, you can use rechargable batteries.  They read low on the display, but work just fine.

We already have the base unit for this product and have previously added another sensor which worked so well, that we have now added a third sensor.  In addition, we have bought the base unit as gifts and have now bought additional sensors for those that we bought the base unit for.  We like to be able to check the temperature in our motorhome, especially during the winter, as well as the garage, attic, etc. My husband moves the sensors to other locations from time to time and has been very impressed with the whole system

I have two of these,one in my bedroom and one outside. They work great. I also have one simular to this one except it has a 4 ft external temp sensing wire that can be used for a pool or freezer. I use mine in a freezer in my shed 150 ft away. All three send a signal back to a small base unit in my living room that I monitor daily. I lost power to my shed last week. If not for the temp sensor in the freezer reading 20 degrees I probably would have had a lot of food spoil. If these sensors ever go bad I will get new units.

I did a lot of research and if you follow directions , it is safe and fun.
It takes about 25 min to heat the oil and 45 minutes to cook an 11 lb. turkey. The pot has a maximum oil level mark and that was the correct amount for our bird. The turkey must be dried well to prevent spattering. Watch the oil temp. so it does not go over 350. Do it outdoors as the paint has to burn off the burners and it smells.

I gave this grill thermometer to my dad for Father's Day. It works perfect when he wants to sear fish and steaks too. It's easy to remove from the grill too. I would recommend this item to anyone who does a lot of searing or wants to know the surface temperature of their grill. You can use this for a griddle or an indoor grill on your stove too.

I've had this unit for almost 3 years.  It works great. I installed it per manufacturers recommendations.  I was careful with it to not damage it.  The software is great for communication via internet.  I have found the measurements to be very accurate.  I would buy this again.  I'm sure the competition has nice units too.  But I really like how this one works.  The rain guage works great.  What I'd really like is a snow guage

I have had the WS-2310 for 3 months, and I must say that it has been a pleasure to use. For what you get, it's an excellent value - and I have found it reliable and a joy to use. 

That said, I echo the comments about the wireless features, and installed my unit as a wired system. I wanted to avoid having to change batteries on sensors mounted in difficult to reach areas. I also found out that the system, particularly the rain sensor, is RF sensitive. As a Ham Radio operator, I found a 10 watt 2M transmitter 15 feet away caused errant readings. To solve this, I did two things, I moved the 2M antenna and I added several wraps on ferrite cores for the telephone cables that connect the sensors and the main unit. 

After reading the documentation on the Heavy Weather software supplied with the unit, I decided I was looking for a more complete package and purchased Weather Display. This interfaced perfectly with my WS-2310, and has resulted in a reliable and accurate system. You can see my weather system online at http://bwusa.homeip.net:14501/info.html. I also feed data to WeatherUnderground and other systems. 

In all, there is no doubt that there are more rugged systems available, but they are far more expensive, which would have made my project impossible

I wanted a glass hummingbird feeder and decided to try this one on my window before springing for some of the more glamorous-looking blown glass ones. I mounted it on my kitchen window, under an awning on the northeast side of the house, not at all expecting anything to happen. A ruby-throated hummingbird found it the very first day!

It took some force at first to separate the mounting bracket thing from the feeder itself. In fact, I had to drop it first for it to break loose and detach! Fortunately, nothing broke. I probably could have just soaked it in some hot soapy water and it would have come apart easily.

You can't beat glass. I'm just totally getting away from plastic these days...

I have been buying plastic hummingbird feeders that attach to the window so I can have an up-close view of my favorite birds.  I found this wonderful GLASS feeder that will not deteriorate and get brittle (I had to replace the plastic ones every year).  I was concerned that it would be too heavy, but the suction cups are very effective, and the feeder was accepted immediately by all the hummingbirds.  Right now there is snow on the ground, temperatures below freezing at night, and I still have a faithful hummer visiting every day when it gets warm enough for him (her?) to move around.  GREAT PRODUCT

My sister gave this to me at Christmas and I kept it out on the counter all winter in hopes of an early spring!!! I put all my feeders out the first of May and seen my first hummer the 2nd...hope they will find this one on my window...they are so neat to sit and watch.
Make your own nectar to use in your feeder...I use a funnel works great to fill feeders

I purchased this table to replace my second broken glass top table that broke during a storm as a result of the wind.  I will never buy a glass top patio table again.  This table is especially lovely to look at and fit in perfectly with my chairs and umbrella.  Looks like it all came together.  Had to learn my lesson about glass.  I wish it was a couple inches bigger but it's really just fine

I was really pleased with the quality of this patio table.  It was shipped immediately and we received it in less than 5 days after ordering.  As others have commented, the instructions and screws furnished with the table were not for the table I ordered.  I had to buy additional screws at Home Depot, four in total.  The missing instructions, for the table ordered, were not really needed, it was simple enough to put together without instructions.  All tools needed were included with the shipment.  Had I not needed to purchase additional screws, I would have given this product 5 STARS

This is a nice addition to anyone's patio. The product came very well packaged in heavy duty double boxes with the legs wrapped in padded paper. Assembly took around 30 minutes. As others have commented the holes don't line up naturally and did require some "finessing" in order to get lined up, but really wasn't that difficult to overcome. All that is required for assembly is a 4mm allen wrench which is provided (although the end started to get worn 1/2 way through the assembly and required me to use another wrench). Probably one of the nicest features of the table are adjustable levelers on the legs. This seems like a good quality that I am confident will last for many years to come

An amazing little grill. With 8 charcoal briquettes, I cooked a couple of salmon-burgers on it for lunch, then put on two Cornish Game hens, put on the cover, let them bake for an hour, and had them later for dinner.   NOTE: DON'T PEAK under the lid when using this grill as an oven. The heat escapes and it takes awhile to build it back up. Instead, use your nose & ears.   

An excellent little grill for camping, picnics, and emergencies. Since it uses so little fuel, you can do a great deal of cooking with a single bag of charcoal. Don't use lighter fluid, use a small "starter stick" to start the coals.

We received one of these chairs as a gift from our daughter several years ago.  It has been a great conversation piece, besides being a very comfortable chair.  The grandkids argue over who's turn it is to use it.  It is very relaxing to sit in it on the patio on a nice summer evening and read or watch the sunset

I have purchased Lentek Bite Shield because it is the only product  I was able to find, that works on the same principle as european mosquito repellents I am used to. I needed it for my daughter's bedroom so I couldn't use any type of candles for the safety reasons and I didn't want to use anything that rubbs directly on the skin since she has extremely sensitive skin. Lentek Bite Shild seems to work pretty well, she got bitten only once - the night I forgot to turn it on. Now I plan to buy the adapter to plug it in the outlet. That way I would be sure that the batteries wouldn't die in the middle of the night.

I am amazed. My mom sent this to me after I'd complained about already being eaten alive by mosquitos this year. I don't just get bites; I get huge, oddly shaped, so-itchy-they're-almost-painful, welts. And I am that person who attracts every single biting insect. I have often wished that I sweated DEET. However, I don't.

I tried this dubiously, first in the morning--I'd been getting bites every day between 8 and 10am (even with high % deet). --No bites.-- I still didn't believe it. I used it again that evening--after a rainstorm had come through--from about 6pm to 10pm. No bites! It comes with a belt clip, but I left it outside at one point when I came inside. The second I left its side, a mosquito landed on me.

I have, since then, used it several more times, no insect spray at all, and it's been very muggy around here. Absolutely no bites. I have seen a couple more bees than usual, and it turns out that the ingredient this blows out (geraniol) is said to attract bees. Not a big deal to me.

It apparently doesn't work for everyone. I have always assumed that there is some sort of chemical I give off that makes mosquitos head straight for me, bypassing everyone else. (I might be at a party where no one else even sees a mosquito and I leave with over a dozen bites.) I wonder if the geraniol somehow combines with whatever it is that I put out and neutralizes it. This could explain why it would work for some people and not other people.

At this price, it's worth it to find out if you are one of the people for whom it might work! I figure if I replace the cartridge every 2 weeks (~$3.50/cartridge), I will even be saving money because I'd been going through 1-2 cans of high-deet bug spray per week

We received one of these with our new Skeeter Beater.
I didn't know why there were no gnats, or mosquitos, buzzing around my head, and in my face, as there always are... yet,  no bugs were in the tray of this large Skeeter machine. I thought that it was repelling, instead of killing the gnats and mosquitos.  
Well, after a couple of days, my husband remembered that we received this little gizmo, and he had forgotten that he turned it on and left it running in the screen house.
This little thing was apparantly repelling the bugs away from the large skeeter unit!  It was sitting approximately 15' away.
Those gnats flying in your face and eyes, constantly, can drive you mad, and they were there all day, every day...what a nightmare!  Now, even in the evening, no mosquitos!  What the heck is in this thing?  It works without dangerous chemicals????
This is absolutely the best repeller I have ever used, and I have tried them all.  We live in a large wooded area, surrounded by ponds, lakes, and swamps.  We are amazed at this item, and will be buying more.  Psyche!!!  NO BUGS!!!

Ok, I just got one of these things, and I have to admit that last evening I stood by our seasonal stream watching the mosquitoes laying eggs on the water, and the mosquitoes weren't noticing me a bit.  I do have a big Lentek mosquito trap which has been helping quite a bit with the populations, but really, they should have been driving me nuts.

Now, I haven't yet used up a cartridge, so I don't know which one is inaccurate, but the online advertising, copied here and a zillion other places, says each cartridge lasts "at least 120 hours".  However, the product package says they last "up to 12 hours".  Big difference!  I've emailed the company and will be quite interested to learn which is the actual specification

My 7 yr. old son is allergic to mosquito bites, plus I'm concerned about West Nile virus.  Unfortunately, mosquitoes love him, and he always get some really nasty bites when he is sleeping.  I bought this little unit, and now have peace of mind!  I turn this on in his room for about half an hour at bedtime, leaving his door open, then turn it off and close his door.  Any mosquitoes lurking in his room have been driven out by the geranium scent.  I do the same in my own bedroom, and I am very pleased with the results.

The geranium scent is rather strong, but not unpleasant.  I don't find it necessary to leave this on all night, so it's not a problem.  I also like that you can clip this on your belt and turn it on for when you are outside.  It's just a tiny little fan blowing through the geranium scented cartridge, so it is small and light-weight

When the time zone change happened earlier this year, the clock worked like a champ and adjusted accordingly with the atomic clock.  The outdoor thermometer seems to give good temperature readings.  However, I would never, ever rely on the barometer to tell me if it's cloudy or sunny.  It's often wrong.  I also like the light projected readings of the clock.  It's too bad that you can't set the clock itself to be readable in the dark which I prefer sometimes over the projection

We absolutely LOVE it.  It is truly amazing.  We only wish we had this clock a long time ago.  We have missed out on a lot of fun and convenience.  We have enjoyed this instrument so much, that we ordered six more for each one of our children.  They have all reported back on how much they love theirs, as well

I recently purchased this clock for our bedroom and it has been one of my favorites purchases. I can read the clock during the day and night with no problem and the atomic clock set up within 2 minutes, it was so easy. I also like having the temputure show up. I would recommend this to everyone looking for a projection clock.

I read all of these reviews and searched the internet to find the best possible projection clock. This is it ! Are you nearsighted ? This clock is perfect for those of you like myself that do not see well without their contacts. I just couldn't believe how easy it was to read the temp and  time the first night on the ceiling. And my wife who HATES to have ANY light on - is NOT bothered by this at all...and LOVES being able to wake up in the middle of the night and check the time on the ceiling. Don't forget that the outside temp is on the ceiling as well - so you instantly know how warm or cold it is. You can mount this handheld remote temp sensor anywhere outside - and it sends the temp via radio signal back to the unit in your bedroom. It is amazingly easy to set up - and the weather forecaster works like a charm. I just can't say enough good things. This is a well made clock that serves many purposes and is super easy to use. I am planning on getting my mom one as well ( who is 70 plus ). Once you try this - you will NEVER want another clock. It's that good !

I bought this item as a gift for my dad.  I was unable to get the atomic clock to self set, but we live just outside of a large city, and I've heard this can cause some issues . . . In any event, my dad loves the crescendo alarm feature (as he gets up at 4:30 am) and the projection feature.  Everything else works fine, and I would recommend this item.  Perhaps if I played with the atomic clock a bit more I could get it to self set . . .

This is a great watch for people who are trying their hand at outdoor sports.  It is easy to use and not too bulky.  Wish is was made of a more durable material other than plastic, but like I mentioned it is great for a beginner to practice.  It has all of the main functions of watches costing much more so it does the job.  It is a very clean and smart looking watch

Great value - sure, case could be metal instead of polymer, but for the price the capabilities of the watch can't be beat...very intuitive interface and easy to use...compares favorably to watches costing 3-4 times as much..

The altimeter is not that accurate but that's the case with almost all the barometric altimeters, if u don't mind putting in the correct altitude once in an wile is OK
the rest is A O K

I use this watch for business trip all over the world, the function is very nice, the compass,temperature,weather forecast functions are very useful, especially, the baro-chart is very important to assist to judge the correct weather forecast. The color is very nice, but someone mentioned it would discolor, I think it should be, but not happen yet, because it always staid in a very good condition (only business trip), but if I go mountain-climbing, I suppose it might happen soon. Then why I did not give the 5 stars, the only disadvantage is the dual time mode, to show local and home town time in a same display is very very important during business trip, it can tell when I should call back to my company, and the display still has enough space to display the home town time, I think La Crosse should consider to improve this function. Anyway, this is still a useful watch for business trip

Saw this on a HGTV "Hot Grills" show, and knew instantly we needed it. Arrives nicely packaged, perfect for gift giving. Materials are nice - belt seems sturdy, is very adjustable (once you read the instructions - part of the belt is hidden under a velcro flap), and the tools are high quality. Lots of extra pockets for adding in your own stuff - a can of beer won't fit the pockets, but a bottle will.

A lot of the past grilling sets we've bought are cute but flimsy, not dishwasher safe, or made of too much plastic so they melt on the grill. These are metal with rubber in just the right places, and went through their first dishwasher cycle just fine.

Seemed a little expensive when I saw it online, but now that it's home, it seems like a good value. It'll pay for itself if we stop using (and leaving) our expensive indoor-only knives and tongs outside!

I bought this to monitor the evening outdoor temperature. When it finally cools off enough outside, I turn the air conditioner off and run just the fan on fresh air. This was simple to set up and seems to work flawlessly. I like that a change in temperature registers very quickly in tenths of a degree

This does what you want it to. Accurately tells the temp indoor and outside and refreshes itself about every 30 seconds. What more could you ask for? Theres also a blue backlight so you can press any button during the nightime. It also functions as a clock with an Alarm but I dont use it.

So far the device has entirely lived up to expectations.  Atomic Clock feature works fine and the range and accuracy on the remote sensor seems fair enough -- there is often about a 1-2 degree difference between the sensor and main unit if set right next to each other, but this is minor for the uses we get out of it (a quick look at outside temps during the winter).

The only issue we ran into that was "problematic" was the Ice Alarm feature.  This feature sets off the devices alarm anytime the temperature drops between 32 and 27 degrees or so to alert you to possible icy conditions.  The problem is that in cold climates the temperature hovers in that range all winter long...so the alarm goes off continually every 40 seconds or so.

We just happened upon a solution that has worked perfectly.  The ice alarm only works on Channel 1.  So, if you set the outside sensor to Channel 2 or 3 the ice alarm is disabled and is no longer triggered.  Obviously, they should have an ability to shut it off, but this is it...and even this isn't listed in the instructions

I never know what to get my mother-in-law for her birthday.  My husband mentioned that she had a lot of hummmingbirds around her house, so I got her this feeder.  She told me that all the hummingbirds now go to this feeder and not the others.  She was very pleased with it, which made me very happy.  She's a great mother-in-law

I bought this feeder about a week ago after spotting a hummingbird in my backyard.  It looks great in the yard and I love the detail in the hanger.  (It's nothing fancy, but it is sweet.)  I used the clear hummingbird formula and hung it in an area that didn't get a lot of people traffic, but was in clear view.  

Then I waited...

For three days there was nothing...then finally last night while sitting outside, my husband and I saw 3 different hummingbirds sipping from the feeder!!  I was so excited I immediately informed him (to his own distress) that our yard would be filled with feeders before long.  :)

I think it is a great buy and the hummingbirds really seem to like it.  I may consider one with a perch, but I must say that it is truly exciting watching them hover, then dart away.

Enjoy

I just put mine together and it warns that you mustn't keep the gas connected and that each time you reattach the gas you have to do a soap test.  I guess I can keep screwing the propane tank on and off, but that's such a pain and the soapy water is messy!

First roast turned out well, but in Winter, California, 60 degree weather it took a little longer than expected (2.5 lbs beef and it was edible/medium 160 degrees internal in about 3.5 hours and two rather large handfuls of apple chips soaked for 24 hrs).  The flame blew out three times and scared me because I wasn't watching it the whole time, and when I thought of propane exploding upwards!  I didn't think it would go out so easily, so I just ended up feeding it more gas and tried to cut the intensity of the heat using the air intake adjustment.  

You have to add more chips to get a lot of smoke flavor so that is easy, but you have to lift the whole body up and off including the water pot and meat, which could get heavy, but at least you can keep the lid on and keep some of the heat in there.  A good thing about this design is that if you are doing charcoal, you can replace the charcoal quickly.

Overall, I'm very excited, but I had those couple gripes...no door to access the water pan and no way to access the coals without lifting the whole top off and no easy way to remove the propane for safety.  I love the ease of having a gas option as you have to have the patience of a saint to tend to my other charcoal smoker as it didn't have a way to get rid of the ash to keep the temperature even and accessing the coal bowl was really a pain, especially if you wanted to add HOT glowing charcoal.  

I'm pleased though!  I got this one for my birthday as a gift to myself since I always wanted a gas grill for instant gratification.  I do love charcoal briquettes and chunks as well, so I'm pleased I still have that option.  Read the owners manual thouroughly before purchasing so that you don't have any surprises.  You also need adjustable wrenches or specific sizes (I used two crescent adjustable wrenches) to put it together, but it went together fairly intuitively and quickly

Bought this to use with my Weber Smokey Mountain.  I almost bought a Sunbeam rib rack for half the price at the local home improvement chain but it seemed a lot flimsier.  This rack is solid and built with Weber quality.

The one reason I can't give it 5 stars is because the Sunbeam rack has skewers for potatoes and I would really like to see that on this rack.  

If the ribs are too big, I just wrap them around the wrap quite easily

I bought this clock for my pool deck and it works great - it set itself within 10 minutes of putting the battery in.  I have it on a wall that has an overhang that is about 4 feet, so it is protected from the weather.  You can see it well from across the yard.  Have had several comments from visitors - they think its a great outdoor clock.  The thermometer is not automatically set, you need to set it.  It seems to work fine, I have checked it a couple of times with the local temperature on the radio/tv.  Would recommend the clock to those looking for an outdoor time piece

While we've used Coleman folding stoves for years, if you have trunk space, there is no reason on earth to limit yourself to a small stove when you can grill with this wonderful tabletop grill. The small tank makes this practical for camping. If you want real barbecue while tenting under the stars, and you camp where a tailgate or a picnic table is available, this is a great choice for camping equipment. We still like the Coleman for boiling water, but I love barbecuing on a propane grill like this

This is a nice rotisserie.  It could use another basket to keep the meat from getting away from it as it cooks (and shrinks in the process).  You will need pliers to tighten and loosen the baskets

I bought this clock last week. 
Amazon was prompt in shipping it on time.
On having received it I place the AA battery in the clock selected the time zone place it on the wall after some time the clock second hand and hour hand started moving fast. It is actually searching for the signal. If it gets it immediately the time will be set accurately in 5 minutes. 
If not every hour the clock searches for the accurate time relayed from the colorado server. The clock finds the time signal within the next 4-5 hours. The chances of the clock finding the signal is high over night when there is less distortion. 

Once ir receives the accurate time it will never fall behind. 

A very good time piece

I had to return my 1st order due to mould on the wood (around the joins) and inside the glass front. My replacement has a little mould inside the glass front, but I decided I could live with it.. I blame Amazon's storage for this rather than the manufacturing of it by LaCrosse.

The glass front is spherical, so tends to get weird light reflections, so watch for this when you are hanging it.

Note that when the battery is low, the second hand will move in 2 second jumps to let you know that the battery is low - this is a feature, not a problem, which I like.

Other than that it works great! (I live close to Boulder and NIST, where the radio signal comes from, so also take this into account when ordering any radio controlled clocks).

I just put mine together and it warns that you mustn't keep the gas connected and that each time you reattach the gas you have to do a soap test.  I guess I can keep screwing the propane tank on and off, but that's such a pain and the soapy water is messy!

First roast turned out well, but in Winter, California, 60 degree weather it took a little longer than expected (2.5 lbs beef and it was edible/medium 160 degrees internal in about 3.5 hours and two rather large handfuls of apple chips soaked for 24 hrs).  The flame blew out three times and scared me because I wasn't watching it the whole time, and when I thought of propane exploding upwards!  I didn't think it would go out so easily, so I just ended up feeding it more gas and tried to cut the intensity of the heat using the air intake adjustment.  

You have to add more chips to get a lot of smoke flavor so that is easy, but you have to lift the whole body up and off including the water pot and meat, which could get heavy, but at least you can keep the lid on and keep some of the heat in there.  A good thing about this design is that if you are doing charcoal, you can replace the charcoal quickly.

Overall, I'm very excited, but I had those couple gripes...no door to access the water pan and no way to access the coals without lifting the whole top off and no easy way to remove the propane for safety.  I love the ease of having a gas option as you have to have the patience of a saint to tend to my other charcoal smoker as it didn't have a way to get rid of the ash to keep the temperature even and accessing the coal bowl was really a pain, especially if you wanted to add HOT glowing charcoal.  

I'm pleased though!  I got this one for my birthday as a gift to myself since I always wanted a gas grill for instant gratification.  I do love charcoal briquettes and chunks as well, so I'm pleased I still have that option.  Read the owners manual thouroughly before purchasing so that you don't have any surprises.  You also need adjustable wrenches or specific sizes (I used two crescent adjustable wrenches) to put it together, but it went together fairly intuitively and quickly

This clock set itself within a few minutes and has worked well for the few months that we've had it. I loved not having to climb up and get it down to re-set it for daylight savings time!

Just so you know, this clock is not silver in color (I thought it was from the picture). It's more of a pearlized off-white

While the principle of the product is rather simple (a flat piece of metal with spikes sticking up), it is very useful. The instructions are very easy -   coat with a light coating of oil, and drop the potatoes on the metal spikes.  Stick on BBQ and cook. Allegedly cooks faster than potatoes would in an oven.

Here are my reflections after my first time using this contraption:

1) I started cooking potatoes at the same time as the steak and vegetables. By the time my steak and asparagus were cooked, the potatoes needed another 10 minutes or so. In hindsight, I should have started the potatoes while the grill was heating up; and they would have been done on time

2) I varied from the original instructions - wrapping two of the four potatoes in aluminum foil before placing them on the spikes. They cooked faster, though had less of a roasted taste (that I found very desirable!)

3) On one of the four spikes I placed a sweet potato - which tasted fantastic after coming off the grill! It needed no foil, and cooked a little faster than the exposed (foil-free) potatoes.

In summary, you should probably start cooking the potatoes while the grill is heating up. You can wrap them in foil to make the job faster; though it will cut back on the nice roasted flavor that you otherwise get.

I gave it 4 stars because it isn't 100% non-stick, even with a coat of oil. When I pull potatoes off the rack, they tend to stick to the spike and tear that part of the potato open. Still taste great, though

Works great with my LaCrosse weather station.  Make sure you check for compatible models.  I have two external temperature sensors now (one for outside and one for my shed).  The only issue is that you must remove the batteries from all units, install them back in the external temp sensors and then into the main weather station for it to find both of them correctly.  This is in the directions of course.  Hope this helps

This is a nice grill brush. It has stainless bristles not brass so I don't think I would use it on porcelain coated grates but is great for Stainless, chrome plated or cast iron. With 2 spare brush heads this is a good value

I don?t usually write things like this but having a Mosquitoes Magnet I wanted more protection without the annoyance of refilling and carrying propane around and not to mention the cost. Every three weeks having to buy propane is bad enough! I took a chance on this Galaxie product and I am glad I did its capturing everything in the yard. It appears to works almost as well as the Magnet and theirs no refilling propane!  If this keeps up I will buy two more of these units and retire the Magnet.  I give this product five stars!

I agree the green really isn't green but it's great.
I love it because the black grill covers show all the dust and 
dirt and this doesn't.  The color is wonderful. Great heavy duty cover.

Good quality and durability for any price!  Our back yard is in the direct sun all-day.  This umbrella is perfect for our yard because of the 11' canopy, and durability.  It gets quite windy in the afternoon, and the umbrella has held up well to rain, wind, & sun.  The only problem I had was the width of the pole.  It is too large to fit in out standard pool side tables.  I had to buy a heavy stand that would fit the 2" pole.  Problem solved!  Now I have a GREAT umbrella and a very heavy stand that seems to be the perfect accessory to our back yard, at a reasonable price.  Oh, and they delivered it before I thought they would.

Purchased the sofa and two chairs for my backyard and I have to say, they look great.  Clean lines, good proportions, beautiful chocolatey color.  The seat cushion is a bit firm, but that is probably good to help it hold up.  I have to say the linen cover is a bit disappointing as the fabric is a bit more like sailcloth then I'd hoped... but that is easily recovered, and I can certainly deal with it in the meantime, especially given the great price.  The only other thing is that the seat is quite deep and I feel like could have used some sort of back cushion, but we bought some outdoor throw pillows and that did the trick.  Let's hope these pieces hold up, as if they do, I'd say they are a great design value

This cover fits cleanly over the shape of the Weber grill.  It protects the finish, grill, and related parts from the elements while still allowing you to move the product around with the wheels.  The cover has lasted for 3 winters on my deck, through ice, snow, sleet, hail, rain, and hot baking sun.   It's a great cover for a great grill

Stylewise, it is a bit of an awkward fit in our traditional-decor house, so my wife had me locate it in my basement office.

Even from my northwest-facing daylight basement on the west side slope of the West hills in Portland, OR, this has no problem syncing itself to the atomic time radio signal  (which originates in Colorado) at night.  I love having an always accurate clock!

The thermometers seem accurate, the remote sensor has held up well so far, and I have not had to replace any batteries yet after three months of use.

Got this for $29 and free shipping. First one had a bad display. Second one came from Amazon in 2 days and worked fine. Takes a while for it to sync up. Outdoor temp was screwy but then settled in to something reasonable. Don't know about the accuracy as some other people have suggested, but seems in the ballpark to be correct. Very good looking piece - for $30 it is money well spent

There are two ways to measure the quality of an insect zapper. First, how powerful is it light? That will determine from how far away insects will be attracted. Second, how powerful are its "shocks"? That will, of course, determine what happens to the hapless critters. The Flowtron BK-40D performs both of these admirably.

This should be set up AWAY from your seating area - at least 10 yards. It will attract and kill so many insects that if it is near you, you will get covered. Also, the zapping noises it makes as it kills can be intimidating to young kids.

The plug comes off a short (6 inches or so) wire from the top as it hangs down from your pole. Make sure whatever extension cord you use is rated for outdoor use.

There is a compartment just below this model, which will fit a sticky mosquito attractant - one comes free with this package. You can get refills easily at Target or WalMart. Cost about $4. You probably will not need them, however, because the UV light does a good job of attracting insects.

I recommend it fully

I bought this item for my husband, when it arrived in the mail the box looked small, but he opened it and we checked it out. The weekend came and he made beer chicken, and he has since bbq 6 chickens.  He wants me to cook a beer can chicken in the oven, I like the idea but I'm not sure how to cook one in the oven. The grease and all, sounds like a mess..but I'll see what happens.

I've always felt it's probably a little unsanitary to use an aluminum beer can with inked labeling on a hot grill.  Maybe not, but it gives me pause.  This device works as a more stable and possibly more healthy alternative to a can of Bud.  It is also perfect if you want to use other liquids such as wine, juice or whatever.  The only downside is the clean-up.  It consists of four parts, each of which get coated with chicken drippings and need some serious scrubbing to get off the cooked-on residue.  I've found a dishwasher alone doesn't really remove all of it.  A little scrubbing is necessary to really get the device clean.  

This is certainly a useful item for us backyard cooks.  It's a little inconvenient compared to using a beer can that can be tossed in the trash after using

We use it for a small tailgate (we have other grills for larger tailgate parties) party serving three people. It is not big enough to serve more people. After several uses we learned that we had to use more charcoal, and once we made the change and increased the amount of charcoal (almost to the top)the grill was able to cook a second round of food. Packs up very easily, sets up very easily, and puts together very easily. Can cook 2 steaks and a few franks OR 6 hamburgers at one time.

I got this grill for Mother's Day from my boyfriend.  He is really into buying things that last and things that are worth the money. This is one of those items! This grill is great! I just love it, I have grilled 3 times so far and everything has been perfect, it cooks really fast and even I would highly recommend this.  With the chimney we were able to reuse some of the charcoals twice so far which is just cool. So, get the Weber chimney as well! You will be just as pleased as I am with my new grill

I was skeptical after reading some of the reviews of this and looking at the price.  Once i got it and lit it, unbelievable.  I have a tendency to read the reviews and pick up on others issues with products, so there is a little propane hissing, but the heat that it puts out is unbelievable.  The flame levels were alot higher when you think about how much heat and flames your grill puts out.  The handles/footrests are heavy duty and perfectly placed.  Saying all that, i can see the only drawback is the amount of fuel you might go through.  It says that it last 7 hrs, that might be a little generous.  I got rave reviews when i started it up, and the next day when we had a real fire pit going, everyone appreciated that they didn't have to wash their clothes due to the smokey smell.  That has to be the best part.  Aagin, great product

This grill is great.  It heated up fast and cooked up my steaks pretty evenly.  Much much better than grills I've used in the past.

Assembly took about an hour by myself.  I'd recommend having another person to help you.  The assembly instructions are all pictures and no text, so it's a bit difficult to follow at times.  The construction of the grill is very good.  The stainless steel tracks tons of finger prints, but looks beautiful.

The penny shipping was good, too.  I received the grill exactly a week from the day I ordered it.  Eagle called me the day before to schedule a delivery time and on the day of delivery, they called in advance of showing up so I didn't have to wait around at home for them.  The delivery guy wheeled it all the way into my garage for me

The other reviews are correct. This unit works very well in every way, a basket mesh kind of food holder would be a good option, use a drip pan and keep the coals off to the sides, the ring riser/extension is useful for smoking and cooking big things, etc. It is all good, but there is more:

Who do you know who actually has a charcoal grill and a rotisserie? Nobody. If you get one, your guests will be entertained on several levels and you will be the Master. A rotisseries is professional looking, produces unmatched taste and an exciting demonstration-style cooking experience for everyone. Those that utilize them are seen as proficient and competent. Not a bad label for you, eh? Might get you somewhere.

The best meal I ever had was a rotisserie turkey that saved me from starvation after a Hike of Death. Perhaps it can save you or a loved one.

Rotisserie cooking lends itself to the acclaimed high heat, short cooking time technique. Hot coals and the self-basting action work well here. One of the major gourmet magazines cooked turkeys every way known and strongly recommended the high heat way. This is also the suggested method for cooking heritage meats and wild game.

Starting out at 500+ degrees and ending at something short of US government temperature recommendations is the secret. A turkey, for example, is best taken out of the heat at around 170, or less, and allowed to rest. It will go up around 10 degrees after that. 

I tie bacon strips onto the breast and add wet smoking wood chips to the coals. Stuff the cavity with an orange and some garlic. Other things could be used, too. I have rotisseried heritage, free range, organic, kosher and regular good quality supermart turkeys with this high-heat method and they have all been good. 

Governments and institutions have to recommend a heat guaranteed to kill off any and everything, and prevent lawsuits of course. However, fresh good quality meat does not have to be nuked to the point where you could make furniture out of it. Use a separate thermometer, not the supplied pop-out sensor. I am no professional, but I can say it produces the best tasting food.

This cover is very durable and after reading the great reviews on it, I had to get it. I purchased a cheap cover and of course it fell apart and the sun baked it another color. The Weber premium cover looks great and is holding up in the Arizona heat and sun! I am very pleased with it and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone with a Weber grill!!! :)

My story is this:  Got some mice in the house at the start of the winter.  Little poops all over, chewed cereal bars in the closet/cupboard, mice in the trash can etc.  Laid out traps and caught four of them but still had: little poops all over, chewed cereal bars in the closet/cupboard, mice in the trash can etc.  So I brought two of these units.  At first I put them both in the basement where I had actually seen the little critters (I have a pretty big house) and I didn't see any evidence of them in the basement after two days or so but upstairs it was still: little poops all over, chewed cereal bars in the closet/cupboard, mice in the trash can etc.  So I moved the "pest repellers" upstairs and put all my food items in plastic containers.  I saw some evidence of a mouse in the trash the first morning but since then, nothing. I don't know if it was me storing the food better, the pest repellers or both but I have seen nothing.  I have been moving these things around the house every other day or so and they seem to work for me.  I would give the unit five stars but they do have one draw back, they do make noise.  If you expect these things to be quiet your in trouble, they chirp.  It's not too loud and doesn't bother our dog or us but it does make noise.  For me the chirping is a small price to pay to get rid of the mice.

I love my hammock. I actually have 2 now, and they are both in my backyard. I like the white because it goes well with my yard, and sometimes with the multi colored ones you never know what you're going to get. It is also extremely comfortable. If you combine this with the smell of cut grass and a cool breeze and I think you may have just found the key to life

I have been wanting a smoker for a long time and have looked at several.I liked the looks of this unit and could not be happier with the results. I smoked baby back ribs and they were fabulous. I have used it three times and the results were the same fantastic. I talked my grandson into buying one, thats what I think of the smoker.
It assembles easily and is quite attractive on my patio. I just purchased a cover to keep it protected from the sweltering Texas climate.                           R.F.O'Har

Tired of BBQ tongs that cant hold a steak? Cant pickup a slice of eggplant?  Drop hot dogs?  Do away with that stress.  These tongs are able to handle the weight of a large steak as well as manueverable enough to flip thin slices of veggies. The coated handle NEVER gets hot and the overall shape is long enough to reach deep into a grill without scorching your hands.  An instant favorite at our house

Another gadget I had to have.  The best thing about this is the ease of finding the outdoor temperature at night.  It clearly is shown on your ceiling but not distracting when trying to sleep.  You can be just laying there and all you have to do is open your eyes and there is the temperature and if you want you can have it also show the time of day.  The temp and time appear alternately every few seconds.

During daylight hours you cannot see this on the ceiling but you can look at the devise and it will have the same information.  The time is kept in sinc with the atomic time via over the air electronic signals. 

For the price, I reccomend this little toy.

I have found that the outdoor receiving device does need to be located in an area that does not get direct sunlight.  The estimated temperature can be way off when the sun is in a position to affect the receiver, so proper positioning is important

I've been very pleased with this set of BBQ tools.  They are comfortable to use and long enough to keep me away from the flame/heat but not so long they feel unwieldy.  They have a solid feel with comfortable grips (especially for someone with smaller hands - eg, most women), they are easy to wash, and stand up to lots of use (we grill year-round).  I would buy this set again.  It is a big improvement over my last set

I thought I had it made when I got the hammock...the pillow makes it ten times better! The pillow makes it easier to roll over and more comfortable - you can't feel the individual strings in the hammock so much but you  still get the &quot;hammock&quot; feeling. I recommend taking it inside  after every use to make it last longer, but it IS weather proof. A must  have if you have a hammock

I'm sorry but this thing has worked in my room. My breaking point was when I found a massive roach in my bed, well, half of it on my bed and the rest on my upper back... 

I had nasty spiders and mice over-running the place but ever since I installed it, I haven't seen any. I do, however, see them in other rooms, but not one in mine

This lounge/deck chair cushon is worth every peny. It is thick, comfortable (none of those deck chairs are comfortable without a substantial cushion), available in several color choices, and has a soft, not plasticky, cover fabric. You will have to measure the width of your deck chair carefully to see if it will fit. It just barely fit my 'titanic' deck chair because I had to scrunch it up a bit near the arms. But all turned out well and I must say I am very happy with it. It is a quality product and will keep you much more comfortable during your hours on the patio than those cheaper, but much thinner, types sold at outlet stores or supermarkets in summer. Get the best. This is it

I searched a long time for a cushion to fit an old lounge chair which had slightly larger measurements for the new cushions at most stores today.  Horray!!!!!!!!!!  This one is perfect and has served me well for comfort and weather resistance.  It has been an unusually rainy month of May and the cushion justs dries with little or no wiping.  So comfortable too

I haven't had any problems with this clock. It does what it's supposed to, and looks pretty good doing it. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I haven't had it that long ... maybe 3 or 4 weeks. So I'm not sure how it's overall durability will be, but so far so good. Dailight Savings Time is coming up, that will be one of it's first "real" tests. If you're thinking about buying it I say go for it

I thought this was a really good price.  I have yet to season mine, but plan to use it to grill steak indoors when the weather is not so great outside (i.e., 105 degree heat, or chilly winter nights).  I'm still researching seasoning and asking friends for tips on that.

I'm also considering the Emeril cast iron smoker. :)  That costs a bit more though.

A previous reviewer complained about the metallic taste when using this item.  It should be noted that nowhere on the package is the user told that seasoning must be done before it should be used.  I have lots of cast iron utensils and pans so I was well aware of that fact.  I don't use oil as it can give off an unpleasant odor if not completely absorbed into the metal.  I use melted shortening instead.
As far as the grill press itself goes, I couldn't be happier with it.  I used it with Steven Raichlen's Tuscan Grill and it produced very distinctive and flavorful grill marks on steak.  It is great for grilling  butterflied chicken too.  In fact, it is so good with chicken that I might have to have a second one!  If you feel that grilled food should not only taste great but look appetizing too, give this a try.  You'll look like a barbecue guru!

Please remember that unseasoned cast iron needs to be seasoned by the consumer before the first use.  It will rust if not properly seasoned.  To season the Grill Press, remove the handle by unscrewing the two screws on either end.  Rinse with mild soap and water, then thoroughly dry.  Rub cooking oil over the entire surface with a clean rag or a paper towel.  Place it in an oven preheated to 250 degrees fahrenheit for approximately 2 hours.  Handle with care when removing, as the Press will be quite hot.  Use a hot pad.  Let the Grill Press cool on a heat resistant surface, replace the handle, and then store as usual.  Because cast iron is porous, each time you use the Grill Press following the initial seasoning more oil will seep through from foods and enforce the waterproof oil bond.  The Grill Press should not be left in water and is not dishwasher safe.  Rinse the press under hot water after each use and dry immediately by blotting water droplets with a towel.  If directions are properly followed, your Steven Raichlen Cast Iron Grill Press should last for years.

I just received these chairs today.  
They came double boxed and arrived safely.
These are lounge or deep seating chairs, since the description does not specify and they are very comfy.
The frames are in a bronze/brown color, the seating pads are in a tan and off-white and look to be good quality.  My little daughter climbed on the chairs with her muddy shoes as soon as I had them out of the box and I could just dust the dirt off the cushions after letting it dry.
The chairs look to have a solid construction and are not quite as light as some of the cheaper ones you find in the stores.
The chairs are stackable too.
Would buy them again

Not as versatile as the one we bought over 20 years ago at the San Antonio Folk Life Festival, but every bit as well made. The original was adjustable so you could stretch out better, but this one is equally comfortable. And this one actually has a better support bar

I received this chair as a Christmas gift last year.  It has been out in the weather most of the time since then and still looks and performs as good as new. It is very easy to unhook and bring in during wind or rain storms. This chair is so comfortable that it has become my daily relaxation ritual. When I first opened its box, I was suprised at the thin cotton twine and I had a hard time imagining it could support me and whichever pet would be on my lap. However it even holds my 240 lb. son with no problem. I suggest that you anchor it to a beam; and if you get one that has problems, exchange it for another one

I can't complain about the durability of these sensors.  I bought the original La Crosse weather station about 5 years ago while located in Texas.  It has recorded temperatures as high as 113 degrees and since I moved to NJ 2.5 years ago, it has also recorded as low as 18 below.  I'd say that's a pretty durable unit so had no qualms about buying a replacement when the original one quit recording humidity and bounced around on the temperature readings within short timeframes.  I'm back and working now that I have this unit...I can't live without my weather station and the La Crosse is nice looking and works

I just recieved this in the mail. Setup was 15 minutes, but the frame and metal is thin.  I am not saying it isn't a good unit, but I am afraid it won't last as long as I had intended.  The burn areas is bigger than most I have seen, but the pan below appears to have some gaps allowing ambers to fall to the grownd.  Again, I have not used this yet - but was expecting it to be a bit tougher in the frame.  I would not pay more than $150 for this - HD, LOWES & Other locations provide for a bit more money what I believe could be longer lasting units.  Overall I am glad I purchased this but learned quality cannont be confirmed via a picture or desciption.  Best of luck and happy burning

The chair set LOOKS great and was pretty much put together. Instructions are OK but could use some more close ups. So here is the trick I found that wasn't mentioned. It is best (the only way I could get things connected at all) to put the "cap" (like a fancy nut with a flange) in the slot first and then feed the bolt into it. That bit of information would have helped a lot. I "do" put lots of things similar to this together so not a complete novice. 

The other - a bit more major problem - was that one leg of the chair appears to have denser wood or the pilot holes were not drilled correctly. So no matter what I did on one side I could not get the final SCREWS (there are only four as other connectors are bolts with end caps) in all the way and came close to permanently stipping the hex bolts. The answer is to drill longer pilot holes but I need someone with a drill to do that so it will be down the line.

I also agree that it is not very comfortable without a thick cushion like the type that goes on lots of outdoor furniture.

So a good product and better than some "put it together yourself" but not perfect. It seems very sturdy but as another reviewer stated it is too soon to tell the longevity of the product

Well, I was looking for a nice Adirondack for a while...getting frustrated with the $249.99 price at most stores.  I decided to take a chance on this chair and I could not be any happier.  This is a quality chair, well built and beautiful right out of the box.  Assembly is easy (compared to any boxed item), but does take some patience (took me an hour for the 1t chair but I'm a moron when it comes to putting things together).  I highly recommend these chairs

I put this on my Amazon Wish List and got it for christmas.  It was easy to set up and does exactly what it is supposed to do w/no glitches or resets.  weather in indiana can be pretty festive so I'm sure this unit will get a big workout.  Only disappointment -- it takes five batteries which are not included; I didn't have that many so I had to wait (oh, bother) to go to the store to set it up.  I would like one that measures wind velocity too, but I haven't found one that does that.  All in all, a very helpful, easy to read and understand unit

I recently purchased this model to replace a separate radio controlled atomic clock and wired In/Out thermometer.

The unit seems well made and the display is easy to read. Based upon my experience so far I would still buy one but the design/implementation could certainly be improved.

1 - The remote distance of 80' is line of sight under perfect conditions. The manual suggests to deduct 20-30 feet for an external wall. If there wasn't an external wall it wouldn't be outdoors now would it?

2 - The time of day is only updated once a day at/near midnight. My unit is off by 2 seconds by noon. Not a big deal but one would expect a bit more accuracy.

3 - The algorithyms for computing the sunrise/sunset and moonrise/moonset seem to be off a couple of minutes when compared to values from Intellicast, etc.

4 - The temperatures and humidities seem accurate compared to other measurements I have.

5 - Even though it has a 'rain cap' the external sensor must be out of direct rain fall such as under the eaves.

6 - The oak trim is just a vinyl decal on plastic. Nobody is going to confuse it will real wood.

However, in spite of my criticisms I think it is a good unit for approximate weather monitoring

Proof positive that you don't have to hanging under a palm tree on a white sandy beach to fully appreciate the hammock experience! These hammocks are perhaps the most blissful place one can rest, and it really doesn't matter  whether they are hung between support walls in your living room or strung  between two trees in the backyard. I have spent countless hours perfecting  my hammock posture and in the course of this perfection have test-driven a  whole bunch of hammocks. I can, with absolute certainty, tell you that this  hammock is the stuff dreams are made of. It is constructed of a durable and  soft cotton that breathes with you and doesn't cause itchiness or that  unpleasant &quot;Plastic&quot; feeling. When it is strung up right, you can  either lay horizontally or vertically - it matters not because it's  amazingly comfortable either way. Some of my most peaceful sleep and  dreamiest dreams have come from hammock-induced slumber. I strongly  recommend it for any and everyone considering their sleeping alternatives.  The hammock isn't banished to the tropics anymore, and in fact looks just  great in my Kansas living room. Trust me - get a little tired and get a big  ole hammock! This one in partiucular will make your socks roll up and down

I bought this for my Weber Q because the cover designed for the Q just didn't cut it.  It was too small and I didn't like the fact that it didn't cover the stand or the utensils I have hanging from the grill.  While this cover is a bit big, it covers the grill, stand and tank just fine.   I think the heavy duty weight will do just fine in the windy and frigid Chicago winter.

Just like everyone else says, this really is a great product.  True, you can use a cheap stand with a real "beer-can" but with since it collects all the juices it makes it well worth it.  Cleanup is easy, chicken comes out very, very juicy and it cooks faster since you are also cooking from within.  When I first used it my wife and I were amazed how better the chicken tasted.  This is the best way to cook a whole chicken on the grill!  I use it on my gas grill and charcoal grill.  However, make sure you don't buy too big a bird or you may have trouble closing the lid.  That's not of fault of this product since it would be the same with any vertical roaster.  Buy this for you or as a gift!  It's great!

We purchased this roaster for my father.  He made an excellent chicken with it last weekend.  It provides a nice sturdy base to set your chicken on and allows you to add veggies, beer, wine, etc very easily.  I was very impressed on how it held and chicken and the ease of removing the chicken once done cooking.  We have a very cheep "beer-in-the-butt" holder and the Weber Roaster was much more stable and easy to use.  I do not give it 5 stars because it set the chicken so high, the lid to my fathers Weber Charcoal Grill would not fit.  However, he was able to rig a smaller grill rack to sit lower in the grill and it cooked fine.
We had great chicken

I love grilling vegetables and I have quite a few grilling baskets for different purposes. I got this for veggie. The size of the basket is good, enough for 4 adults. The lid is flipping on the narrow side and I found it could be awkward when you open it and try to serve the food into the plates. It just hang and I have to lift the basket really high or ask my husband to help to hold the lid. It's relatively easy to clean. There are some hard spots when the grid overlaps. Again, I wish the lid was removable rather than fixed on the narrow end

Ho, noble comrades! `Twas time again for the Fellowship Fan Club to host its Annual Sauron Scavenger Hunt. As ever, the goal was simple: Club Chairman Solun Fangtooth (my neighbor, Glen) took thine replica One Ring, authentic down to the Mordor Elvish inscribed around the band, and hid it in yon forested creek behind his parents' abode. The five new members of the cabal, myself included, would comb the wilderness in search of this mighty treasure. He who was first to unearth Sauron's golden band of evil would be promoted from rank of Hobbit to the Council of Elrond, and get to choose the location for our next screening of all three LOTR films.

The rules of the hunt are simple: any method is allowed, provided it can be justified as the tactics and materials of a fantasy character.

 The other four fledglings, cloaked in robes of Rivendell and carrying Torches of Truth (in the form of flashlights), scoured the wooded gully, seeking some minor clue of Fangtooth's passing. But having shared a road-trip to ComiCon with Fangtooth, I knew him to be a wily foe - it would take wits, not persistence, to uncover the location of the One Ring.

To this end, I unsheathed mine ultimate weapon: the Bounty Hunter Quick Draw II Metal Detector. A gift from my patriarch for the passage of boyhood to man, I had honed my skills at alloy retrieval on the sands of Hilton's Head. Finding 64 in Coins of the Realm, I knew the path to advancement lay in the probing waves of this device.

Setting the proper adjustments to compensate for uninteresting metallic flotsam (nails, etc.), I knew the rhythmic beeps of the Quick Draw II would lead me to victory. In practiced, methodical sweeps of the search coil, I combed the creekbed, finding the One Ring in a shallow pool, partially buried in the silt. Victory was mine. My own.

Of course, there were protestations at my ingenuity. Some argued that the technological marvel of the Quick Draw II was outside the boundaries of our club charter. However, I deftly explained that the very name of this product led me to adopt the perfect fantasy persona: I was a bounty hunter - one who used any means necessary to achieve his goals. I was Bilbo Fett!

This set of cleaning tools is some of the best money I've ever spent.  In fact, I just returned to order a third set.  The first for me, a second set for my mother-in-law, and another set for me as a spare since I don't want to be without this product.  I've never had such an easy time cleaning my ceiling fans and my vaulted ceiling.  Great value for the money, and I've only used 2 of the attachments

The Weber grill has always been the Cadilac of BBQ grilling.  It is a quality good - it won't rust and will last a decade even when left outdoors.  Its other claim to fame is the ability it offers to "shut off the charcoal" as it is air tight.  The "one touch" system just makes it even easier.  Instead of having to close three bottom vents seperately (and fumbling with hot surfaces that cannot be easily seen), you just flip one lever.  You make up your mind yourself about the silver vs. gold models as both are good.  What size do you need?  What do you want to cook?  A turkey? - better get the 22 1/2 inch size.  If you have a chicken or a roast in mind, the 18 1/2 inch will do and it will save you some fuel to boot

After looking for a good grill and surfing the web for a while, I read the reviews about this one and I thought lets try it.
Installation of this grill was really easy, you don't need any specific tool.
Let me say that I didn't have any experience with grilling but this grill is incredible, it holds the heat perfectly and you wouldn't end up having black and burned or even raw meat. 
The meat is really juicy and delicious.
I think that I got a great deal, I even didn't pay for shipping!

This is just what you have been looking for.  A dependable, accurate device to be aware of the tempatures that concern you. Available are extra remotes so you can monitor as many as 3 stations. Even one with a probe so ou can monitor freezer tempature, or tempature in fish pond.  Reliable, easy to work on but you need to follow instructions.  Good price

This may be called a roast holder but you've missed out until you have used one to cook a turkey.  You can cook up to a 14 lb. turkey easily in a 22-1/2 inch grill using this rack.  I cooked my first turkey in a Weber 21 years ago and have cooked at least two every year since.  There is no comparison if you want a moist tasty turkey.  My family would mutiny if I tried to cook a turkey any other way and my wife loves to have her oven available to fix the rest of the holiday dinner.  Maybe one day I'll try cook a roast but I wouldn't trade this rack for any other way to cook a turkey

The Weber Smokey Joe Grill is a real performer. We are so pleased we purchased one of these. We cook a lot on the grill weather permitting. The Smokey Joe Grill fires up quick. The Smokey Joe Grill also cooks up burgers, hotdogs and steaks evenly and in short order to perfection. I really mean it. We love it. The food is ready in no time. The Smokey Joe Grill is really an efficient unit and is quite innocuous in appearance. It is quite mobile and seems to fit anywhere for use or storage. It is actually quite amazing. We have noticed that we use less charcoal, lighter fluid, save time, get better tasting food and save time on cleanup. We own two depending on how much we are going to cook. The smaller units are perfect for two people or a third or even a forth if somebody happens to stop by.

It's a very durable grill that should last years, if not decades.  At this size, it's strictly a grill -- you won't offset-cook on this. 

A note: Weber grills are made to be used with the lid on, always. If you cook without the lid on, you lose temperature control, the fire often gets too hot and you get the old burned-on-the-outside-raw-on-the-inside syndrome. With the lid on and the vents in use, Webers are the best charcoal grills at temperature control in my experience...although the smaller the grill, the harder it is.

I think Weber still makes the slightly larger version of the Smokey Joe -- one with an 18.5-inch grill. That will give you a lot more flexibility while still being very portable. It's possible to offset-cook chicken for two on an 18.5-inch grill but probably not on this one.

And finally, this is not for use on your apartment balcony. That's illegal in most places and most assuredly dangerous. Even if you have a concrete balcony, sparks can waft away from your grill and set something else on fire

This fork thermometer takes an accurate temp reading; and is a good deal for the price. It does have one quirk -it has a button to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit which I keep accidentally hitting when I hold the fork. So I end up reading the temperature wrong because it has inadvertently changed to Celcius.  Just be aware of this and the fork will work fine for all sorts of cooking

The item showed up nearly a week before I was expecting it. Due to its weight, the free shipping was an added plus. The delivery company actually placed the grill inside my garage which was very helpful again due to its weight and the size of the boxes. The directions provided to assemble the grill were vague and very difficult to interupt. The directions indicated to plan about 30 to 40 minutes to assemble. It took almost 2 hours and I am very mechanically inclined. Once assembled the grill worked perfectly. If I had to do it over again, I would buy this grill, but would love to have better directions

This is a great tool for the grill. It is the easiest one to use I have found. The readout is a grid which tells you how done any piece of meat is based on the temp - this allows you to check different things on the grill (i.e. chicken and beef) without having to reprogram the fork.  Plus the readout is backlit and it has a light to help when grillin at night.  The only negative is that it is not water resistant so you have to be careful washing it.  I got water in mine when washing it one time, and now it is somewhat temperamental - sometimes when checking the temp on the grill, it goes blank, and I have to pull out my old one to get a reading.  I still recommend this one - just be careful when cleaning it!

This is a good addition to a patio space when an umbrella stand is needed, as the design and color of the base blend in with most newer outdoor furniture.  The base is sturdy and solid and comes with five rubber feet that are screwed into the base for added stability and for leveling on uneven surfaces.  The diameter of the base's stalk holds most patio umbrellas, but be sure to measure the diameter of yours first before ordering this size (1 3/4" diameter) instead of the larger size available elsewhere.  Contrary to the original description of this item, however, the weight is NOT 70 pounds.  It's closer to 61 pounds without the stalk and 63 pounds with it.  (UPS recorded the weight at 67 pounds, not the 73 pounds claimed in the description.  The package dimensions are also smaller at 25" x 25" x 4".)  Also, the diameter is NOT 28" but is 22" - 23", so be aware of that as well.  Had the description here on Amazon been more accurate, I would have rated the item higher..

This is a very handy item.  It can be lowered or raised according to what you need.  I needed it to hold a tabletop Christmas tree at the holidays and it was terrific. Now I used it as a lamp/end table with a decorative tablecloth and topper. The item is very sturdy, much more so than the little round tables you can buy to act as lamp table. I bought a smaller one for my office to expand my counterspace.  It can be folded up when I don't need it.

This dandy should be available year-round; it does everything it's advertised to do, plus looks Great and is comfy to sit on, too! Easy to assemble (no tools needed). Would be neat if it were available in many other solid colors, but the cream color is nice and neutral. Its totally waterproof, as promised! It's unavailable now, but I would seriously consider buying another when it is again available! Cattle dogamine also likes to sit on it

Hi Folks, I want you to know,you just can't go wrong with this Pitmaster, I can Grill on it. I can Smoke on it. My wife surprised me with it in 96' since then,I have slow cooking ribs, and the usual hotdogs and hamburger.And I have even ROTISSERIE a 12 to 14 pound Turkey on it (my own design) to do this, the shin is crispy all the way around...You just can't have a REAL Bar-B-Q without a Deluxe Pitmaster..If you really like outdoor cookin' this is the way to go...

I bought the (apparently identical) Charbroil from Lowe's for my son, because it was rated so highly by Consumer's.  I had the opportunity to cook on it twice, and was very impressed -- very even; very controllable.

So, I bought one for myself from Amazon, and am still impressed.  I think the reviewer who commented on the bad packing may have received a received a return.  The packing on mine was good, with everything plastic bagged; no scratches, finish looked OK.

Assembly is not for the light-hearted, but the biggest problem was the assembly instruction sheet.  Not very clear, uses "beside" where it should say "inside"; makes no mention until 3/4 of the way through that there are different lengths of screw, and does not differentiate between regular and sheet metal screws.  However, I had no real problem, but assembly does take 1 1/2 - 2 hours.

I thought the construction was quite good.  Certainly nothing is much stronger or heavier than it needs to be, but this means that the grill is no heavier than it needs to be!  When assembled everything feels very solid.  I did take the wheels off and reinstall them after completing the frame so that I could tighten all screws when the frame was fully assembled and squared.  Probably not necessary, but it only added about 30 seconds.  Next time I would delay installing the wheels for a few steps.

I give five stars because I do not know of another grill in this price range that is as large, has so many features, and cooks so well

I have been looking at grilles for over a year now, i had to retire my trusty Quickset. for all the features, size and quality, this one cant be beat. Assembly was very extensive, but if you have ever put anything together that was more complicated then a pizza box, you can put this together. Packaging wasnt the best, but mine was in really good shape, so i cant complain much. it looks better, has a larger cooking area, heats more evenly, heats more quickly, and is easier to clean then my fathers $1400 grille, and mine has the griddle that his lacks.

if you are looking for a solid all around performer then this is the grille for you.    if you dont know how to use a screwdriver, and dont have the patience to assemble anything, then either pay someone to do it, or chose some thing alittle more basic, like a quickset model

Seems to be a quality product, but as others have already mentioned, the instruction booklet is seriously lacking.  For one thing, there is no Index, nor Table Of Contents.  I have spent about an hour trying to figure out how to engage the alarms for outdoor High Temp, etc., to no avail.  I guess I am just not hitting the right buttons, or leaving them depressed long enough.  I WAS able to calibrate the barometer to match my wall-mounted barometer and I have to admit - it works VERY well.  I enjoy too the barometric histogram, covering the last 36 hours.  

Because the booklet doesn't explain, I am still trying to figure out what the percentage factor of the "Forecast Index" really means, and why it sometimes is presented as "12 hour forecast", and other times it is 24 hour forecast.  

Because the outdoor sensor is not waterproof, it becomes a bit of a challenge in locating the device to where it will be protected from rain, and direct sun exposure, etc., and yet be out in the open for a true reading, so as to not be influenced by warmth radiating from the house.  La Crosse ought to strive for a waterproof sensor someday

I have 4 more atomic clocks (2 more analogue and 2 digital ones) as well as 3 atomic watches. Self setting function works exactly the same on all of them. So I think it's worth setting the expectations straight for how this clock will most likely work for you. Unless you live close to Colorado (where the time signal originates) the proper way of 'setting' this clock is to put the battery in and wait overnight for the clock to set itself. Best signal reception depends on where you live and also on time of year and weather conditions. In Charlotte, NC where I live - most of my atomic clocks and watches sync themselves around 2 am. I guess it's a bit confusing to people unfamiliar with the 'atomic' technology to see the hands of the clock start moving around and then stopping at some random hour as if though the clock was broken... La Crosse (and other makers) should probably include a 'quick start' card that states in big bold letters to put the battery in, select your time zone, IGNORE any hand movement (or lack there of) and then WAIT overnight. Again - unless you live close enough to CO so that the clock can receive time signal any time of day or night - you will have to wait until the next day.

I've had this clock for around 6 months now and it worked perfectly well (to within 1 second of actual time) with the exception of a couple bizarre quirks. One time the clock got itself off by 15 minutes (though the seconds hand was dead on). I did not adjust it - and the next day it fixed itself through its usual overnight self-setting. Another time it spontaneously changed time zones and started showing California time. This time around I had to remove the battery, reinsert it and re-select the time zone (simply re-selecting time zone did not solve the problem).

As another reviewer remarked - the clock looks nicer 'in person' than it does on the photos. The very thin rim makes the dial look a bit bigger than the stated dimensions would suggest. Face color is off-white or very light cream and looks very nice. As for the build quality - it's nothing special. The clock is 100% plastic (even the 'crystal') except for the dial which is simply paper. The whole thing - including mechanism - is made in China. Even though the clock is probably extremely cheap to manufacture (given its all plastic construction) it does not LOOK 'cheap' once it hangs on the wall. I bought a virtually identical quality atomic clock for seven bux (delivered) on everybody's favorite auction site and it looks OK - but not as nice as this one (a different 'brand' - not La Crosse).

One star taken off for the 'quirks' - but  not for the 'good enough' materials engineering (it would be better if it was made less cheaply - but it looks fine the way it is).

This lounge/deck chair cushon is worth every peny. It is thick, comfortable (none of those deck chairs are comfortable without a substantial cushion), available in several color choices, and has a soft, not plasticky, cover fabric. You will have to measure the width of your deck chair carefully to see if it will fit. It just barely fit my 'titanic' deck chair because I had to scrunch it up a bit near the arms. But all turned out well and I must say I am very happy with it. It is a quality product and will keep you much more comfortable during your hours on the patio than those cheaper, but much thinner, types sold at outlet stores or supermarkets in summer. Get the best. This is it

There are plenty of detailed reviews both PRO and CON so I will keep mine brief. I just want to chime in on the PRO side. For the $185.00 incl. shipping I paid at Amazon it is well worth the price. Now, if I were paying closer to four or five hundred I would go with the Davis. But, again, for the price I am plenty pleased. 

P.S. Be sure to download the Radio Shack manual. It is a must

So far great product.  I had no issues setting up.  Just follow the directions and give it time to lock onto the local time clock.  I have my remote about 100 ft from my house and it is working fine.  I like the display.  I would avoid the alarms you set, as they go off and keep beeping until you reset.  My alarm went off at 1:00 am and I was wondering if it was some alarm clock I forgot.  Took a while to figure what was beeping at that time in the morning

This weather station is great.  It tells me an amazing amout of information.  It is easy to use and set up.  The only thing I would change is that the High's and Low's would reset every day.  Right now you have to manualy reset them

Although this device works well and it's fun to see the things it measures, it took a while to get it to work to our satisfaction. An alarm went off each day and we didn't know why. A call to La Crosse Technology solved the problem. The technician was knowledable, courteous and helpful

I've had this unit for about a month. Before buying, I visited the manufacturer's site, downloaded the instruction manual and read it through. It's important to learn as much as you can about the product before buying, especially site unseen over the 'net.  A picture never tells it all. 

Very easy to set up. Just pop in the batteries (in the proper order, of course) and you're up and running in minutes. The only adjustments were the city location and LCD constrast. Be sure to shut off the alarm unless you REALLY want to notified of  every temp/humidity change outside your preferred range. Mount on the wall if you have little hands or pets who might be curious. Good performance and accuracy for the money

I got this product when my old weather station died.  As others have said, it is a bit bigger than you would anticipate, but not overly huge.  I hung it on my kitchen wall and the silver/black finish fit in nicely and now doesn't taker up counter space.

The weather station works as advertised.  It is very accurate... a lot more accurate than my last weather station.  It is very nice to have the clock update automatically via the atomic clock in CO.  Set-up was easy.  Price here was less than E-Bay and had free shipping!!  I highly recommend this to anyone who was looking for an affordable, entry level weather station

I have had great results with this feeder all summer! The hummers found it immediately and many, many hummers come here to feed.
The multiple ports seem to make the difference, and the glass orbs are easy to remove, fill, and keep very clean; I prefer the glass to plastic. This feeder is whimsical, fun to look at, and as for our local hummers; they seem to love it

I bought this product for myself a couple of years ago and love it. It's attractive and it does attract "hummers". Liked it so much that I bought one as an anniversary gift. Unfortunately when it arrived, one of the glass feeders was broken. It is being used that way, with the two remaining feeders, and my brother and his wife still think its great (though I was unhappy at sending a broken gift!)

What a great clock.  I was more than pleased with this purchase.  I was looking for a clock to put outside (I live in south Florida) on my pool deck so I could tell the time without having to either go inside in my wet bathing suit or take my watch outside. This clock is suitable for outside or inside use.  There is a twist off cover on the back of the clock over the mechanism to help make it weatherproof.  I installed it under cover of the eaves to give it some protection from the weather.  No tools are required to install the battery.  It takes one AA battery.

Not only is this clock very attractive, it keeps absolutely perfect time because it sets itself by the atomic clock in Denver at least 6 times a day.  I was most impressed when daylight savings time ended in October and the clock set itself BACK an hour during the night and was perfectly on time the next morning. 

On the back are 4 buttons for setting the time zone.  Simply push the button for your time zone to tell the clock where it is. All I did to set it up was install a battery and set the switches and hang it on the wall.  It did the rest.

As an added plus, it has an analog hygrometer (% relative humidity) and an analog thermometer that appear to be very accurate as well.  

I am very happy with this product and highly recommend it as a stylish addition for either indoor or outdoor use

Bought 3 of them.  2 are accurate to the minute.  1 is 1 min slower.  Not bad at all.  I'm in Rockville, MD 20850.  The silver bezel looks rather cheap.  (LOL, it is cheap plastic after all.)  May not appear as silver to some ppl.

I like this clock. This is a night stand alarm clock. And it does what it is supposed to do very well once it is set up.

The set up is not intuitive so you HAVE to read the manual and do exactly as it says. But it is not really hard to set up it's just not easy. You have to think about what you are doing. By the way the manual is large as another reviewer commented but it's because the instructions are in several languages not because it's so complicated.

The reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is that the plug which the AC adapter plugs into, which allows it to project the time continually, has too much space on either side. The result is that you THINK the AC adapter is plugged up properly when in fact the adapter has gone down on either side of the plug. It took me a while to figure out what was going on. At first I thought the clock was defective as some of the other reviewers did. That's a bad design flaw that needs to be fixed.

FYI it doesn't project the time continually in battery mode because that would quickly drain the batteries. In battery mode it only projects the time for about 3 or 4 seconds when you press the snooze button.

Once the clock is set up for your time zone you never have to set the time again, not even for daylight savings time, and you always have the correct time. The clock has a built in antenna that picks up the radio signal from the official U. S. government time keeper. Once a day it sets itself according to that radio signal. It also has sensors that tell you the indoor humidity and temperature.

We have a 7 month old lab who loves it. Its the only toy that we have tried that he can't chew through. And he chews through almost anything (tennis toughies, raw hide bones, etc etc). He has had it for 3 weeks and is still as fascinated by it as he was on day one.

I bought four of them for my front and back yard three months ago. They have been working well keeping the moles away, although the range is not a large as stated. I dug the hole for eash one and packed the dirt around the mole chaser I have an acre and a half of yard and I do have mole activity in the far back of the yard I will buy three more to cover that area. If you have a sandy yard I don't think that they would work as well

I bought this product about a year ago and it worked great.  Unfortunately, I placed it at the edge of our lawn and ran it over with the lawnmower, breaking it instantly.  After ours broke, I waited to order a new one.  I told our neighbors about my success and they all bought them, since ours was broken the moles all moved back to our yard.  Needless to say, I bought a few more.  They work very well, you do need to put the battery replacement on your calendar for every 6 months

Love it - the water sparkles in the sun light and the birds in my yard are already digging it!  The petals from my Cherry Blossom tree have fallen into the bath and are floating on top.  It is a piece of art in my yard.  You need to leave a little room on the edge of the bath so the smaller birds can enjoy the water as well. I know it will be enjoyed for years to come.  A wonderful gift my daughter gave me for my birthday.

Very simple to assemble - two steps.  The base is also weighted so it will not tip over and is balanced.  I have to see what other items are from this company.

This works well enough for what my son wanted. I threw a bunch of nickels out in the yard and he had a blast finding "treasure." Still hasn't found a chest of gold, though. But it is hard to adjust sensitivity and it makes annoying sounds.

After reading the reviews here, I decided to try a ZaGrill.

It works.  It works as claimed.  It works very well.

This is a wonderful addition to my grill gear, unlike some of the rubbish I've bought.  It has enhanced my standing as Grill King of the family.

Now I find myself thinking, why didn't I invent something like this

I really like the clock.  It works like a charm.  The only reason I took off a star was because the controls aren't as intuitive as they could be.  I keep having to go back to the instructions to figure out how to set the alarm.  Shouldn't it be obvious

This is great furniture folks. 
Many times I have thought that Amazon hired people to rave in these reviews but I cannot say enough about how nice this furniture is!
I bought 4 chairs, the settee, and b/c they don't have a side table in the Bainbridge pattern I bought the Shaw table with the ice pit.
I have recommended these to everyone, lol, the price has gone up $10 every week for the past 2 weeks.....get em while their hot

We are delighted with our new chairs and table.  The products were well-packed and came in excellent condition.  The chairs are sturdy, ample and comfortable even without the cushions.  The cushions that come with are very nice, but too thick for my liking.  The chairs have an additional feature of leveling pads on the bottom of each leg that can be screwed in or out to accommodate uneven surfaces.  The table is big enough for a full dinner for four, but small enough to still feel intimate. We now spend a lot more time on our patio

Never has grilling of meats and vegatables been done with such ease and success as it has been with the Brinkman Electric Grill and Smoker.  I have finally been able to say adios to burned meals.  I grilled a 23 lb. turkey that when cooked looked like the most beautiful stage prop ever used in an advertisement and tasted as though a professional cook had done the cooking.  I now own two Brinkmann Electric Smoker and Grill units.  One for the California home and one for my Alaskan summer home.  I can't leave home without one

I bought this item to keep track of the humidity in my apartment because I have a number of wooden musical instruments.  I has allowed me to keep pace with the humidity and know that I need to put moisture in the air to protect my instruments.  Any one who has things sensetive to humidity would do well to purchase one of these

The bench is comfortable and has enough weight so the wind does not blow it over. The cushion is real nice and it dries quickly plus it fastens to the bench with only two small velcro straps.Two people can sit on the bench in comfort

I read the review before I made the purchase. I was afraid that my wife won't like it but it turned out that my wife like this elegan garden bench too. This is the very few item I could remember that my wife like as she always thought that I spent money on useless junk and inventory for garage sale. Thanks to Amazon's special promotion (I bought it for around $120) to gain me some credit from my wife

This mitt works fine for me. I was worried that the size would be too small after reading the previous review. I don't have forearms as big as Popeye, but I am a 300 pound man and I have no problem with the fit of this mitt. This mitt really comes in handy when I'm dumping the hot coals into the grill

I ordered these glow sticks for Halloween treats instead of giving the neighborhood kids candy.  My husband and I were really impressed with the brightness and the length of time that the "glow" effect lasted.  We will deifinitely order these again.  We couldn't have been happier with the product, its performance, and the joy it gave to the kids and their parents

Let's face it, if you are going to spend over 1000 dollars on a grill, you need one very good grill cover and this fits the bill perfectly.

Not only does it protect the grill's sheen and surfaces, it actually hugs the grill and the grill shape still looks attractive, even with the cover on.

Also, we can't let anyone forget that the grill and cover were made by Weber (the best grill company on Earth) so, it has a good sized logo on the cover for everyone to be uber-jealous of!

All-in-all, a must-have for the Summit 625 and Summit 650 grills

I got this as a gift for my dad, and while the shipping was on time and I got the proper product, the packaging was not suitable for giving this item as a gift.  The box in which these tongs arrived (the actual product box, not the cardboard shipping box) was all dented and had weird stickers on it (I am assuming for some sort of inventory purposes from whatever warehouse this came).  Anyway, my dad isn't one to care about that sort of thing, but if I were to have given this to anyone else, I would have been embarrassed.  Neat product though.  Very handy.

BUT...it is ideal for us...we were going to get the mosquito magnet (which lots of our family/friends/etc...have), but then saw that not only do you spend money up front but have to buy all kinds of things for years to keep it going...so we figured we would start with this then if it didn't work we would move to that...love the technology description on the website for this etc...and when we hooked it up it seemed to work instantly...who knows that the weather didn't change or different soap we were using, etc..??? but one night we were sitting getting eaten alive by mosquitoes the next we plugged it in and we weren't....so....we weren't going to unplug it and find out! esp. with our three little kids to protect from them! It would be a 5 if we Never got bitten

This EasyGreen automatic sprouter is an amazing machine!  I had used the jar method with mixed results.  My busy schedule prevents me from being able to attend to sprouts as needed.  I decided to invest in an automatic sprouter.  I am very happy with this unit.  It was a good investment.    I personally feel that it is worth every penny.  

The set-up was easy, thanks to the clear directions provided in the manual.  It is very well built.  It allows you to connect several units together if you wish to expand its sprouting capacity.  It is made of a few components which can easily be replaced when they wear-out without having to purchase a new unit.     

The unit is connected to a timer (provided) which activates the mist generator for 15 minutes at a time.  I followed their suggestion to set up the timer for 7:00am, 10:00am, 1:00pm, 4:00pm, 7:00pm, 10:00pm and 2:00am.  This has produced wonderful results!   You can set the timer to a different schedule if you wish.

I put my automatic sprouter next to my kitchen sink which makes drainage very easy.   I had to fill the 5 liter reservoir manually every day until I decided to purchase the Automatic Water Filling System (AWFS).  This accessory can easily be added (you have to purchase it directly from EasyGreen).  It makes sprouting even easier than before.  

The unit comes with one big tray (for sprouting a great quantity of one thing) and 5 smaller elongated trays that can be used together(each tray grows about 2 cups of sprouts)  I put seeds in tray #1 and put it in the growing compartment of the machine.  The next day I seed tray #2 and put it in the compartment next to try # 1.  So on and so forth with each of the 5 trays.  On the 5th day, tray #1 is ready to be harvested.  I then re-seed it and put it back in the machine.   I also sprout beans and greens which have a different growing period.  (I keep track on a piece of paper of the type of sprout I am growing in each tray and what day it will be ready for harvest).  This unit basically allows you to sprout something different everyday.   

The EasyGreen gives you the option to sprout hydroponically or in soil.  I have not tried the soil option yet.   

I am totally impressed with this unit and I strongly recommend it to anyone interested in purchasing an automatic sprouter

This alarm clock has some nice features. It has two separate alarms, and each one makes a different buzzing noise. It also tells the temp., and shows different time zones. The only draw back, as other reviews have pointed out, is it does not project well with light. This doesn't matter in the night, but in the morning it would be nice

I bought this grill to replace a dying Charmglow model several years old. It had several features my wife and I insisted upon in our next grill, namely stainless steel grates, 3 burners, and a stainless steel finish. All in all, it has done marvelously in cooking everything we've tried from steaks, chicken and fish, to a full 30 lb. turkey. That bird came out perfect! The three controls are easy to use, the lower storage compartment is roomy, and all the parts are made with quality in mind. My only complaint is the arrangement of the burners, which are top to bottom (or, front to back, if you prefer) as you face the grill. A side to side arrangement would make indirect cooking much easier on the rectangular-shaped grill area, where you could have one burner off and two on, and still have plenty of room for whatever was cooking. Assembling it was a bit of a chore, and took me and two of my buddies about an hour and a half. One note of caution: READ THE INSTUCTIONS CAREFULLY AN PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE ILLUSTRATIONS!! We didn't, and didn't realize our assembly error until we were a third of the way though the job. No biggie, but this is the second grill I've put together, and they don't get easier. Bottom line: Weber makes the best gas grill of this type in this price range. I expect it to last 10 years with care, and am very glad I bought it

After gilling on an undersized two-burner Char-Broil for ten years, I decided it was time to upgrade to a Weber.  I have used the gril now for a few weeks and it is the best - for direct grilling, perfectly searing steaks, grill roasting, and even slow barbecuing.

If you're looking at this grill, you're probably also considering the other Webers, like the Genesis Silver B.  Go with this one.  For the price difference of about $100, you get the steel Flavorizer bars, a double layer stainless steel hood, a bigger storage area, and dual work surfaces.  A note on the design:  I thought that the LP tank is housed inside the cabinet below the grill - actually it is under the right work surface (not a big deal, but hard to tell from the photos).  The only down-side are the stainless steel cooking grates (extremely durable, but not the best for either conducting or retaining heat), I prefer cast iron for its heat-retention, so I picked up some porcelain-enamaled cast iron grates at a certain big box orange home improvement store before the grill even arrived.

Cooking on this grill is heaven.  We like to barbecue (low and slow, with wood chips in a smoker box), and this grill handled the task wonderfully.  On my old grill, even on low, the wood chips would ignite and turn to ash in about 15 minutes, giving the food a nice sooty flavor.  On this grill, even though it gets very HOT very fast, on medium the wood slowly smoldered just like it is supposed to do.  Great smokey flavor.  We'll be doing our Thanksgiving turkey on it this year!

Sure, this grill is a little pricey, but the quality means you won't have to replace it.  In the long run, a great deal on a high quality product

This is a great reading chair in reclining position. Then you can straighten it up, grab your computer, take a few notes, and kick back to recline, all with minimal effort. I got two of these black chairs for our uncovered deck last summer. The mesh dries off quickly after rain. 

I love these chairs--just writing about them on this cold January day is making me smile

This hinged grate easily allows you to put in extra charcoal or even move them around while still cooking food.  The original was quite frustrating, you easily could drop your food onto the ground while trying to access the hot charcoals.  While one should have bought the larger grill for cooking beyond several people, I'm stuck with my 18 incher and the hinged grill is a must have, I can guarantee you can't live without it or you'll always say I should have bought one when it's too late to do s

I read the review before I made the purchase. I was afraid that my wife won't like it but it turned out that my wife like this elegan garden bench too. This is the very few item I could remember that my wife like as she always thought that I spent money on useless junk and inventory for garage sale. Thanks to Amazon's special promotion (I bought it for around $120) to gain me some credit from my wife

I always have to chuckle when I see the phrase "atomic clock". I am sad to report that there is nothing about this clock that is "atomic" except the name (well, it's made up of atoms, so I suppose that is worth something). However, it does receive the WWVB radio signals from the National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Boulder, CO.
On the bright side, if this clock is typical, WWVB receivers have improved over the years. The last "atomic clock" I bought before this had some difficulty with reception. This clock does very well. I've owned it about 3 months, and I have placed it in several bedroom locations and gotten the "strong signal" indicator in all of them.
The external temperature feature also works well. Some external sensors and receivers I have owned have had difficulty connecting. This one has done perfectly at all locations where I have tried it (my sensor is located in the frame of a bedroom window, and is currently about 15' from the clock).
The clock is, to my mind, easy to use and set. I like that it has battery backup, and I like the ceiling projection (my wife loves that feature, BTW). The projection is bright enough and large enough that even a nearsighted geek (20-200) like me can see it without glasses when I squint. I also like the tasteful level of the alarm. The clock we threw away when this one arrived had all the subtlety of a nuclear power emergency alarm annunciator.
Overall, I like the clock and gave it to my wife after much hinting. It now sits on her side of the bed. She got it last week after saying "I thought for sure I'd get one of those for Christmas after all the hints I dropped."
I'd buy it again. In fact, I may end up buying another one.

The first thing I noticed about the Big Kahuna was the quality of the construction.  After a simple assembly process taking about 10 minutes; I fired it up and was amazed how powereful the burner was.  An average home stove's burners produce between 9,000 and 14,000 BTUs -- The big boy produces up to 65,000 BTUs (according to Eastman).  If that doesn't get your wok to turn red hot then nothing short of a jet engine will.

On the subject of woks; I didn't buy one from Eastman and I'm glad I didn't.  I'm sure Eastman woks are top quality but I have a very good reason for my statement.  Lodge makes an iron wok that is not only less expensive but also fits into the Big Kanuna like a key in a lock (with minor modifications to the burner's rack).  The base on the Lodge Pro-Logic 14-Inch Cast-Iron Wok with Loop Handles not only works great on the Big Kahuna but it also sits nicely on your stove thanks to it's flat bottom.

OK, the world isn't perfect so the Lodge wok didn't fit into the Big Kahuna's grill out of the box.  In order to make it fit, I filed down the four cross members of the grill about 1/8" on each side and now it fits like a glove.  This is a huge advantage over a curved bottom wok because the wok simply can't move and is much safer to use (considering the high temperature of the cooking surfaces this is a big plus).  Let's face it: nobody wants to hold their wok in place while cooking if this can be avoided.

I also recommend that you get an Eastman Stainless Wok spatula (also from Amazon) -- it's almost a requirement.

The only thing I would change on the Big Kahuna would be to add an electronic ignition.  I'll probably add one myself using outdoor grill parts.

Keep in mind that the Big Kahuna, the wok spatula and the Lodge wok are all available from Amazon which means that free Super-Saver shipping is available from Amazon -- resulting in a considerable savings on these heavy items.  You could easily pay twice as much elsewhere.

The weather meter shows temperature and moisture level in a room.  It has a large digital display that I can see across the room.  I don't know about the temperature; but the moisture level number "seems" to kind-of match what is shown in my humidifier.

The bottom line is that it is cheap and good, and I bought two of them -- one in each floor.

I've had several wireless atomic weather stations and they all looked somewhat cheesy in an obvious spot, so you find yourself tempted to hide it away and this of course defeats its original purpose.  The LaCrosse model matches our kitchen cabinets and is wonderfully functional.

A friend of ours lent us their outdoor fireplace and we liked it so much that we tried to find it online.  After a little searching, we found it on Amazon.  We ordered it immediately, and the delivery came in about a week.  It was fairly easy to assemble, and was very durable.  I like it better than others, because all sides have removable screens, so everyone can play with the fire.  The "only" critisism I have for it is that the fire-grate is fairly low, so it's difficult to put paper under it to light.  Also, it's best suited for short logs, as there is a bar that crosses either end that limits the size that can sit on the grate itself.  Otherwise, it's a well designed, and well thoughtout product

The part was first quality and fair priced. It fit my grill perfectly since it is made by Weber for my grill. The site is easy to use and the information is very reliable.I recommend getting stainless steel because they generally last much longer than the other types.A Weber grill is an item that,if cared for properly,will last for many years.So why not improve yours and move up to stainless steel- I did

My Weber was purchased in 2001 and has served me well.  The grill has never been covered and I live within 1/4 mile of the beach.  Eventually the elements corroded the original burner, especially the small cross-over tube.

Installation was much easier than I thought (15 minutes) with no special tools needed.  Now the grill and griller are happy again.  For less than $50 I've extended the life of my $550 grill by at least 2-4 years

Bought this unit primarily for brewing beer; the turkey fryer parts are a bonus for me.  The burner delivers a lot of heat to the pot, and there is plenty of regulation available for the burner.  However, I'm disappointed in the thinness of the pot material as I hoped for a more sturdy pot.  Some apparent tousling during shipment caused a significant dent in the pot, but I was able to pop it out.  Bottom line, though, this is a terrific value, about 40% lower than if I had purchased all components separately

This hammock stand is very strong and durable. It was easy to assemble. The only drawback it has is the cross bar at the bottom of the hammock when put together.  Before the hammock stretched out it easily turned over and you would fall on the crossbar.  We bought a piece of foam pipe cover and placed it over the bar to prevent anyone else gettting hurt from falling off the hammock

If you are a caterer or own a restaurant,then you probably can effectively use the 22" wok. I loved the idea of a huge wok, but failed to anticipate the challenges it brings:
1. I couldn't season it in a standard oven. I had to resort to using the burner to season it by turning it. It was a laborious experience.
2. I can't easily clean it in a standard sink. Good thing I'm cooking next to the hose.

Get the 18", or search Amazon for "Wok Shop" and get a 14" or 16".

Other than that, after spending 1/2 a day manually seasoning the wok, I've just cooked the best fried rice of my LIFE

I purchased this stainless grate set as a replacement for my 15 year old Weber Genesis 1 gas grill... my only regret is not making the switch to stainless sooner.  This grill has been a mainstay for my grilling for many years now and rather than buy a new grill, I chose to completely rebuild my grill - starting with the burners and finishing with the grates.  Amazon.com was extremely fast in fulfilling my order (free shipping for me ended up with the product on my door step in 3 days!!!).

Take my word for it, do not but the cheaper enamel grates - you get what you pay for.  My 15 year old grill will be "good to go" for another 15+ years

This burner is stainless steel and is very easy to install/replace. The orginal burners were almost 15 years old. We use our BBQ grill several times a week so it gets a lot of use. I would highly recommend Weber to anyone considering a new grill. Their customer service has been fanastic and their warranty great. As I said our grill is almost 15 years old and I see no reason why it wont last another 15. The red top looks like new. The cheaper grills don't last long and don't cook as well. We have cooked turkeys, hams, roasts and even baked with it (during power outages). It cooks very evenly and can cook at low heat or indirect heat unlike some other grills that are too hot even on low.

I bought 2 sets of these chairs and the matching table.  I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived.  They are quite substantial, without being heavy and their appearance is quite nice.  The chairs came with no assembly and the table was very easy to put together with the provided allen wrench.  The feet on the chairs are adjustable so that you can get rid of the iritation of off-balanced legs.  Overall this was an incredible value at approximately $650 for the set.  I was so impressed by the quality and price that I have since ordered the matching bench

I have had this weather station for about 4 weeks. It is working properly and does all the promised functions. Setup and installation were easy the manual covers all the needed points and has some good insights. The included monitoring program works well, but is not too deep and is difficult to modify or reprogram. 
Overall I am satisfied with this product and I would recommend it.

I bought the bounty hunter for my 9 yr old son and he has used it at the beach, sandbox at school, hiking trails, playgrounds to find bottle caps and pennies mostly.  It beeps when it detects metal and works very well.  We even dug up a mountain of beer cans at the beach... about 20 buried in the sand.  It is light weight, easy to use and detects very well

I just received my two chairs! I just placed an order for two more! I did a ton of research on patio lounge chairs - pricing, quality etc.  These chairs stand head to toe with restoration hardware, crate & barrel, pottery barn.  They are the perfect weight.. not too heavy, not too light.
They look VERY expensive. WOW - sometimes I think these review are written by the manufacturer because they can be so glowing at times.. but I am just a customer so pleased that I got these and that they are this great. I was prepared to spend $555 per chair from Restoration Hardware.. but I got two for less than the price of one.  Only other thing I would add though.. the cushions are not fantastic.  I am thinking about ordering more comfortable ones with the all the money I saved

This bag is awesome, I can't believe we waited this long to get one. The ad states that the bag will fit a 9ft tree, which is what we have, and it fits fine. You just have to take your 9 ft tree apart into the 3 pieces, then it will fit (don't think other reviewer did that). The ad should probably make a note that you have to take a 9ft apart in order for it to fit. Am going to order a 2nd one right now for our other 9 ft tree.

This is a great way to monitor the temperature in another location. It can either be inside or outside, but it must be within 60 feet of the main unit. Walls or other obstacles can reduce the distance. You can monitor up to three different locations.

The only problem I have encountered is that the main unit sometimes loses track of a remote unit. However, it always automatically found the unit within a few minutes.

This unit works well. The 90 foot max range is for a direct line of sight. Walls and obstructions can reduce this distance significantly. 

Oregon Scientific makes a number of main units and remote sensors. They do not all work together. Check their web site for which remotes work with which main units before you buy: http://www2.oregonscientific.com/service/sensors/default.asp.

The material is heavy duty canvas-like.  Very substantial.  Design is also good with the cinching cord and the straps that attach to the legs of the fire pit... but the thing fits snugly enough that I don't plan on using the straps.  I liked it so well when I got it that I also ordered the grill cover.  I liked it just as well.  These are great products for the money and are as nice as any covers I've ever seen. Note that they ARE a light tan color, though.  It took a few weeks to get used to that and not the black covers that I had previously had on my fire pit and grill

This is a nice addition to anyone's patio. The product came very well packaged in heavy duty double boxes with the legs wrapped in padded paper. Assembly took around 30 minutes. As others have commented the holes don't line up naturally and did require some "finessing" in order to get lined up, but really wasn't that difficult to overcome. All that is required for assembly is a 4mm allen wrench which is provided (although the end started to get worn 1/2 way through the assembly and required me to use another wrench). Probably one of the nicest features of the table are adjustable levelers on the legs. This seems like a good quality that I am confident will last for many years to come

I bought the whole Bainbridge collection and gave it 5 stars.  The table was exceptional also except for the manual labor of constructing it.  One of the drilled holes for the top didn't line up but I have a garage full of tools which helped me correct this problem.  Plan on having someone around to help put this together, it is a little difficult for one person - not impossible, just difficult.

Being an afficianado and collector of buckets, I was ecstatic when I came across this 2 Gallon Galvanized wonder.  It's beauty and wonder cannot be overstated.  It is quite simply the Mercedes-Benz of buckets, if I may say.  I ordered this amazing product and the days spent waiting for it were probably the longest of my life.  When it finally arrived, I eagerly ripped open the box and tore off the paper covering the Dover Parkersburg 610.  All the packaging wasn't even necessary, because this bucket folks, hold on to your hats, is made of METAL!  That's right, 100% metal.  As advertised, it is quite capable of holding water, but that moniker is far too restrictive.  This versatile container can hold equal amounts of *any* liquid you can think of.  To test it's claim that it holds two gallons, I went out and bought two gallons of buttermilk from my local dairy vendor.  I poured both gallons of creamy goodness inside the 610, and to my surprise, it held both gallons!  Then, of course, I faced the problem of having to drink two gallons of buttermilk.  Long story short, the 610 was able to handle the resulting two gallons of vomit!  Days later, when I got out of the hospital, cleaning the 610 was no problem.  The galvanized surface made cleanup a snap.  I have found countless other uses for this versatile bucket since then.  Highly recommended

When researching metal detectors before buying a Bounty Hunter Tracker IV for a Christmas gift, I learned that using earphones with the detector not only makes hearing the "beeps" much easier, but also extends the battery life of the battery in the detector.  We live in a windy, windy canyon area, so I knew the earphones were a necessity because of the constant wind noise.  My husband says that the earphones effectively screen out noise that would overpower the emissions from the detector if he weren't wearing the headset.  He's a happy camper with his Bounty Hunter Tracker IV and the Bounty Hunter stereo earphones

I bought these headphones to use with my Bounty Hunter Metal Detector. They do what they are designed to do. They help cut out outside noise and make it easy for you to hear those faint noises that are important when hunting for underground treasures. It takes a little bit of getting used to, but after a few days they are quite comfortable. Remember, they are for use with a Metal Detector only.

Purchased my first THGR168 Remote Sensor in Sept. 06 and a second sensor in Feb. 07.  They flawlessly send their signals to the Oregon Scientific BAR388HGA Weather Station.  I've yet to replace the alkaline batteries in either THGR168.  A third sensor (THGR122N) came with the weather station and is set up outdoors using lithium batteries; it has measured down to -25 degrees F during its first winter.  When I first got the sensors, I set up all of them side by side for a day.  The units measure temperature (C or F) within a tenth of a point and humidity--if the humidity is below 40% or above 70%, they also show 'dry' or 'wet' in the unit window.  A tiny red light flashes each time the signal is sent. I noticed that the temperature readings were fairly close, within a degree or so of each other.  The humidity readings were further apart, as much as 5 percentage points.  With 3 units, one outside, one in an attached garage and the third unit currently in the kitchen, it's a nice benefit to see the temp and humidity directly on the sensor as well as at the base station.  Using the wire stand that comes with the units, they can be easily moved from place to place.  There's also a wall mount for more permanent installation.  Reception has been excellent through as many as four walls and two floors; units are within 40 feet of the base station--I think Oregon Scientific claims reception up to 100 ft.  Only the outside unit's signal occasionally disappears from the command weather station--that signal navigates 4 walls.  Move the command station to a slightly different angle and the info reappears.  In average or better lighting, the read-out is easy to view.  An improvement might be a backlit button to see the LCD readout in dim light.  Being in direct sunlight or shade will affect the readings.  These digital units work well.  I wouldn't claim them to be precise instruments but they are generally accurate; nowhere in the specs does OrgSci make a claim concerning precision

I have had this unit for 2 years.  I had to replace the wind sensor under warrantee but other than that, I have been very happy with the unit. Wireless tranmission between the sensors and base unit doesn't happen quickly enough.  A direct wire connection updates every 8 seconds.  If you buy this unit, plan to run a wire from the sensor to the base.

If I had to do it again, I would buy this unit.  For under $200, you can't get more data.

One note - Humidity range is only 20% - 95%.  When it rains, humidity is really 100% but registers 95

We got our first GardenJewels window mounted Hummingbird feeder going on 6yrs ago. We have so enjoyed the birds right at our kitchen window. The birds get so use to you that they even continue to feed as we are at the kitchen sink right by the window. They are a hoot, they know who feeds them!!! We have gotten several for gifts for friends and they are all surprised and delighted with this product....It is so reasonably priced for such a great feeder!!!

I too had trouble at first and gave this feeder a bad review but after fully reading the directions the brackett with suction cups separates from the bottle . I suggest you clean the window fully , which I did and it has never come down , been up for at least a month. When you refill hold the brackett in place with one hand and slide the bottle up and off with the other. It also does not leak. Since the brackett separates from the bottle it is very easy to apply suction cups to window. Forget all that about rubbing the suction cups with friction to make it stick

When I first sat in this chair, I was sceptical.  I didn't think it was going to hold me up, and I thought it was going to be very uncomfortable.  Boy was I wrong!  This is more comfortable than my rocker/recliner in my living room.  The foot rest takes a little to get used to, but overall this is a great chair.  I can easily fall asleep in mine

I bought the whole Bainbridge collection and gave it 5 stars.  The table was exceptional also except for the manual labor of constructing it.  One of the drilled holes for the top didn't line up but I have a garage full of tools which helped me correct this problem.  Plan on having someone around to help put this together, it is a little difficult for one person - not impossible, just difficult.

This is a very nice looking and sturdy table.  A nice extra is they ship a small bottle of touch-up paint with the product.

The table may look nice now, but getting there was a pain in the neck.  On the positive side - it is very well packaged.  No worries about any damage during transport - not a small issue for many items.

That said, the instruction sheet included was for a different (rectangular) table with completely different legs.  Even if it was for the same table, it was in that hard-to-understand translated-into-English-using-a-dictionary vocabulary.  There was a nicely vacuum packed card with all of the bolts and washers, as well as an appropriate wrench that fit the bolts.  Unfortunately, there were 12 bolts in two sizes and 12 washers - but 16 holes waiting for bolts in the table.  All of the bolts were too long for any of the holes - even with the washers.

I ended up getting a bunch of extra washers and few shorter bolts at my local hardware store (if you need to do this make sure you get stainless steel so rust will not be a problem).  The bolts provided required between 3 and 4 washers each before they could be adequately tightened.

Whew - finally done.  The table is serving us well on the patio.  It replaces a glass topped model which flipped over and shatterred in a big wind last fall.  The open weave design is nice - very easy to clean the top.  Give me a couple of months to get over the trauma of assembly and I might give it 5 stars

I love to BBQ!   Hauling a conventional smoker and grill in our RV was both messy and awkward and took up too much room.   The Cobb Grill is the perfect answer for RV owners who are short on space but long for fun and flavor.
In addition it is one of the safest cooking units available and disposal of ash is easy and clean.  For travelers this ease of use and clean up is very important.   In addition you can cook a whole meal at the same time in a Cobb!   It is also one of the least expensive cookers there is out there and all in one small compact unit

I gave this as a gift to my Mom...she loves it and says she can lay back in it like a hammok. My Dad has also tried it. They had it put up on a tree in less than an hour after they recieved it from UPS. Mom says she can take it down and put it up easily without Dad's help. When a storm hits, this is a good idea. After visiting the folks,  I find that it It fits me(at 6' 2" and 275 lbs) I can now rate it five stars.  dispite the thin(looking) ropes, this thing could fit a circus elephant it's so strong(Hehe)

THIS CLOCK IS THE BEST !!!!    WE ONLY USE THE FOLLOWING FEATURES AND NEVER CHANGE THE SETTINGS:  TIME: PROJECTED ON THE CEILING.  OUTDOOR TEMPERATURE:  PROJECTED ON THE CEILING.  WEATHER:  PROJECTED ON THE CEILING.  IT IS SO PERFECT TO ROLL OVER AT NIGHT AND SEE THE TIME ON THE CEILING IN LARGE NUMERALS......WITHOUT SQUINTING ON LOOKING FOR OUR GLASSES !!!  OLDER FOLKS USUALLY HAVE TROUBLE READING THE CLOCK DURING THE NIGHT WITHOUT THE AID OF THEIR GLASSES......NOT WITH THIS CLOCK

as others say...the unit is very nice, but needs three major improvements.

1.  Needs to run completely on A/C power when available.  Right now, the batteries are the primary power source and A/C is used only for the projection light.

2.  The alarm could be a little louder.
3.  There is no way to make the backlight stay on permanently

Did TONS of research on a projection clocks.  This clock is SOLIDLY designed, worked right out of the box (must be patient with atomic clock), and has been extremely reliable.  Recommend this to anyone
