The Easy Language 16 is only useful if you're already familiar with the language you wish to learn.  I've been studying French for months before buying this product and found it to be helpful when I'm getting rusty.  The only problem is that it's hard to make out what is being said because the sound is not clear.  The recorded speakers also don't bother to slow down to give you a chance to understand or repeat what is being said.  This is good cause it's like listening to an actual French speaker and not a robot, bad if you actually want to learn how to pronounce what is being said.  It will also go over basic French grammar but is totally useless if you don't already know basic French grammar.      

I also tried to use this to learn Japanese.  Unlike French, I'm not familiar with the Japanese language at all so trying to use this product to learn it became a nightmare.  If all you want to do is learn how to speak the language it does have a Romanized version of the words and phrases to make it easier to sound them out.  Unfortunately the basic Japanese grammar and Japanese alphabet are all written in Japanese.  For instance, in the grammar section it has the past, present and future "I am"  it's written in english then beside it it's written in Japanese.  You can't click them to have it sound out for you.  In the Japanese alphabet section all it has is the Japanese alphabet and you can click them to sound them out but you really have no clue what you are sounding out.  So it teaches you nothing about reading the language but the test they want you to take are purely in Japanese.  I do want to learn how to read, write and speak Japanese so none of this would be a problem if it actually taught you how to read, write, and speak Japanese!   So my guess would be that you really have to be familiar with Japanese (NOT the Romanized(Romanjj) version) already in order to use this product.  Because of my experiences with this product I would say get it only if you know the languages you're interested in and use it as a refresher and nothing more.  Since I am familiar with French this product was pretty helpful but if I used this as a starter for the language I probably would have quit.  I'm searching Amazon for better Japanese books. So if you want to actually learn a language look to the books with the language tapes and CD's

My boss asked me to get this, so that he check out the Latin portion of it.

What a waste!  The only Latin on this CD is *Latin* American Spanish.

The interface was underwhelming. I needed to guess at what did what, because the controls are mostly icons. What's worse, there is no  menu bar at the top to help take the guess work out of using the program. 

Apparently though, the manufacturer did throw in an extra *not* listed on the back.  If you are learning the differences between US and UK English, its there!

I gave this one star, only because I couldn't give it no stars

I found this title messing around adding things to my wish list.  I only read the blurb on Amazon enough to see Haitian Creaole listed as one of the languages.  Today updating my wish list I took extra time to find out why this was rated so low since nearly every thing on my list is 4 stars or more!  How unfortunate to find out that others before me made the mistake I almost made buying this in hopes of it having Haitian Creole!  Very disappointing!!!!  The makers should be ashamed

They have the hebrew backwards!! You are supposed to read hebrew right to left-the opposite of english and this cd has it left to right. I find it extremely confusing. I know how to read hebrew and I wanted to learn how to speak it.
What a poor effort!

I just bought and installed this CD with the hopes of learning some Haitian Creole, and I, too, couldn't find it.  There is absolutely nothing on the installation CD that mentions either Haiti or creole... except the jewel case which insists it's there.  I'm so dissapointed I haven't actually tested anything else out:  I consider this a VERY bad start

I just bought this cd because I am learning Haitian creole, and that's one of the languages that is supposed to be on this cd. When I installed it, I was unable to find anything on the CD in Haitian creole, even though it is listed as one of the languages on the case. So it has been a complete waste of money for me, perhaps if I was interested in the other languages I could give it more stars.
It also says in the blurb that u can use any of the 16 languages as the source language, but that is not possible either, u can only chooose a few of the languages as your source. I am very disappointed in the false advertising for this product. If anyone can find creole on this cd I would be happy to stand corrected.
PS I contacted IMSI and they say the cd's were mislabelled, there is no haitian creole on the cd, despite the fact that it is listed on the cover

This dude is selling info that you can learn from ANYONE with VERY LIMITED computer knowledge.  All of the same info is on the net for free.

This product exists for one purpose... to steal from you.

This pathetic thief has gone through the trouble of putting together an eleaborate scam to steal from his customers by charging their credit card 80 bucks a month without their permission.  He could have used his energy and tallents to just make a good product... but scams seem to be his thing.  AVOID!!  This is the WORST company that I have ever delt with in my ENTIRE life.  

This John guy and anyone that works for him should be ashamed.  He is an embarrasement to his company and his family.  At least a mugger steals from me face to face... this snake is sneaky about it

Imagine that you know so little about a computer that you wouldn't even be here reading this review.
These discs are for your grandmother who still has the corded, dial, yellow wall phone. 
If you are a recent (one hour ago) immigrant from a sixth world country, and you need to forward the "Burger King Christmas Song", well, then you're already ahead of these "learning" CDs. 
(My apologies to grandmothers with corded, dial, yellow wall phones). (Actually, I kinda wish I had one!)

I installed a perfectly legal upgrade of Photoshop CS2.  It worked fine for a handful of months, and then it quit.  Technical support was of no help.  I had to reformat my hard drive and essentially rebuild my entire machine.  I am so frustrated about this.  I probably spent 100 hours with the data backup, moving data, reformatting, and reinstalling.  If I were a small business, I would be out of business.  All because this piece of crap program, which I purchased legally, decided to quit.  Totally unacceptable

Im computer literate and regularly use a number of varying programs from Visio to Logic Audio to MS Office.  After picking up Illustrator however, Im frustrated by the lack of intuition and steep learning curve the software offers.  Ive been told that the world revolves around 2 types of people: those who "get" vector graphic programs, and those who errrr...dont. Unfortunately, after 10 hours use and much manual reading, I fall into the later category. I dont plan to give up however and plan to enroll in a course. This decision was supported by friends proficient in its use - but who had difficulty demonstrating the  complex concepts to me. (Indeed, defining the direction of a drawn curve was as intuitive as metaphsyics or nuclear science!)
So my advice is this: Be extremely carefull if youve never used Illustrator before. It may be a breeze to those well versed in its use, but to an absoloute beginner its an extremely difficult program to grasp and you may be dissapointed to find this out after youve forked out your hard earned dollars for it.

This is the worst version of Adobe Illustrator to be released since version 9. Opens files that I've been using for years and then writes scribbled, unopenable 'saved' versions. Crashes. Can't save for mysterious reasons. Writes "version 10" files with text split into pieces.

Such a fine product! Really glad I paid money for it!!

I downgraded back to Irritator 10

I assumed, incorrectly, that Adobe's customer service would be professional and quick. I have called three times in the past two weeks and have had to wait, at a minimum, 23 MINUTES just to speak to someone. 
When I finally got my product, they sent the Mac verion rather than the PC version I purchased. I called again and waited approximately 30 MINUTES to get customer help. I had originally ordered the PC Standard version and asked to upgrade (and pay difference) for the Professional version -- since I still hadn't received the PC version. Customer service stated that they would ONLY ship me the Standard version to replace the incorrectly shipped Mac Version and then I would have to wait for the Standard verison to arrive at which point I could call again, and ask to exchange for the Professional verion - INSANE!!!  Adobe's call center is easily the worst customer service I have dealt with -- and I've dealt with some bad customer service

I use PDFs a lot and I must say that quite often I turn to Free PDF software to actually do the tasks that Acrobat fails to do. One area I have always had a problem with is the formatting of some documents in size and sometimes Acrobat simply fails to recognize them and so I switch to the Free PDF software which has no problems doing this and is easier to use.
However if you are a pro PDF maker who wants to add sigs and links and notes and chapters and all the other function tags including security tags then I recommend this product hands down as the best one. I just find that it is not always the best PDF software package in the world, but a good one all the same.

I would not recommend buying this one just to make standard PDF files alone. If you want to touch up those file then this is what you need to do that right.

The only redeeming quality about this GPS system is that it's cheap.  I used it on a 1,000 mile trip on the east coast the week after I got it.  The navigation is poor. I found that I often had to look over to the laptop screen because I was "off route" so often due to the poor maps. The system repeated the same annoying problems that I see in other feedback.

1) The unit would show me being off the road even though I was on an Interstate. In this case it would continually recalculate the route and diretc me to take exits to get off the highway and circle around. 

2) It directed me to make turns onto one-way streets in the wrong direction.  

3) It could not locate a POI that turned out to be a few hundred yards away  

4) It often did not know the correct side of the road for my destination  

5) It doesn't provide a chime when it's time for a turn.  It will tell you the turn is a half-mile ahead, but that might be the last time you hear an instruction.

6) In one case, it got me to my destination (at least close enough) but couldn't guide me back to my starting point.

The GPS receiver seemed to acquire and hold the satellite signal well. But the maps are poor, as is the verbal instruction - it sounds like a 1980's computer generated voice.

If you're looking for a trustworthy guide in unfamiliar areas - this ISN'T it.

This is going back asap.

I rarely write reviews but I decided to write this since I had this urge to let everyone know that this product is just plain bad.  The review by "Reviewer: RC Lansing Mich" has listed all of my frustrations and I will not go over them again.  But the rating of 4 stars that he has given does not agree with what you will read in his review.  

The summary of this product is that it is "highly unusable".  You will be tired of using this on your first trip that you will not feel like every using it again.  Yes, you can "manage" you way with this product.  However it is not worth your time and money.

And last point that struck a nerve with me about the ols maps database ... the company came out with a plan where customers can send them updated maps, based on locations they have travelled, not covered by the original map database ... come on!

I have used MS streets and trips 2005 and 2006 for over a year. It has some map errors that I wish were updated. I read that The Delorme Street Atlas was far superior, so I bought it. It only took one day for me to find a mountain of problems. Not only is the mapping way out of date (Many years) Microsoft Streets and trips 2006 Maps are far more up to date. On many occasions told me to turn the wrong direction on roads even when the road doesn't exist in that direction. It doesn't even know the name of some very old roads Displays..."Unknown Name" While driving on very old established roads it tells me to turn onto a road that is actually an elevated overpass that I am driving 30 feet below. The program actually wanted me to get back on the freeway by making a U-turn from an off ramp to an on ramp. I have used Microsoft streets in all of these same areas and it is much more usable. The Delorme is very confusing and frustrating. I'm sending it back for a full refund

There's a reason why this stuff is significantly discounted. This is definitely one of the worst products I have ever bought. I did not do much research. I think the data may be in there, but I could not learn how to make it work. The interface is horrific - unusable. Don't do it

Acrobat 5 was so buggy that I thought I'd give Adobe a couple of product cycles before upgrading. Should have waited longer. There have been improvements in v7: a better look, better commenting, the ability to add text that actually prints, and far better OCR functionality. But other basic functions are way worse than in v5: some Word documents that were easy to convert to pdf in v5 will not convert in v7, seems to be something to do with font license issues. Installation is a nightmare and repeated re-installation was required to get past system hangs, clashes with standard security software, and endless errors in the automatic update feature. The new product activation makes this even more of a pain because too many re-installations force you to activate by phone. Despite my already low expectations of Adobe, this product is a disappointment. With Acrobat 7, Adobe is, as usual, charging top $ for what any decent company would consider an embarrassing mess even as a beta version. 
(For reference, my system is Window XP pro, Pentium 4 3GHz, 2.5GB RAM)

The computer I have now(about 500 Mhz)is faster than my last one, and the earlier version of Plus! worked well with my older model. However, my current model can't process most of the programs available, so I just deleted the whole package. I intend to get a faster computer in the near future, and will use SuperPack at that time. The features look pretty cool, but I can't give it a favorable rating at this time. However, when I see how it would work with a faster processor, I may re-rate my review

This is the first time I have ever reviewed a product and I do it so that no one else will waste their money on this.  It adds virtually nothing to XP.  Too bad they didn't make it as interesting as their packaged media edition.  That would have been worth the money, but old Bill who doesn't want to be the richest man in the world would rather you spend money on a new PC to get that product.  The themes are nice but far too few for the price.  The games are a gimmick since you have to pay to play the real things.  The DJ is dumb and the dancers are cute but after a while boring.  Hard to figure out how to use the music converter and photo stuff.  Too bad could have been something but in its present form, not worth the money

I purchased this software thinking that I could take my digital images, create a slide show with music, and then burn it to dvd for the family to watch.
Unfortunately, the disk that I got gave me some error messages that when I called tech support (one hour hold time)they told me that my error message meant that I could create files, but they'll only run on my computer, not on my tv dvd player. In addition, you need to buy additional dvd burning software, because the dvd burning software imbedded in this software package will only create dvds that will run on a dvd player with the Microsoft logo on them. (The package says the dvds will run on almost any dvd player)
So I asked for my money back. However, since it took me more than 30 days to find all of this out, they refused a refund.

By reading the cover I thought it would be a great product to have. It indeed has some good items but overall this is something one can live without. 

Games - Bowling game is actually a teaser version. You can play only two lanes. Others cost you extra. Two other games are not exciting.
Themes and Screen Savers are mediocre.

I liked the analog convertor but not too much. If you can get input from any audio device, this program can convert it into a digital format. Alas it doesn't convert to MP3 format. Also you need to keep computer completely free of other load while recording otherwise songs will be recorded slow or fast, but not on the normal speed.

Dancers can provide some entertainment to young kids for two minutes but soon they find out that these dancers have canned actions. I liked Ben though especially when he gets tired of dancing.

Bottom line - I don't think you would regret buying this at 17 dollars but the novelty will wear off within a week.

I have to qualify this review by saying that I do not own PM 8.0, so I cannot fairly give a rating, despite overwhelmingly negative reviews. I can only relate personal experience with Norton/Symantec products. I do own and have used PM 6.0 since '01 when it was still Powerquest instead of Norton/Symantec and it has worked very well, though the GUI is a bit quirky. I have run it with 2 drives, one with 98SE and XP Pro, with PM loaded on 98SE partition and it did everything I needed on both drives. Trouble is, version 5.0 is, AFAIK, not compatible with XP and since M$ no longer supports 98SE, we have a problem, Houston. Currently I am  using a mobile drive bay to switch drives as needed. If I get a drive partitioning software product compatible with XP, it most assuredly WILL NOT BE ANYTHING PRODUCED BY NORTON/SYMANTEC, based on these reviews and personal experience with Norton/Symantec products. I first bought a computer in '98 and used Norton Antivirus 5.0. At that time, Norton was probably the best antivirus product out there. It worked flawlessly and I used and recommended it for years. NO MORE. I purchased a copy of Symantec System Works 2005 right after it was released. Long story short, I no longer use Norton products because I got tired of the system crashes and stability issues caused by the unstable bloatware and system resource hog that it has become, and am currently using a competing product that is very highly rated but is not common on the shelves of the big box stores. There is one lone Symantec product I still use---Windoctor, which is not installed on my 'puter but ran from the CD as needed.  Adios, anything else produced by Norton/Symantec. It ain't worth the headaches when there are much better products available for less coin.

I purchased Partition Magic 8.0 based on my previous experience with Symantec virus protection and firewall products.    

   I am sorry that I did this as the level of support provided for this product is vastly inferior to that provided by Symantec for other products that I have purchased from them.   All I wanted was to increase the size of my system partition on my C: drive by getting rid of some free space at the beginning of the drive.    I was unsuccessful in ever accomplishing this despite hours on the phone with Symantec Technical Support.   I was only able to speak to technical support staff in India who finally told me that they could not solve my problem, but that I would be called back by a senior engineer.  It never happened despite repeated promises.  I finally gave up and returned the product to Symantec for a refund.

I am an experienced computer user, and I bought this primarily on my previous experince with Symantec products, which had been good.  My experience with this product was unfortunately, very poor.

First - the product claims to be able to clone your boot partition, but this failed repeatedly, creating cloned partitions which were not bootable.  

Second - Tech support failed to provide an answer for days while I eventually figured out myself that I needed to use the bootable media to make a clone of my system disk - something the windows application was happy to try and fail at without warning.  Even when I attempted to provide this information to tech support so they could answer similar questions for others, they didn't get what I was saying and sent me another form letter response detailing how to make a copy (instructions which failed of course).

Third - On another occasion, even using the bootable media, I got the error "1517" when attempting to clone by boot partition.  Searching the web revealed others having this problem, and Symantec tech support full of bogus solutions for it.

Fourth - no support for USB/Firewire drives with the bootable media.

On the plus side - it did resize partitions I asked it to without trouble (I give it one extra star for something working)

Why are the newer products getting slower by the version. I still love Version 5. It does not forever to open up in a Web browser..

Update: I have been using Version 7 now for several months.. I am glad to say that I am now a lot happier. Granted it still uses a lot of memory. However, the new features that it has compared to Version 5, makes the upgrade worthwhile. 

However, watch out.. there are several features that Adobe took out from the Standard version and only has on the PRO version..

Being familiar with some Adobe products, we opted to try this at work as a cheaper alternative than some other packages for simple web graphics work.  Boy, were we disappointed.

Simply put, this tool is not so much a tool, but a hindrance.  Utilities such as transparencies, are not only difficult to make work properly, but hidden in non-intuititve locations.  Dialogs are non-standard, which requires getting used to strange layouts in design.  While seeminly small for just a couple items I've mentioned, multiply this by the supposed feature set of the product and you start to get an idea of how cumbersome the tool really is.

As has been mentioned by plenty of other people, it is also slow.  If you want a simple image viewer, find anything else - even freeware, as I have never come across an image utility that takes so long to load, regardless of it is the first time or the umpteenth time.

While I could go on about the unsatisfactory qualities of this product, I will simple reiterate what others had also said; it is cumbersome to use, slow to use and load, un-intuitive with poor layout and design, and lacks many basic features one would expect in this form of utility.

I am in agreement with others here who indicate that 4.0 is a downgrade from 3.0.  Performance is very poor, especially the organizer.  It's depressing to see how fast alternative programs are, such as Mac iPhoto and even the Canon software that came with my camera, compared to Elements.  Recently, I've been getting lots of crashes, though everything else on my system is completely stable.  The only reason I gave it more than 1 star is it does have some nice functionality, when it works correctly

I bought this software primarily so I could create slideshows with music and other special effects. Since I got it, I have had nothing but problems. First of all, it would not install completely on my computer. The techs at Adobe could not figure out the problem. After I reformatted my hard drive, I finally got Photoshop to install properly. Then another problem. When I burned my slideshow photos to a VCD, they came out just awful (unlike Adobe's demo video showing a perfectly created  slideshow.) Boy, was I deceived! 

I cannot say that this software is all bad. It does a nice job in correcting exposure errors in digital photos. However, if you want to create neat slideshows, Photoshop Elements 4.0 is not worth the cost

JUNK! I am a professional photographer and have used 2.0 for years for quick fixes and easy additions, thinking they might have made some improvements to make life easier... I was wrong. This program is a step back. I was a refund! I don't know who is writing they like this new version, but buyer beware! Laur

I just purchased the Hallmark Card Studio 2004 (...).  Everything installed fine but when attempting to print a card, the first side printed fine, but when printing the next side I keep getting the "this program has performed an illegal operation and will shut down".  I have been in contact with their technical support but have not had any luck so far.  I have wasted a lot of paper and ink so far in getting just part of a card printed.  I am running windows 98SE.  I will probably be returning this to the store (if possible).  It looked to have some nice cards on it, which is basically all I wanted it for, but for some reason will not print correctly on my computer.

The program works fine on Windows XP and is easy to use. It lets you print cards of many sizes. The big disappointment is in the number of cards that comes with the program. The back of the box claims &quot;4500+ Cards and Sentiments, Celebrate life's special moments with cards for all occasions&quot;. That's nice. The problem with that is that I counted the total number of cards that come with the program.  It only adds up to 1045! So where are the other 3450+ cards and sentiments? Are you supposed to design them yourself? I just don't know. And certainly &quot;cards for all occasions&quot; means just that, doesn't it?  Well there's lots of birthday cards and plenty of holiday cards but not one sympathy card of any kind. I guess you just need to buy those on your own

I've owned this software since it's ridiculously overpriced $500 1.0 inception.  Even at it's latest 1.5.1 $299 version Apple should still be ashamed of themselves.  I use Final Cut Studio and own 3 recent Macs, so I've been devoted to Apple to say the least.  I am a professional wedding photographer/videographer.  I have been more than patient with this software.  It looks great, up to Apple's standards in design and vision but remains absolutely plagued with bugs.  And unless you pay Apple laughable amounts of money (much more than the cost of the software itself!), they will not provide support on anything except installation...even if there software update is the source of the issue.  As someone who has been such an Apple fan, I feel obligated to let everyone know that unless you enjoy pulling your hair out and repeating tasks over and over again do yourself a favor and DOWNLOAD LIGHTROOM FROM ADOBE.

I have a Compaq Presario laptop with Windows ME. I wanted to upgrade it, so I decided to buy the Windows XP Upgrade. I have another computer that came with XP built in, and I like that system a lot.

Well, before I purchased this software, I specifically asked the manager at CompUSA if there are any problems upgrading from Windows ME to Windows XP. I was very specific. "No problem!" he told me, "It works great!"

NONSENSE!

Here is a list of hardware problems I had after loading Windows XP onto the laptop:
1. My touch pad stopped working.
2. My PCI bus started getting errors.
3. My wireless network card (D-Link GW-630) stopped working.

And these are just the things I noticed in the first day of using it!

I spent over six hours on the telephone with various technical service reps at Microsoft, uninstalling and re-installing the software, being put on hold, reinstalling drivers, restarting the computer over and over and over and over again... Six extremely frustrating hours!

Finally, the tech support people told me to uninstall the software. They said I should return the software to CompUSA.

Now for the fun part. CompUSA refused to take it back!!! After arguing with the very same manager who told me everything should work great, all I got was an offer to do an exchange for the same product. Then the manager said my system must not be compatible. Well, I showed him the "System Requirements" on the box, where it says "Windows ME."  According to the box, my laptop is perfectly compatible!  But apparently it's not.

Then the manager told me that he would not recommend upgrading from ME to XP. Well, intyeresting he says that now!  I reminded him about our conversation!!!

I even gave the manager my Microsoft Case Number so he could see for himself the problems I had and all the tech support people who tried to fix it for me.

In the end, I am stuck with software that does not work.

Learn from my trials. Do not buy this software if you have Windows ME. Only buy it if you can get a written agreement from your seller that they will take the software back after it messes up your system

Don't take my word for it that's a quote from the title of a recent post excoriating this irritating and increasingly bloated product on Slashdot. 

Be warned: Adobe has not learned its lesson, and despite the outcry that followed the release of version 6, this latest release of Acrobat continues Adobe's aggressive trend of intruding into your desktop environment, again, as in version 6 without providing an easy way to undo the damage once its done--in fact, it's now nearly impossible. Like earlier releases, this version of Acrobat adds startup macros and new toolbar buttons to your existing applications and adds menu entries to your desktop "right click" menus. Adobe argues that these are conveniences, but they are entirely unnecessary (for most of us "printing" to Adobe PDF achieves the same result, is much more convenient, and a more natural model), and clutter what for most users is either a too-crowded user interface (for those who don't have the knowledge or patience to customize it) or a carefully tuned one (for those who do). Unlike many well-behaved applications that provide obvious ways of avoiding this kind of intrusive and disruptive behavior (e.g. through a simple checkbox option in a settings dialog), Acrobat's "option" for disabling this behavior, once deeply hidden in the setup process,is now almost completely absent. To disable the "Convert to Adobe PDF" button that mysteriously appears in the Outlook mail editor, for example, one has to be sure to choose "this feature will not be available" from the "Microsoft Outlook" option under "Acrobat PDFMaker" under "Create Adobe PDF". Simply deleting the button using Outlook's toolbar customization feature will not work: it comes right back when the editor is next opened. Similar problems arise in Word, Excel, Visio, Project, and Internet Explorer. And there's simply no way to get rid of the never-used "Convert to Adobe PDF" and "Combine in Acrobat..." entries in that appear in the desktop context menus for files (even if one installs none of the Acrobat PDFMaker features). 

For the technically inclined wishing to repair some of the damage that Acrobat 7 does, there are complex but largely effective step by step instructions available on the web, but even the authors of these are driven to despair by version 7: ("Adobe has really pushed the boat out with Acrobat 7 and managed to screw Word royally") . 

In short, Acrobat will make a mess of your working environment, there's no way to completely fix it, and even the partial fix is a pain (and not well documented). (This may seem a minor issue, but if every application followed Adobe's reckless example, our working environments would start to look like strip malls, crowded with features screaming for our attention to the point where it is hard to find what we need when we need it. One of the great strengths of the personal computer desktop is that users can configure it in ways that suit their needs; no application should interfere with that.) 

Experienced Acrobat users will also notice that this version continues another frustrating trend for Acrobat (and most other Adobe applications): it is yet again slower to launch than the previous version. In fact, on my 2 GHz Pentium 4, it takes longer to launch than the entire Visual Studio .NET development environment, and longer than the boot sequence for Windows XP! 

There are other minor problems as well (arbitrary rearrangements of menu and tool bar items, etc.) but these two major flaws are more than bad enough. Unless you really need the latest Acrobat features, you should probably avoid this upgrade. And if the "improvements" in this release are any indication of where Adobe plans to go with future releases, it may be time to start looking elsewhere for a tool for digital document management. 

Fortunately, there's no reason at all to upgrade. Version 7 offers no usefully new features, so you can (and should) avoid this one (at all costs)

Obviously bogus reviews.  Version 6 was slow as a dog, so any improvement will make this more interesting.  Of course rasing the price to $300 and $450 is less interesting.  What about those of us that upgraded to the slow dog 6 and unintalled it to return to v5?  how bout tossing us all a bone

In an effort to boost their file numbers and appear to be more comprehensive, the creators included many VERY low resolution images that they "artsied" or "roughed" up with a dirty polaroid-transfer effect, or split up into 5 small stagger-stacked slides, which they must have hoped would excuse the poor quality of the original image.  

For example, if you do a search for "tiger", you will get 165 results, but only 86 will be of the animal, (and not one of 20 images of 10 toy tigers, or 5 images of one tiger-striped chair-cushion and so on), and of those 86, 80 have the crusty effect applied to them.  The other 6 tigers have been taken out of those same 80 images and clipped out of their background to give you a floating tiger on a clump of grass or a tiger head (but have, thankfully, not been "dirtied" up with the transfer effect).  Out of all, there is NOT ONE clean image of a tiger in its environment.

Here is another example.  A search for "sunset" yields 247 results.  Of these, 163 have the crusty polaroid transfer effect applied, and 70 are the same images duplicated (much smaller) in a sloppy stack of 5 slides. There are TWO clean sunset images.

These are typical results.  Numbers don't mean anything!  This product is stuffed with multiple images of toys, frankly not-so-attractive people from hard angles, and old low-resolution stock photos to achieve 150,000 files. Would it have killed them to include ONE clean, print-resolution image in each category? Perhaps we could have done without 50 of the fake slide images (talk about dated anyway!) in order to get a product worth having around

First of all, the many samples I viewed in browsing this software are the same object just turned different angles. There are far fewer images than the number touted. This is a scam in my opinion, but a situation I could live with.

But The major issue is that most of the photo images I have searched for my actual use have very poor, actually totally unusable resolution. They have corrupted clarity, Poor pixel quality, are distorted, and unsuitable except for perhaps, a third grader's school project.

It was a complete waste of money. It is headed for the first garage sale I hold, and I will offer it for 50 cents with a non-return policy.

This product is very nice when it works.  However, I'm having the same problem as the reviewer below me.  When I attempt to export the image - either by saving, draging or copying, Hemera places a transparency over the object, making the product worthless.  

I gave it two stars because, for the two months it worked, it worked well, however, now, it won't work at all.  And as the other reviewer stated, support is nearly non-existant

This product offers much to chose from and I really liked the photos. However, I have yet to get this program to work right. I am able to view the photos but when I go into the the Export Wizard to save the photos, the photo has a transparency over the top of it, instead of in the background. I tried bypassing the Export Wizard by right clicking on the selected photo and saving. This also inserts the transparency over the photo. I called Hemera in Canada and they instructed me to call Encore USA in CA for support. Encore USA said they couldn't help me. Encore's technical support is "limited to crashes, error messages and lockups". I also referred to their website hoping to find help in the knowledge base or FAQ's. There was VERY little about this software and no help to be found. I wasted my money on a product I can't use and that offers no support for issues out of my control.

I thought this would be a good product for my computer.  I didn't know that the only way to receive this product is over the internet via download.  During the process the prompts for the internet download ask you to remove (uninstall/delete) all of your known antivirus, spyware, and firewalls from your computer prior to install.  This leaves your computer susceptible when you receive an error message.  I received an error message that prevented me from completing the download. 

I purchased the software on Aug 3 and called customer support, they researched the problem and even took remote access of my computer to try and fix the issue.  They were unable to do so and then passed me to the second level of computer technicans.  Microsoft guards its secrets well and has varying levels of technical support, those that know the basics and those that know more. they asked me to set up a time span when I would like to receive a call from the "teir II" agents, I chose 6-9pm.  I received several calls over the next two weeks, all of them were outside of the specified time.  I missed several of them because I have a career and a life. 

When I finally spoke with an agent they again took over remote access of my computer and were also unable to solve the issue.  Here it was, two weeks after I purchased the software, I still did not have what I needed.  I was also unable to surf the web because the download process requires you to delete all antivirus and firewall software.  I called in several times druing the ordeal and the "teir I" agents just told me that I have to wait for the call, "they'll get to it when they get to it."  I was very upset with the customer support, I have no idea how the product is, but the customer support is just horrible.  Go to the windows live onecare home page and search for the "post your own thoughts" page through member accounts, you'll see that I'm not alone in this issue.  I have since purchased other software that cover what Microsoft says it will with onecare.  I did not have one problem with these installs.  

Please be aware that you might have to purchase technical support if you cannot download due to a problem with your operating system (seperate from onecare).  This costs an additional $35 ontop of the cost for onecare

This program does not allow you to switch to elevation and view or alter framing details. I'm only using it for a simple garage and I expected to be able to generate simple working plans with basic demensions. Not so. You might as well pick up a copy of The Sims so you could at least have some fun with it. If you want to get rough ideas this might be for you but if you actually want to work from it, forget it. Very disappointing waste of money

1. You can't print on anything over 8.5x14 paper.  Useless if you want to review your house to any standard scale.

2. I bought this thinking that it would be better than my 1993 version 3.0 of Broderbund 3D Home Architect.  It turns out that this is exactly the same software!

I strongly recommend looking for something better

I was excited to plan out an interior design project with this tool, but ended up disappointed.  They definately oversell it as an interior design tool.  Looking at the brochure online, I really think they must have touched up the images, because I don't see any way that they could have created them with this product.  As a matter of fact, the website Punch Interior Design software package implies that they did just that.

The reason I don't give it 1 star is that the video tutorial section is really great.  I wish all software had that.

As is typical with software claiming to be "topo", it is not. Expecting that the buyer of topos will typically be someone looking for USGS quads this software is not as advertised.

Since I own the other major competing program (for which you need to buy each state in order to get Quads (and for which I can not seem to find Wyoming)), I was eagerly awaiting this package.  In five minutes I realized Delorme is essentially useless to the backpacker/mountain biker (et al). You can order quads very simply using the package, but at the zoom level appropriate for making an ordering decision the wonks at Delorme decided they would make the map blank (apparently to force you into buying electronic quads at $2.50 a piece).  So, you need to actually know the quad you want before you order it.  Well, if I knew that, I would already own the quad, and certainly wouldn't need to buy an electronic version.  For 2.50 more I could get it laminated.

Yes, this is a flame, but it is deserved. Delorme might be great software if you know the quad you want; it is ridiculous software if you are trying to explore and area in order to decide where you want to go (and then download, and pay for, the appropriate map).

All in all, a complete waste of money--I only feel it worth my time to write this review so that the suppliers of such software get a clue and discover a more appropriate business model (versus selling blank maps, with a 100 dollar credit for maps that you don't even know will work)

Cheers.

This computer system, although almost universally accepted, can be beaten in quality and flexibility by an operating system that can be downloaded for free, such as the fedora project (a distribution of linux, a OS which can be changed by anyone for free), or bought from software company supporting these open source project with unlimited customer support for around 50 ($90) or less

Windows XP, and basically any other windows based OS is junk. After using Windows 3.1, 95, 98SE, 2000, ME, and XP, I was getting very sick of the same old boring basic programs.
Linux however, has tons of programs with a lot of extra features to it.
Spellcheck is one. I have to buy Microsoft Word or some other office program for spell check, and how much?!?! I'll tell you one thing, it ain't free.
Linux however, there is spell check, and not just in their word processor. I also found this in their messenger program, email, and even in web browsers, free!

The other thing I hate about Windows is "You must activate your copy, and only one copy per computer".
With linux, there is no activating, or "one per computer". You don't have to fear changing hardware and having to call in to reactivate, typing in a ton of numbers and answering questions. You can give someone a copy of linux, and they can try it, for free, and for life! It's not 30 days free, or free for only a few people, it's free for everyone for life!

As for one who mentioned that Linux releases more fixes than Windows, that is true. The difference between Windows and Linux when it comes to releases is like this. When Microsoft finally gets the operating system done enough, they will release it.
Linux will release free their OS/software right away. You can download it right away as it becomes available or simply wait until they fix the bugs.
So in other words, let's say both OS's have the same software. Day 5 comes along, and this software pretty much works, but may have some bugs.
Linux will release this, and you have the "option" of installing it and trying it out, or wait until more bugs are fixed.
Windows will not release this until it is more offical and finished.
This is why linux has a lot of patches, they give it to you when they first get it going, and as they continue to improve this, you can enjoy it right away and not have to wait so long.

It is also true that Windows can be attacked by viruses within hours, where as linux can take several days/weeks/months.
Also, Linux has been proven to give your hardware/computer a longer life span.
It can also work better with older hardware so you don't have to be compelled to upgrade all the time.

Why not try out linux? It's a lot cheaper, and you may be amazed by how great it really is. I prefer Mandriva 2006. It's a great system.

Final note -

Windows: Very costly, even more so to get the benefits/features
Linux: Free

Windows: One per computer, or buy more licenses
Linux: One copy to everyone for life, or each person can have a copy for life

Windows: Boring; basic programs
Linux: Several programs, multiple browsers, more than one type of software to fit your needs.

Windows: New hardware/reformat PC: You must spend time on phone and answer questions and type in SEVERAL numbers to activate your PC.
Linux: New hardware/reformat: Here's your OS installed; you're good to go!

Windows: Constantly gets attacked by viruses
Linux: Quite a lot safer

Windows: Support? lol. Yeah, there may be some
Linux: Various sites where you can ask questions for free and get help on your OS

That's just some of the reasons why I love linux

That, or purchase a new laptop, which was probably the point.

What a complete pain! ..... We now use Macs. However, I decided to take the California bar examination July 2006. The California bar examiners allow the use of laptops utilizing a software program written by Examsoft. Presently, the software will only work on Windows XP. Moreover, the California bar examiners will not allow any Macs, even the newer Macs with the Intel processors which require complete re-booting into Windows.

As a result, I was forced to upgrade my Gateway laptop, a fine laptop as far as PCs are concerned, in order to sit for this bar examination. (That, or purchase a new laptop, which was probably the point.) THANK GOD FOR GATEWAY COMPUTER TECHNICAL SUPPORT AS THE MICROSOFT FOLKS ARE CLUELESS:

Even though the warranty on my Gateway laptop expired some time ago, Gateway has walked me through more issues during the installation process than I can possibly discuss here. Conversely, Microsoft simply bounces me around from one tech support person to the next until the telephone becomes disconnected. .....

I suspect that the marketing strategy is that new software (any new software) will only work with the newer versions of Windows XP or Vista, and since Vista will be such a memory hog, consumers eventually will be forced to dump their PCs which cannot be upgraded, for new PCs.

As for how the operating system actually works: a grade of Fair. YESTERDAY, THE MICROSOFT UPDATE WEBSITE WAS DOWN WHICH, ACCORDING TO MICROSOFT'S DISCUSSION WEBSITE SEEMED TO BE A PROBLEM WITH OTHER WINDOW USERS AS WELL. Typical

I received the package and read the instructions.  In retrospect there were hints buried there that indicated this may not go well.  It did not.  My installation stalled out and would not complete rendering the computer useless.  I had to take it to a professional to get it going.  Even so, I have had problems with Internet Explorer stopping suddenly, BSOD's.  This is not a job for the average computer user

It is now almost a month since I bought the upgrade to XP Prof. for my destop computer running W2K Prof. I have had nothing but trouble. My notebook computer, connected by a wireless next for almost 18 months, suddenly could not connect to the desktop. All network setup and trouble-shooting help did nothing. I called MS and things got worse. Now I have an dditional problem (no sound on my desktop) and the first problem remains unsolved. I have been through three layers of MS technicians, only the last of which spoke English with an accent close enough to mine to be understood. Nonce could fix the problems and they are now "researching" the problem and supposed to call me this morning. During one of the calls, the tech. tried to blame it on my notebook. If any of you are old enough to remember when there was only one telephone company, you'll ercognize the situation. Right now, I would prefer getting a refund and returning to W2K

First of all, Microsoft needs to come down on their prices (Not that this will ever happen). I build computers for a living, and I'd say that 9 times out of 10 Windows is the single most expensive piece of any PC I build. That being said, XP has come a long way. Service pack 2 has done wonders for security. I also found it is the most stable version of Windows I've used to date. That's not to say it doesn't have it's flaws. It still lets in it's share of "germs", stops responding from time to time (hangs), and it's very slow to shut down. The built-in CD writing software is TERRIBLE and Remote Desktop is not always a pleasure to use either. However, the biggest problem I've had so far is with product activation. As a PC technician, I'm always testing new parts. The most annoying problem I've had is that after you make a certain number of hardware changes (let's say you replace a video card, a hard drive and add some memory) all within a certain period of time (180 days maybe?) Windows makes you reactivate. This becomes a problem when you have to reactivate twice within this period of time. It makes you call Microsoft, where you have to convince the representitive that you're not trying to steal from them. Then you have to read them a long number (I think 41 digits) and then they'll read another long number back to you that you need to type in. It's driven me to the point of using Windows 2000 again to test my parts, even though this isn't always practical for testing XP compatibility. 
Overall, I feel that I paid too much for this operating system.

There are issues regarding hardware incompatibility w/ specific components of the Toshiba Satellite M45-S355. The hardware incompatibility issues w/ the DVD-RAM drive, the GL910 chipset, and the SoundMax integrated audio drivers are known to both Microsoft Technical Service personnel and their counterparts at Toshiba. I spent an hour of fruitless time on a conference call with technicians from both companies (both of whom spoke what could loosely be descibed as "English"). The Amazon representative with whom I spoke was in New Delhi. I ultimately figured out (on my own) which Toshiba drivers needed to be downloaded (again consuming hours of download time with a 56K modem), and I used an Iomega CD-Rom USB external drive to load the software after about six extremely aggravating hours. I was able to avoid similar pitfalls when attempting to install Small Business Accounting 2006. Don't buy these products unless you absolutely MUST. Microsoft's "technical service" is a euphemism more aptly meaning "technically useless". There is nothing technically professional about the additional capabilities of Microsoft XP Professional. I should also mention that both the Toshiba laptop and the software were purchased from Amazon

...for InDesign to not have one basic features. Everyone I know still does french folds, but in order to see double page spreads in InDesign you have to lay them out wrong in the program, then you have to painstakingly go through your document and shift the entire document by one page, layout by layout. This is mortally stupid. At this point Adobe should have figured how a tool like I.D. is actually used in conjunction with a printer, not just assumed the user wants to print what they see on their screen. The oversight is the difference between avergage klunky desktop publishing software and a great layout tool. Why isn't there a button that toggles me between the layout view and priont output? Why do I have to slave over a document like this? Adobe, stop thinking in the abstract and investigate how your software can facilitate printed results.

Also who knows how you get an alpha path or clipping path into this? Mine shows me a heavily pixelated, entirely xparent BW image when it supposed to be a cropped color image. What do you want me to do with that

I recently purchased the software above only to find it does not support my dvd drive  (HL-DT-ST RW/DVD GCC-4482B (1.00)I have unsuccessfully tried to contact roxio support three times.  No response.  I did go through the long list of supported drives and also emailed my problem to Roxio.  Needless to say, I am very disappointed and do not recommend the purchase of this software. 
I have a new Gateway desktop that came with the above drive.

I found this program simple, easy to operate. However, when creating a DVD project I used a narration for my audio.  The narration matched each picture perfectly, when I decided to burn it all of the audio was thrown off.  Do NOT count on any tech support.  They offer an online chat with tech support but do not respond or are not online at all.  You have the option of forking over $35 PER INCIDENT in order to get a real live person on the phone- but it still does not guarantee it will help.  And now, I'm not even able to burn it!!!! I hate this program

I used Easy Creator 4 for years. Bought new computers so bought Easy Creator 6. It will not work on 2 E-Machines with XP. It wipes out CD rom drive so that it is unusable. I requested tech support 6/12/06. It's 7/15/06 and I am still waiting. I uninstalled it. I found Easy Creator 5 platinum on Amazon and ordered it. It works

This Roxio software has caused me the most bizarre and frustrating experience ever.  First, it doesn't work.  Second, I cannot obtain any support from Roxio to find out why.  They won't give support until you register, the only way to register is to follow a web link that comes with the software, and it takes you to a website that either doesn't exist, or is always down.  Thus, it turns out to be a complete waste of money, not to mention several hours of time.  RUN, don't WALK away from this software and this company

Loaded it on my laptop. It says that a compatible device was not found.
Went to website, downloaded patch. It said I had the latest patch already.
Everywhere you go on the roxio website, it tells you you can upgrade to version 8 for $20 off. It still is more than $50 and if Version 6 doesn't work, why would I throw more money at the problem?

I could find no usefull information on the website and no way to speak to someone.

I took it back to Best Buy. They said they could only exchange it for the same piece of junk. I went next door to Staples and they said if I bought software that does not work from them, they would refund my money if I bought it back within 14 days. So, I found a new source for software.

Pros: 
It did not crash my laptop
It did not cause the modem to dial international calls

Cons:
Doesn't work
no tech support
doesn't work
no tech suppor

I am very disappointed with this product.  Using the features of it are very difficult (red eye, sizing, etc.) in addition, digital photos downloaded into Photo Album 6 are of poor quality/clarity on the computer screen. I expected more from it but have found I have less.  I will not buy an upgrade but rather will look for another product with similar and more easy use features

I used a bundled package in a new laptop to create a photo album. When trial time expired, I purchase the full package. I could not open the existing album with the new software. The new full package is hard to use and the so called 1000's of templates can not be found. USE SOMETHING ELSE!!!
I even e-mailed Corel about this. Its been 4 days, I have NOT had a response.
DO NOT BUY!!! I RATE THIS PRODUCE AS A -2 STARS

It's to bad I can't give negative stars as this package certainly deserves them. This program is total garbage. A gargantuan waste of both time and money. 

Seemingly with every menu change, it recatalogues your entire photo collection, on ALL DRIVES, which takes HOURS (like 12+) to accomplish. And, while it will scan and catalogue all of the drives on your computer, don't even think about selecting a folder and expecting it to display the contents of that folder and all of it's subfolders. Ain't a gonna happen... but is will happily go through and catalogue them again for you, but, of course, after waiting hours for the software to finish catalogueing, it doesn't display the contents.  No, that would be way to logical.

After realizing that my computer had slowed to a crawl, I checked the memory usage and found that the Corel Photo Album 6 Deluxe was using 6 to 7 times higher than any other program running, and that includes Norton Internet Security, a notorious memory hog! Guess we now know what the DELUXE part is!

As far as I am concerned, Corel Photo Album 6 Deluxe is neither intuitive nor is it the "Best of" anything. It is a creeping, bloated dinosaur and a total waste of your hard earned money.

I am extremelly disappointed with Roxio, the makers of CD Creators; especailly Easy CD Creator 5.   I purchased Easy CD Creator 5, sometime back from an affiliate of Amazon.com.  It was dispatched promptly and in very good condition.  I installed it on my computer running Windows 98.   After some initial problmes it was running fine.    

A few days back I installed Windows XP professional on my computer, and I got a message that the CD Creator was not compatible with this version of Windows.  It hinted to contact Roxio.  I tried contact Roxio with the help of the link, but found it impossible to send them my message.   They have an automated "Roxann" that is so difficult to understand.  Next they invite you to a "Webticket" and you are supposed to mention your problem on it.   But when you submit your query or complain, nothing happens.  The site just stares at you dumbly!! There is no way to obtain Roxio's mailing address either.  So now I am stuck with this "Easy CD Creator 5" with no help from Roxio?

The first version of Easy CD Creator I used was CD Creator 4 basic. It was okay, pretty much what it said it was: basic. I got the upgrade to that from an Ebay auction and it worked pretty good. Later due to lack of support by the manufacturer for new CDRW drives in good old version 4, I upgraded to CD Creator 5 Platinum (The version being sold here.) This too worked pretty good - for a little while. Then the operation was moved over from Adaptec to Roxio, and from that point onward, things have been more thorny than rosy.

Roxio will REQUIRE you to register the product in order to download the (ONE) utterly essential update to keep this thing running. Perhaps you don't mind that, but I feel it's a somewhat minor invasion of privacy. Plus you have to keep track  of your password to the website and if you change ISP's you will have to RE-REGISTER. A hassle to say the least. Also , since Roxio took the reins, there are no further updates being provided. Instead Roxio tries to "encourage" (read "browbeat") you into getting the software upgrade for even more money. This upgrade will NOT work on Win98SE, which I still use for various reasons. So IF I were to upgrade the software AGAIN, I would also have to spend the extra money for a new operating system with all the faults and foibles that can introduce with other apps that I need and still use. If you have money to burn along with all those shiny round coasters you are going to be making, I applaud you. I prefer to keep a little cash for retirement.     

It is difficult if not impossible to get support from any real carbon-based life form, and the website gives little or no support for some of the issues you may face, such as getting "Illegal Request" errors from Direct CD, or inability to format or erase CDRW's that was once possible in version 4. Also, any CDRW's created in version 4 MAY NOT be readable with the new software, or at the least there are some technical issues with this. At any rate, it is not neccessarily all that "EASY" unless you are fairly technically inclined and understand (or are willing to learn) some of the finer technical points in CD recording technology. I prefer not to be bothered with it, I just want to create some CDs.    

I now find that some functions do not work appropriately at all, especially Direct CD, a program that originally provided the ability to do "drag and drop" writing of files to a Read/Write CD. Now I find that Direct CD is non-functional, and the only CD's I can write are CDR's, and there are problems growing in that area as well. Speed of the CDRW or brand of the recording media does not seem to be the issue. The software simply refuses to work as it once did.

It shouldn't be called "EASY CD Creator". Perhaps "IRRITATING" CD Creator would be more appropriate. 

In Summary: This does not deserve stars. Perhaps a few "BLACK HOLES"? While I once would have given wholehearted supported this product, regrettably I cannot support it with the same enthusiasm now.

This program is average to below average in it's abilities.

That said, just hope you don't need any Roxio tech support.
Why? because Roxio's  support bites!

You CANNOT contact anyone online or by email for help;
whenever their dis-functional "web portal" [web-based support] system traps you in an endless loop. 

I needed an couple simples updates for a pc that is NOT ALLOWED on the internet.

It used to be you could download Roxio's PATCHES from any pc having internet access. 
Then burn patch[s] to a CD, or copy to floppy/jumpdrive.
Then "sneakernet" the patches to the pc needing them.

NO MORE.

What happened today was that their webpage was apparently trying to download/patch a roxio product directly on MY pc.
[EZCD5 doesn't exist on my pc].

Instead of simply letting me download it somewhere, like to my hard drive, vs patchging it directly from their webpage to my pc,
[which won't work in my case as I'm not using roxio, nor have it installed on my pc];
 apparently the morons that did the roxio webpage coding make the download/patch process STOP/END and proceed to send the customer back to Roxio's initial patch download page.

When you need a patch, all these endless loops and support games
are enough to get me looking for a different product/different company.

If you want to minimize human contact with customers, fine.
But let folks at least download the patches they need in order to keep their pc going.
Don't hand over your customer support system [almost] completely to a WEB SERVER. 
That ignorant arrangement works about as well as when companies try to save a few pennies and get rid of phone receptionists for customer service telephone calls.
Then they let customers wade through a 100 layer deep voicemail system to find the answer to a simple problem.

IT JUST DOESN'T WORK.

If a company won't provide access to PATCHES, 
even after I have logged into their website with username and password, [so they know is accessing their patches] 
AND they  don't offer any type of 
FTP site  as a download backup  option, then 
I sure as heck won't be buying anymore of their products.

I see why Roxio bought up CeQuadrat and other companies.
[Though I hate to see such quality companies be devoured like that]. 
When a competitor has a better product, why fight to improve your prodsuct's quality/features, when you can buy the other company out.
 
Thank goodness Nero is not under the Roxio umbrella.

Despite many attempts and a complete reinstall of Windows XP, my XP machine refused to load Easy CD Creator 5 Platinum, rendering the progam disc and all update discs useless.

Probably if you already had the program running in a 98 environment and then upgraded to XP you could keep it running with patches and updates.  So take statements by resellers that they provide update discs with a grain of salt.  If you cannot install the primary program, the update disc is of no use.

The program is a good one but you have to run it on a 98 machine.

Acrobat 5 was so buggy that I thought I'd give Adobe a couple of product cycles before upgrading. Should have waited longer. There have been improvements in v7: a better look, better commenting, the ability to add text that actually prints, and far better OCR functionality. But other basic functions are way worse than in v5: some Word documents that were easy to convert to pdf in v5 will not convert in v7, seems to be something to do with font license issues. Installation is a nightmare and repeated re-installation was required to get past system hangs, clashes with standard security software, and endless errors in the automatic update feature. The new product activation makes this even more of a pain because too many re-installations force you to activate by phone. Despite my already low expectations of Adobe, this product is a disappointment. With Acrobat 7, Adobe is, as usual, charging top $ for what any decent company would consider an embarrassing mess even as a beta version. 
(For reference, my system is Window XP pro, Pentium 4 3GHz, 2.5GB RAM)

If I had $1 for every time a CS2 app crashed and made expend real hours to redo work, I'd have about $10. And that's enough for me to say, BEWARE of this set of applications! Adobe has allowed them to get too bloated, too slow, and the results are that all the programs (but principally GoLive, InDesign and Illustrator, in that order) are crashy and will quite suddenly, forcing you to expend the precious hours of your life redoing work you just finished. I cannot stress how disappointed I am in Adobe, and how distraught I am that we as a nation have allowed the only two competing companies to join, thus guaranteeing that there will be less quality and innovation in the future. In any event, do not buy the CS2 apps, Adobe does not deserve your support

Yeah, I know it's the industry standard, and it's powerful, and all that stuff.  But, MY GOD, what a freaking PAIN to use.  It's just plain tedious to draw anything from scratch.  While the interface in CS2 is an improvement, doing relatively simple drawings with primitive shapes and freehand curves still requires much more effort than it reasonably should.  Frankly, I could draw better stuff faster with 1990's-era Macintosh drawing programs.  The drawing issues are compounded by the fact that -- in true Adobe spirit -- this program is incredibly bloated and slow.  It's slow doing EVERYTHING... I've never seen a program so slow starting up.  And every time you save a file (even a tiny drawing with 10 shapes) you get a "saving file" progress bar for a few seconds.  It's also incredibly slow to shut down... frequently taking about 30 seconds.  I'm running it on a Pentium M laptop, and I know this is not a "graphics professional" machine, but COME ON!  Let's get the lead out!  I just get the sense that Adobe pays no attention whatsoever to efficiency or speed.  That bugs me a lot

Microsoft Office can be handy to have.  The files you can open, edit and create with it (most notably .doc, .xls, and .ppt) are probably the closest to universal compatibility among all your high quality options. It's (relatively) intuitive.  It has a pretty broad array of useful functions.

It's also obscenely expensive, considering the fact that you can get all of these things -- .doc, .xls, and .ppt; intuitive interface; and functionality -- for free.

I hunted up OpenOffice two years ago when I decided several hundred dollars was an insane price to pay for the ability to write papers, make basic presentations, or put together spreadsheets.  I was looking for basic functionality, but I was pleasantly surprised; OpenOffice does most of the neat tricks, too.  (Actually, it has a neat trick Microsoft can never replicate: it's open source, so it can respond to the needs of individual users.  You just say "Add this neat trick!"  and someone will likely be able to do it for you.)

It is possible that Microsoft Office has some killer feature you absolutely must have that OpenOffice doesn't.  But considering the price differential, I wouldn't splurge on this before checking.

Office 97 was a pretty good product. The programs were powerful, had a decent interface (maybe not as good as the Claris products of the early 1990s, but not bad), and came with a ton of features all on one disc. The Office 98 release for Mac was pretty much the same thing. The only thing that really got annoying for me was the office assistant (paperclip) but it is easy enough to turn off.

Office 2000 was a bit of a disappointment for me. I felt that the improvements were minimal (aside from a bit more stability in Word--anyone who has ever used Word 97 on a regular basis knows it's prone to crashing) and in fact detracted from the ease of use. One example is the clip gallery, which went from being one of the best organizers ever created to becoming a program that wouldn't have received decent reviews in 1988. Another is PowerPoint's outline feature. I always turned this off because it ate up monitor space and therefore made the actual slide smaller. When you use smaller displays like I often do this is a problem. The menus, which hide some functions until you go to the bottom of them, were also an annoyance. The manual went from being a nice thick book to one half the size.

Office 2003 continues making the program uglier. Now there are many tasks crammed onto one little panel on the right of the screen. Again, this eats into the workspace. The clip art system is even more cumbersome, and many of the clips are online only now. The help feature tries to point too much in the online direction as well. Now some people may not complain, but what if you're using a laptop in the middle of the country?

I feel that the program is basically an uglier version of the same thing that was first seen in 1997. In fact, the 1997 version was more pleasant to work with and almost as powerful. On my Macs, I've switched to Keynote for presentations and Pages for some of my word processing because the new Office versions on that platform are similar.

Some of the templates also look very 1997. Apple's programs are updated on a regular basis, and their templates look very modern. Now I know Microsoft adds some new ones now and then, but they should consider redesigning many of them--such as replacing the overused Arial and Times New Roman fonts with something a little more classy.

The program is bloated way too heavily. I can run Office 2000 comfortably on a 486 with sub-1GB hard drive, but can't even get 2003 on it.

A final gripe is that Access is not user friendly at all. File Maker is a better alternative, as it is easier to use and friendlier

Ok! Being the richest human being on the planet called earth, Bill Gates decided that he's not wealthy enough. So he released this Microsoft office 2003, which I really think is not much different from previous edition. The price is, as usual, very expensive. What's worse is that Bill Gates decided all the pre-installed windows in new laptops and desktops come with the trial version. So mere mortals like us need to spend extra BIG money buying the full version to simply do some basic documents.
I can see Bill Gates, being a deified bloodsucker, using $100 dollar bills as toilet paper, and laughing at us who work their butt off just to make enough money to live. SO SHAME ON YOU BILL GATES AND MICROSOFT

Microsoft is simply sloppy with their programming!

"Open Office" is a better program, is open-source (meaning if you don't want some paperclip's help, you simply don't download that part of it) AND OPEN OFFICE is FREE! It is also compatible with most of the functions that MS Office uses (and is upgraded with new features faster than MS's product, which is a rip-off!)

MS's Office 97 was the best of the Office suites, even though it did have it's problems, Spending the money to supposedly "upgrade" to this (or any other Microsoft product for that matter) is simply burning your money!) 

OPen-source software is FREE, it's perfectly legal, it is open t anyone decompiling it, so if you want to make your own custom goodies, you can, but then there are so many written by so many people willing to share, you don't have to develop your own, as there are already *SO* many freebie ones (and some low-cost additions by some places, but most are free) that if you want whistles and bells, or even a Christmas theme in February, you can get it for OPEN OFFICE! (Not so with this or ANY Microsoft product for that matter)

Simply sloppy programming - nothing more, AND you can get a fully functioning and compatable office suite for free legally

While Microsoft tries very hard to make Office "think ahead of me," they almost always seem to get it wrong.  The result is a package that consistently annoys me.  It is true that one can turn off the "helpful" hints and otherwise customize the programs so that they are less hindering, however the bloated package will nevertheless usurp your computers resources like nobody's business.  In my opinion, Office '97 was an excellent package, and the versions since then have gone steadily downhill.  As with many people, I use Office at work because I have no choice.  At home I've had good luck with StarOffice from Sun.  While not perfect, StarOffice has read and created files compatible with Microsoft Office very consistently in my experience, and it's a whole lot less expensive.  I am therefore hesitant to recommend Microsoft Office Professional Edtition 2003 to anyone except those who need the most advanced functions of Excel and/or need to use Access database frequently.

I bought this upgrade because I thought it would let me share my contacts. It says so on the box, but it doesn't. It works just like the old contacts which you can't share with others except if you export it. No live sharing. Why couldn't they make it so I could put the file on my server? Or on a secure site? Then all my office can work off one contact list.

50% or more of the time the business contacts can't be found when you search for a contact. It's like the business contacts is an add in that doesn't work with Outlook. Or you add contacts, save it, email to the saved email address and then go to find the contact later and it is gone. 

Also, lots of times when you try to SEND, the email won't SEND, it stays in the outbox. And repeatedly you open and hit the SEND button but it won't change to SEND status. Now, if you leave it in the outbox, sometimes that fools the program into letting you send other email. Or sometimes you can FORWARD and SEND.. Geez, what a waste of money this upgrade was. We won't be using it on any of our other computers and we haven't bought if on the new computers we have ordered.

Before you donate your hard-earned money yet again to Bill Gates' 'Feed the Multi-Billionaire Fund', do yourself and the world a favor and search for 'Star Office 8' on Amazon and read the reviews there. I use MS Office Professional 2003 in the office, and just cannot believe how badly so many businesses and individuals are being ripped off by Microsoft for this BLOAT-ware. 

Star Office 8 is under $50 from Amazon and is fully compatible with Microsoft Office, and includes full functionalities of MS Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Visio, and Access. Let me know what MS software I can buy under $100, let alone $50. Hopefully, this is the beginning of the end of the Microsoft Monopoly, and the dawning of the Era of Sanity in computer software.

I've worked with Pinnacle Studio versions 8.0, 9.0, 9.4., 10.0, and this one.  And they've all had two things in common:

1.  When the program works, it's superb.

2.  The other 50% of the time, it crashes frequently, and hard.

For years, Pinnacle had designed the market's top, novice-affordable video editing/authoring platforms, but for some frustrating reason, they just can't seem to keep the bugs out.  Studio Plus v10.5 is no exception.

Lately, the competition in this market has mushroomed, and there are better alternatives available for the same price.  At last, others have emulated the Pinnacle platform while eliminating the work/creativity-killing bugs.

My advice?  Shop around.  Google the competition.  But save yourself the frustration and steer away from anything Pinnacle

I used Version 8 and 9 and NEVER experienced a problem.  Version 10.latest version is terrible.  Crash and burn.  Don't take their advice and re-install your operating system.  Its THEIR software and not the OS.  Amazon and Pinnacle (Avid) continue to sell this product even though its terrible.  I read it was re-written for version 10 and they CAN'T get it right.  Nonetheless, they still charge full price and for support calls. The upgrade should have been free.

There are several good products now so Pinnacle isn't your only choice.  I changed to Sony Vegas and am very happy but it does a have a learning curve.  For super simple try Ulead or one of the others.

Pinnacle Studio can assist the amateur videographer in ... 

Hold on ... let me start again.

Pinnacle Studio can assist the amateur videographer in editing some fairly interesting ... 

Dang it! Give me a few minutes here ... 

Pinnacle Studio can assist ... 

(Samuel L Jackson-styled expletive) ... how many times is this gonna happen? Start and stop! Start and stop! Enough already!

One more time. Now, what was I saying? 

Oh, yeah ... Pinnacle Studio can assist the amateur videographer in editing some fairly interesting video ... if you can keep it up and running.

Got the idea?

Just adding my voice to the chorus of those have experienced the frustration of the Pinnacle products. This is a bargain-priced product for which you will pay the cost of long hours of irritation and heart-pounding races to meet project deadlines -despite the software malfunctions. 

After installing the program, installing the patches, uninstalling the program and patches and reinstalling the program and the patches, I am still experiencing too many crashes.

If you intend to use this program to piece together a video of Uncle Morty's birthday party, the family vacation or your neighbor's kid's bar mitzvah, the cost and the ease of this program may outweigh the annoyance of its aforementioned weakness. If, however, your video projects fit under the category of "job description," then I suggest spending the money for Adobe Premiere

Let me sum up this software "total junk"

Pinnacle will give you one free support phone call for help, then $25 for the next call.

They give you free email support, but answer everything but your problem.   They try and blame it on Windows XP, and will have you reload Windows.

I owned Studio 8, and it worked fine.   Went to Studio 9, and had a few problems.   Upgraded to Studio 9 Plus, and after a week of trying to make it render my projects with no sucess, and crash after crash, I removed it from my machine.

They sent me an offer of their all new 10.5 plus upgrade, Hollywood FX, 3 of their Premium packs, and a hat that says Studio 10 on it.   This said that the program had been rebuilt from bottom up.    This program should be called "Crash after Crash", and the only thing that works is the hat.

If you feel the urge to waste $100, and hours of your time, just buy this product.

Look at the reviews on Studio 10, and the other Studio products, and most only have one star.   Out of over 100 reviews over 95% had one star.   I found one with 5 stars, but looking at the reviewers other reviews he is obviously an employee, or share holder in the company.   He wrote a 1 star review on a Sony competative product, and 5 star reviews for other Pinnacle products that you would not own if 10.5 worked

I've been a user of Pinnacle version 8 (which I loved), and needed to update to a version that could burn dual layer DVDs.  What a disappointment this "upgrade" has been.  Crash after crash.  What is most disappointing is that Pinnacle built in a feed back system so the users could "help" them develop a better product.  This means to me that they knowingly released bad code, and used their customers as guinny pigs while sticking us for a $100.  Guess what, I don't want to help Pinnacle build a better product.  I want a product that works when I purchase it.

Lesson learned.  Next time I read a bad review on a product, I'm staying away

I was very disappointed with this program. But I was also thinking it would be more comprehensive and include more than just basic words and phrases. Even so, the male and female guides in the program often pronounce the words slightly different which can be frustrating. I learned more Icelandic (along with correct pronounciations) while in Iceland than I did with this program. And besides, anyone under the age of 50 in Iceland speaks English

I have owned eleven VCOM products and from now on, they don't have my business. The product touts itself in part as a vital tool when/if your machine crashes. If it does, be prepared to shell out the cost for another complete program. You are told that the program is already installed on another machine and you can't run it-although this occurs after a lengthy and cumbersome installation process. Sadly, customer assistance is no help-emails are unanswered and you can't get through via phone...What you do get from them once you register are constant emails about new products. Thanks, folks. Version 6.0 is also much slower than Version 5. Support for 5.0, by the way stopped abruptly when the new edition came out, despite the functionality of that program.   For the price, the software should work like a major player, rather than a dollar bin special.

An Internet search found complaints about not receiving rebates.  Why would they give you something for nothing?  

I have had several rebate problems and most of them involved free items or insanely cheap items.  

This "free" software could cost you $30 if the company decides they don't want to pay

Be advised, this Software is for a SINGLE USER, only licensed for one computer. I bought this for Home use after using SS% for 2 years and V-Com said it would no longer be supported of 03/06. I installed it on 2 home computers, it worked fine for 4 weeks, then it popped up a Box on my second computer that I couls not use it because it was licensed on another computer, I needed to buy additional license for each computer. When I tried to use it on my Main computer, it popped up the same message. So now it will not work on either computer. I uninstalled it and sent it back. Just because it's Cheap does not mean it's any good

I was using VCOM SystemSuite Pro 6 and it was working to my satisfaction.  But, after I reconfigured my PC to "Standard PC", the software rejected my Serial Number, claiming I was using the software on another PC.  I only own ONE pc.  Technical help claimed the serial number has been used on 6 pc's.  Well, that is totally incorrect because, like I said, I only have one pc and the software cd has never left my house.  They have a Bug in their serial number checking process.  Anyway, they would not help me restore the software serial number because I could not furnish proof of purchase.  They think I am a crook. I'm not, I only want what I paid for to work

  After purchasing the program thinking it would perform a through check on my Presario running XP Home all I get is a message that SSP6 has unexpectedly quite. I emailed tech support w/ the info, but so far no response after 10 days. There is no # to call for support. Maybe I overlooked something. 
  Also, I submitted the rebate form which came on the package, but was told that the seller was not participating in the rebate program and I need to check w/ them. I did and they said they shipped what VCOM had provided them, which included a rebate form if doing a competitive upgrade.
  Not very impressed w/ either the software or the company. Would never buy another product from these guys, even when the price after rebate is 0. LOF

I agree with others who said it crashes the system. Overall, I found SS6 Pro had more problems than it was worth--even if it were free, it's not worth all the time and effort. Besides all the crashes, downloading the virus/spyware updates via dialup TAKES FOREVER! Each download runs 1 to 1 1/2 hours. BE FOREWARNED.

In the end, I returned my copy to VCom, though to date I have not yet received a refund

I don't have a problem with the software.  It pretty much does what we need but reversing an error can be a nightmare.  Before I start this tirade, I should point out that the customer service reps were very nice.  But they don't have the infrastructure to provide the most basic level of service (please, read on).  The customer support system for the payroll upgrade on this product is really scary.  (1) They want to have access to your checking account to pay for the annual payroll subscription!!  (2) They DO NOT SEND RECEIPTS!!  I help with the books for a small non-profit and paid for the payroll subscription on my own credit card.  The only receipt I could get was a copy of the invoice, which is not formatted to print correctly on an HP1200 (duh!!).  What is really disturbing is that these people are supposed to be accounting experts!  If you acquiesce to the checking account withdrawal, the only receipt you receive is the line item on your bank statement.  Have they every heard of a "paper trail".  Well you sure won't get one if you purchase the payroll subscription for this product.  I will start looking for an alternative to Intuit because they obviously don't understand some basic accounting and auditing principles.

I was thoroughly disappointed.  The first few words I looked up in the thesaurus were not listed -- words like upholstery!  When I went online to see what I might be able to glean from their online site, first Fogware had not sent me a coupon, then I had to deal with bad customer service (I am not doing business with any companies anymore that give bad support) then after I finally got the coupon code they had left out of my box, the online info is exactly what we have in the cd -- so save your money and do not subscribe to their extended services site unless you need a spanish online dictionary also!  VERY BAD!  I am now going to go buy Roget's and check it out

Although this dictionary's contents are extensive, the screen functions are relics from the DOS era.  They are laborious and clumsy.  To find a word for difinition, it has to be spelled perfectly, there's no list of proximations to the word entered.  Changing a word selection is also clumsy especially in the thesaurus when the cursor doesn't show up in the entry slot. If someone knows of a better software, I'd sure like to hear cause this thing sucks!!  Maria McGowan

The description of this product on the Amazon site does not match what I received. Like another reviewer mentioned, the product was actually shipped from the UK so it took longer, and several features listed as being in the product are not there, specifically, exporting/saving of loops is not allowed, and there is no library of 1000+ loops included either. It seems to me to be basically like a demo version. Also, even though it was advertised as being new in the box, all I got was what looks like a (used) CD with no manual or CD key - so much for upgrading later! I am returning it. The SKU should be removed from amazon or the description should be changed to fit what is actually being sent out

I received this item today and was surprised
1) It was shipped from overseas (UK)
2) It came with only one CD instead of two like a previous reviewer thought
3) No paperwork - it came in a clear case with no artwork, info, etc
4) Sonic Foundry sold ACID to Sony in 2003 (according to Sonic Foundry's website) and SF no longer provides support
5) I can't get this to register online, which seems a little dodgy, but other than that, it seems functional. No huge library of loops, either. Can't really say I got what I expected

In installed this product on a Dell Optiplex GX110 (admittedly not the latest, but still a very standard machine) running Windows 2000 with 512MB of memory. In spite of spending literally hours with the software I was unable to get it to produce an outline or dimensioning of a wall being drawn by dragging the mouse, as clearly illustrated in the accompanying video. Without this feature it is virtually impossible to efficienctly produce exterior or interior walls. Multiple emails to Broderbund have produced autoreplies suggesting that I refer to their Website for help. This site is essentially worthless for all but the most fundamental problems (like not being able to read the install CD).

It would also appear that this product is picky about the hardware it supports and also the version of driver. Be prepared for possible frustrations with this product, with little support from the manufacturer. I cannot report on other features of the software because I was never able to produce even the walls of a structure

I've used CAD programs written in the 80's that are better than this.   I'll go back to Drawing Board 1.0 over this thing.  Not user friendly.   I can hardly draw a few walls without it crashing.  JUN

3D Home Architect is a complete crock. I have attempted to use it many times. After hours of reading and playing with it I am still unable to perform the most simple task. I own V1.3 of this software and it outperforms the current version by light years. I also spent lots of time trading emails with Broderbund in an attempt to obtain either additional product support or a refund and I got nothing. So henceforth they will not see another dime of my hard earned $. Sorry

I trusted that this software would do what it claimed to do and was so let down by its lack of performance that I am dumbfounded and left speechless.  During backup process I selected about 15GB of info to backup, spanning 4 DVDs.  Everything looked fine, except for TWO (2) simple errors that I received, indicating that those related files may not have been copied/backed up properly.  I figured no big deal, 2 files/errors out 15GB, I could handle that.  Based upon the false pretenses that my critical info was backed up properly (simple pictures, videos, mp3 files and Financial Files to include previous years tax files), I then proceeded to slick my drive.  Remember, only 2 simple, benign and almost inconspicuous errors during the backup process.  Everything looked great.

During the restore process, I then received numerous errors, each of them requiring me to click 'Yes' when asked if I wanted to proceed.  I got tired of clicking Yes around the 100 or so mark and decided to click no.  When you click 'no', EVERYTHING is undone; there is no 'ignore all' function so I had to sit through every prompt and got tired of it and decided that proceeding with 1000 files and answering yes would involve too much pain for me.  I then selected a smaller group of files to have restored, only the 'My Documents' folder but ran into the same situation.  Eventually I ran a test on a small folder to have restored and still ran into the errors but pressed through.  Hardly any of the files were received error free and those that had issues were never restored.  My guess is approximately 2/3 or 3/4 of my files were not restored and of course none that really mattered made it.

I had the latest update applied to the program, so that should not be the cause.  I would have done better to slick my entire hard drive without going through the backup process as I would have been at nearly the same place but without experiencing all the headaches, frustrations and an investment of hours, no DAYS of my time.

The program has been recently purchased by Microsoft for inclusion in the Vista OS, I imagine.  It will do well as a Microsoft product, as it fails to deliver upon its promises

All I wanted was a way to identify some files, remember which ones so every time I wanted to backup, I would press "go" and the backup would start. AlohaBob was too "smart" for my use. First, it has this intelligent file finder that finds what is likely to be backed up.  I indicate that I want to select my own files (which it lets me think I can do). Then thinking it would bring me to browser window -- no, no, no...it still needs to waste time doing its indexing as if I had selected the "smart find". I then manually select my files (great!!). In trying to save the "template" of what files I wanted to backup, it requires that I make it a reoccurring backup with selected backup frequency (YUK!!). I want to back up when I get to it (about once a month, not when it wants to -- I am backing up to a DVD which I need to put in the drive).  OK, so now I am over that and the backup begins - GREAT!!!  Upon returning into the application a month later, I can not select my saved "template" to "run now", it will run when it is scheduled to run :(  So...I need to repeat the whole process just to get the same files as last time backed up.  I exchanged emails with the company and they understood but were not going to "add" the features I described.  Oh well - it looked like such a promising product.  Now I need to find another that satisfies my requirements

I really dislike this software.  I'm the type that likes to customize everything and this program just is not made that way.  First, when you initially select files and folders, your disk choices are "C:" or "ALL".  I have several disks and I want to pick and choose, but this program makes that really difficult.  Then you have to pick a destination where the files will be backed up.  Choose carefully, because you won't be allowed to change it later!  And if you want to do incremental backups, be sure to schedule it before you do the initial save, because you can't do it later.  Basically the entire job, future backups and all, must be defined completly at the beginning and can never be changed without completely starting over.

800,000 images without keywords - the only useful parts of this collection are the classic and traditional .tif's that you can take into illustrator and turn into vector.  The high res images aren't, the clipart is less than microsoft office online quality and I've gotten far more use out of a 50,000 image collection b/c they took the time to keyword and catagorize the collection.

If you like to look thru a book and put in one of the 32 disks and then find the image - then this collection is for you.  If you want to have any sort of search capabilites, look elsewhere

I'm holding on the phone right now trying to get support for this product.  There is no 800 number for tech-support, so it's a long distance call.  I have had the same issue for over a month and still have not been transferred to a tech support person.  They offer only email support, but don't write back.  If you call them on the phone they tell you a support person will call you, but it never happens

This game was a little too hard for my tastes. Despite the fact that I played at the junior level I managed to get killed shortly after starting out. I also had to restart the game to figure out what my room number was because once I left the room I couldn't find my way back (all the corridors look alike). So far I've fallen down an elevator shaft, gotten caught breaking and entering, been crushed by an elevator, frozen to death and been hit over the head...I've got to ask is this really appropriate for children

The computer I have now(about 500 Mhz)is faster than my last one, and the earlier version of Plus! worked well with my older model. However, my current model can't process most of the programs available, so I just deleted the whole package. I intend to get a faster computer in the near future, and will use SuperPack at that time. The features look pretty cool, but I can't give it a favorable rating at this time. However, when I see how it would work with a faster processor, I may re-rate my review

This is the first time I have ever reviewed a product and I do it so that no one else will waste their money on this.  It adds virtually nothing to XP.  Too bad they didn't make it as interesting as their packaged media edition.  That would have been worth the money, but old Bill who doesn't want to be the richest man in the world would rather you spend money on a new PC to get that product.  The themes are nice but far too few for the price.  The games are a gimmick since you have to pay to play the real things.  The DJ is dumb and the dancers are cute but after a while boring.  Hard to figure out how to use the music converter and photo stuff.  Too bad could have been something but in its present form, not worth the money

I purchased this software thinking that I could take my digital images, create a slide show with music, and then burn it to dvd for the family to watch.
Unfortunately, the disk that I got gave me some error messages that when I called tech support (one hour hold time)they told me that my error message meant that I could create files, but they'll only run on my computer, not on my tv dvd player. In addition, you need to buy additional dvd burning software, because the dvd burning software imbedded in this software package will only create dvds that will run on a dvd player with the Microsoft logo on them. (The package says the dvds will run on almost any dvd player)
So I asked for my money back. However, since it took me more than 30 days to find all of this out, they refused a refund.

By reading the cover I thought it would be a great product to have. It indeed has some good items but overall this is something one can live without. 

Games - Bowling game is actually a teaser version. You can play only two lanes. Others cost you extra. Two other games are not exciting.
Themes and Screen Savers are mediocre.

I liked the analog convertor but not too much. If you can get input from any audio device, this program can convert it into a digital format. Alas it doesn't convert to MP3 format. Also you need to keep computer completely free of other load while recording otherwise songs will be recorded slow or fast, but not on the normal speed.

Dancers can provide some entertainment to young kids for two minutes but soon they find out that these dancers have canned actions. I liked Ben though especially when he gets tired of dancing.

Bottom line - I don't think you would regret buying this at 17 dollars but the novelty will wear off within a week.

This dude is selling info that you can learn from ANYONE with VERY LIMITED computer knowledge.  All of the same info is on the net for free.

This product exists for one purpose... to steal from you.

This pathetic thief has gone through the trouble of putting together an eleaborate scam to steal from his customers by charging their credit card 80 bucks a month without their permission.  He could have used his energy and tallents to just make a good product... but scams seem to be his thing.  AVOID!!  This is the WORST company that I have ever delt with in my ENTIRE life.  

This John guy and anyone that works for him should be ashamed.  He is an embarrasement to his company and his family.  At least a mugger steals from me face to face... this snake is sneaky about it

Imagine that you know so little about a computer that you wouldn't even be here reading this review.
These discs are for your grandmother who still has the corded, dial, yellow wall phone. 
If you are a recent (one hour ago) immigrant from a sixth world country, and you need to forward the "Burger King Christmas Song", well, then you're already ahead of these "learning" CDs.

I have to qualify this review by saying that I do not own PM 8.0, so I cannot fairly give a rating, despite overwhelmingly negative reviews. I can only relate personal experience with Norton/Symantec products. I do own and have used PM 6.0 since '01 when it was still Powerquest instead of Norton/Symantec and it has worked very well, though the GUI is a bit quirky. I have run it with 2 drives, one with 98SE and XP Pro, with PM loaded on 98SE partition and it did everything I needed on both drives. Trouble is, version 5.0 is, AFAIK, not compatible with XP and since M$ no longer supports 98SE, we have a problem, Houston. Currently I am  using a mobile drive bay to switch drives as needed. If I get a drive partitioning software product compatible with XP, it most assuredly WILL NOT BE ANYTHING PRODUCED BY NORTON/SYMANTEC, based on these reviews and personal experience with Norton/Symantec products. I first bought a computer in '98 and used Norton Antivirus 5.0. At that time, Norton was probably the best antivirus product out there. It worked flawlessly and I used and recommended it for years. NO MORE. I purchased a copy of Symantec System Works 2005 right after it was released. Long story short, I no longer use Norton products because I got tired of the system crashes and stability issues caused by the unstable bloatware and system resource hog that it has become, and am currently using a competing product that is very highly rated but is not common on the shelves of the big box stores. There is one lone Symantec product I still use---Windoctor, which is not installed on my 'puter but ran from the CD as needed.  Adios, anything else produced by Norton/Symantec. It ain't worth the headaches when there are much better products available for less coin.

I purchased Partition Magic 8.0 based on my previous experience with Symantec virus protection and firewall products.    

   I am sorry that I did this as the level of support provided for this product is vastly inferior to that provided by Symantec for other products that I have purchased from them.   All I wanted was to increase the size of my system partition on my C: drive by getting rid of some free space at the beginning of the drive.    I was unsuccessful in ever accomplishing this despite hours on the phone with Symantec Technical Support.   I was only able to speak to technical support staff in India who finally told me that they could not solve my problem, but that I would be called back by a senior engineer.  It never happened despite repeated promises.  I finally gave up and returned the product to Symantec for a refund.

I am an experienced computer user, and I bought this primarily on my previous experince with Symantec products, which had been good.  My experience with this product was unfortunately, very poor.

First - the product claims to be able to clone your boot partition, but this failed repeatedly, creating cloned partitions which were not bootable.  

Second - Tech support failed to provide an answer for days while I eventually figured out myself that I needed to use the bootable media to make a clone of my system disk - something the windows application was happy to try and fail at without warning.  Even when I attempted to provide this information to tech support so they could answer similar questions for others, they didn't get what I was saying and sent me another form letter response detailing how to make a copy (instructions which failed of course).

Third - On another occasion, even using the bootable media, I got the error "1517" when attempting to clone by boot partition.  Searching the web revealed others having this problem, and Symantec tech support full of bogus solutions for it.

Fourth - no support for USB/Firewire drives with the bootable media.

On the plus side - it did resize partitions I asked it to without trouble (I give it one extra star for something working)

I installed a perfectly legal upgrade of Photoshop CS2.  It worked fine for a handful of months, and then it quit.  Technical support was of no help.  I had to reformat my hard drive and essentially rebuild my entire machine.  I am so frustrated about this.  I probably spent 100 hours with the data backup, moving data, reformatting, and reinstalling.  If I were a small business, I would be out of business.  All because this piece of crap program, which I purchased legally, decided to quit.  Totally unacceptable

Why are the newer products getting slower by the version. I still love Version 5. It does not forever to open up in a Web browser..

Update: I have been using Version 7 now for several months.. I am glad to say that I am now a lot happier. Granted it still uses a lot of memory. However, the new features that it has compared to Version 5, makes the upgrade worthwhile. 

However, watch out.. there are several features that Adobe took out from the Standard version and only has on the PRO version..

Being familiar with some Adobe products, we opted to try this at work as a cheaper alternative than some other packages for simple web graphics work.  Boy, were we disappointed.

Simply put, this tool is not so much a tool, but a hindrance.  Utilities such as transparencies, are not only difficult to make work properly, but hidden in non-intuititve locations.  Dialogs are non-standard, which requires getting used to strange layouts in design.  While seeminly small for just a couple items I've mentioned, multiply this by the supposed feature set of the product and you start to get an idea of how cumbersome the tool really is.

As has been mentioned by plenty of other people, it is also slow.  If you want a simple image viewer, find anything else - even freeware, as I have never come across an image utility that takes so long to load, regardless of it is the first time or the umpteenth time.

While I could go on about the unsatisfactory qualities of this product, I will simple reiterate what others had also said; it is cumbersome to use, slow to use and load, un-intuitive with poor layout and design, and lacks many basic features one would expect in this form of utility.

I am in agreement with others here who indicate that 4.0 is a downgrade from 3.0.  Performance is very poor, especially the organizer.  It's depressing to see how fast alternative programs are, such as Mac iPhoto and even the Canon software that came with my camera, compared to Elements.  Recently, I've been getting lots of crashes, though everything else on my system is completely stable.  The only reason I gave it more than 1 star is it does have some nice functionality, when it works correctly

I bought this software primarily so I could create slideshows with music and other special effects. Since I got it, I have had nothing but problems. First of all, it would not install completely on my computer. The techs at Adobe could not figure out the problem. After I reformatted my hard drive, I finally got Photoshop to install properly. Then another problem. When I burned my slideshow photos to a VCD, they came out just awful (unlike Adobe's demo video showing a perfectly created  slideshow.) Boy, was I deceived! 

I cannot say that this software is all bad. It does a nice job in correcting exposure errors in digital photos. However, if you want to create neat slideshows, Photoshop Elements 4.0 is not worth the cost

I just purchased the Hallmark Card Studio 2004 (...).  Everything installed fine but when attempting to print a card, the first side printed fine, but when printing the next side I keep getting the "this program has performed an illegal operation and will shut down".  I have been in contact with their technical support but have not had any luck so far.  I have wasted a lot of paper and ink so far in getting just part of a card printed.  I am running windows 98SE.  I will probably be returning this to the store (if possible).  It looked to have some nice cards on it, which is basically all I wanted it for, but for some reason will not print correctly on my computer.

The program works fine on Windows XP and is easy to use. It lets you print cards of many sizes. The big disappointment is in the number of cards that comes with the program. The back of the box claims &quot;4500+ Cards and Sentiments, Celebrate life's special moments with cards for all occasions&quot;. That's nice. The problem with that is that I counted the total number of cards that come with the program.  It only adds up to 1045! So where are the other 3450+ cards and sentiments? Are you supposed to design them yourself? I just don't know. And certainly &quot;cards for all occasions&quot; means just that, doesn't it?  Well there's lots of birthday cards and plenty of holiday cards but not one sympathy card of any kind. I guess you just need to buy those on your own

I've owned this software since it's ridiculously overpriced $500 1.0 inception.  Even at it's latest 1.5.1 $299 version Apple should still be ashamed of themselves.  I use Final Cut Studio and own 3 recent Macs, so I've been devoted to Apple to say the least.  I am a professional wedding photographer/videographer.  I have been more than patient with this software.  It looks great, up to Apple's standards in design and vision but remains absolutely plagued with bugs.  And unless you pay Apple laughable amounts of money (much more than the cost of the software itself!), they will not provide support on anything except installation...even if there software update is the source of the issue.  As someone who has been such an Apple fan, I feel obligated to let everyone know that unless you enjoy pulling your hair out and repeating tasks over and over again do yourself a favor and DOWNLOAD LIGHTROOM FROM ADOBE.

I have a Compaq Presario laptop with Windows ME. I wanted to upgrade it, so I decided to buy the Windows XP Upgrade. I have another computer that came with XP built in, and I like that system a lot.

Well, before I purchased this software, I specifically asked the manager at CompUSA if there are any problems upgrading from Windows ME to Windows XP. I was very specific. "No problem!" he told me, "It works great!"

NONSENSE!

Here is a list of hardware problems I had after loading Windows XP onto the laptop:
1. My touch pad stopped working.
2. My PCI bus started getting errors.
3. My wireless network card (D-Link GW-630) stopped working.

And these are just the things I noticed in the first day of using it!

I spent over six hours on the telephone with various technical service reps at Microsoft, uninstalling and re-installing the software, being put on hold, reinstalling drivers, restarting the computer over and over and over and over again... Six extremely frustrating hours!

Finally, the tech support people told me to uninstall the software. They said I should return the software to CompUSA.

Now for the fun part. CompUSA refused to take it back!!! After arguing with the very same manager who told me everything should work great, all I got was an offer to do an exchange for the same product. Then the manager said my system must not be compatible. Well, I showed him the "System Requirements" on the box, where it says "Windows ME."  According to the box, my laptop is perfectly compatible!  But apparently it's not.

Then the manager told me that he would not recommend upgrading from ME to XP. Well, intyeresting he says that now!  I reminded him about our conversation!!!

I even gave the manager my Microsoft Case Number so he could see for himself the problems I had and all the tech support people who tried to fix it for me.

In the end, I am stuck with software that does not work.

Learn from my trials. Do not buy this software if you have Windows ME. Only buy it if you can get a written agreement from your seller that they will take the software back after it messes up your system

Don't take my word for it that's a quote from the title of a recent post excoriating this irritating and increasingly bloated product on Slashdot. 

Be warned: Adobe has not learned its lesson, and despite the outcry that followed the release of version 6, this latest release of Acrobat continues Adobe's aggressive trend of intruding into your desktop environment, again, as in version 6 without providing an easy way to undo the damage once its done--in fact, it's now nearly impossible. Like earlier releases, this version of Acrobat adds startup macros and new toolbar buttons to your existing applications and adds menu entries to your desktop "right click" menus. Adobe argues that these are conveniences, but they are entirely unnecessary (for most of us "printing" to Adobe PDF achieves the same result, is much more convenient, and a more natural model), and clutter what for most users is either a too-crowded user interface (for those who don't have the knowledge or patience to customize it) or a carefully tuned one (for those who do). Unlike many well-behaved applications that provide obvious ways of avoiding this kind of intrusive and disruptive behavior (e.g. through a simple checkbox option in a settings dialog), Acrobat's "option" for disabling this behavior, once deeply hidden in the setup process,is now almost completely absent. To disable the "Convert to Adobe PDF" button that mysteriously appears in the Outlook mail editor, for example, one has to be sure to choose "this feature will not be available" from the "Microsoft Outlook" option under "Acrobat PDFMaker" under "Create Adobe PDF". Simply deleting the button using Outlook's toolbar customization feature will not work: it comes right back when the editor is next opened. Similar problems arise in Word, Excel, Visio, Project, and Internet Explorer. And there's simply no way to get rid of the never-used "Convert to Adobe PDF" and "Combine in Acrobat..." entries in that appear in the desktop context menus for files (even if one installs none of the Acrobat PDFMaker features). 

For the technically inclined wishing to repair some of the damage that Acrobat 7 does, there are complex but largely effective step by step instructions available on the web, but even the authors of these are driven to despair by version 7: ("Adobe has really pushed the boat out with Acrobat 7 and managed to screw Word royally") . 

In short, Acrobat will make a mess of your working environment, there's no way to completely fix it, and even the partial fix is a pain (and not well documented). (This may seem a minor issue, but if every application followed Adobe's reckless example, our working environments would start to look like strip malls, crowded with features screaming for our attention to the point where it is hard to find what we need when we need it. One of the great strengths of the personal computer desktop is that users can configure it in ways that suit their needs; no application should interfere with that.) 

Experienced Acrobat users will also notice that this version continues another frustrating trend for Acrobat (and most other Adobe applications): it is yet again slower to launch than the previous version. In fact, on my 2 GHz Pentium 4, it takes longer to launch than the entire Visual Studio .NET development environment, and longer than the boot sequence for Windows XP! 

There are other minor problems as well (arbitrary rearrangements of menu and tool bar items, etc.) but these two major flaws are more than bad enough. Unless you really need the latest Acrobat features, you should probably avoid this upgrade. And if the "improvements" in this release are any indication of where Adobe plans to go with future releases, it may be time to start looking elsewhere for a tool for digital document management. 

Fortunately, there's no reason at all to upgrade. Version 7 offers no usefully new features, so you can (and should) avoid this one (at all costs)

Obviously bogus reviews.  Version 6 was slow as a dog, so any improvement will make this more interesting.  Of course rasing the price to $300 and $450 is less interesting.  What about those of us that upgraded to the slow dog 6 and unintalled it to return to v5?  how bout tossing us all a bone

In an effort to boost their file numbers and appear to be more comprehensive, the creators included many VERY low resolution images that they "artsied" or "roughed" up with a dirty polaroid-transfer effect, or split up into 5 small stagger-stacked slides, which they must have hoped would excuse the poor quality of the original image.  

For example, if you do a search for "tiger", you will get 165 results, but only 86 will be of the animal, (and not one of 20 images of 10 toy tigers, or 5 images of one tiger-striped chair-cushion and so on), and of those 86, 80 have the crusty effect applied to them.  The other 6 tigers have been taken out of those same 80 images and clipped out of their background to give you a floating tiger on a clump of grass or a tiger head (but have, thankfully, not been "dirtied" up with the transfer effect).  Out of all, there is NOT ONE clean image of a tiger in its environment.

Here is another example.  A search for "sunset" yields 247 results.  Of these, 163 have the crusty polaroid transfer effect applied, and 70 are the same images duplicated (much smaller) in a sloppy stack of 5 slides. There are TWO clean sunset images.

These are typical results.  Numbers don't mean anything!  This product is stuffed with multiple images of toys, frankly not-so-attractive people from hard angles, and old low-resolution stock photos to achieve 150,000 files. Would it have killed them to include ONE clean, print-resolution image in each category? Perhaps we could have done without 50 of the fake slide images (talk about dated anyway!) in order to get a product worth having around

First of all, the many samples I viewed in browsing this software are the same object just turned different angles. There are far fewer images than the number touted. This is a scam in my opinion, but a situation I could live with.

But The major issue is that most of the photo images I have searched for my actual use have very poor, actually totally unusable resolution. They have corrupted clarity, Poor pixel quality, are distorted, and unsuitable except for perhaps, a third grader's school project.

It was a complete waste of money. It is headed for the first garage sale I hold, and I will offer it for 50 cents with a non-return policy.

This product is very nice when it works.  However, I'm having the same problem as the reviewer below me.  When I attempt to export the image - either by saving, draging or copying, Hemera places a transparency over the object, making the product worthless.  

I gave it two stars because, for the two months it worked, it worked well, however, now, it won't work at all.  And as the other reviewer stated, support is nearly non-existant

This product offers much to chose from and I really liked the photos. However, I have yet to get this program to work right. I am able to view the photos but when I go into the the Export Wizard to save the photos, the photo has a transparency over the top of it, instead of in the background. I tried bypassing the Export Wizard by right clicking on the selected photo and saving. This also inserts the transparency over the photo. I called Hemera in Canada and they instructed me to call Encore USA in CA for support. Encore USA said they couldn't help me. Encore's technical support is "limited to crashes, error messages and lockups". I also referred to their website hoping to find help in the knowledge base or FAQ's. There was VERY little about this software and no help to be found. I wasted my money on a product I can't use and that offers no support for issues out of my control.

I thought this would be a good product for my computer.  I didn't know that the only way to receive this product is over the internet via download.  During the process the prompts for the internet download ask you to remove (uninstall/delete) all of your known antivirus, spyware, and firewalls from your computer prior to install.  This leaves your computer susceptible when you receive an error message.  I received an error message that prevented me from completing the download. 

I purchased the software on Aug 3 and called customer support, they researched the problem and even took remote access of my computer to try and fix the issue.  They were unable to do so and then passed me to the second level of computer technicans.  Microsoft guards its secrets well and has varying levels of technical support, those that know the basics and those that know more. they asked me to set up a time span when I would like to receive a call from the "teir II" agents, I chose 6-9pm.  I received several calls over the next two weeks, all of them were outside of the specified time.  I missed several of them because I have a career and a life. 

When I finally spoke with an agent they again took over remote access of my computer and were also unable to solve the issue.  Here it was, two weeks after I purchased the software, I still did not have what I needed.  I was also unable to surf the web because the download process requires you to delete all antivirus and firewall software.  I called in several times druing the ordeal and the "teir I" agents just told me that I have to wait for the call, "they'll get to it when they get to it."  I was very upset with the customer support, I have no idea how the product is, but the customer support is just horrible.  Go to the windows live onecare home page and search for the "post your own thoughts" page through member accounts, you'll see that I'm not alone in this issue.  I have since purchased other software that cover what Microsoft says it will with onecare.  I did not have one problem with these installs.  

Please be aware that you might have to purchase technical support if you cannot download due to a problem with your operating system (seperate from onecare).  This costs an additional $35 ontop of the cost for onecare

Im computer literate and regularly use a number of varying programs from Visio to Logic Audio to MS Office.  After picking up Illustrator however, Im frustrated by the lack of intuition and steep learning curve the software offers.  Ive been told that the world revolves around 2 types of people: those who "get" vector graphic programs, and those who errrr...dont. Unfortunately, after 10 hours use and much manual reading, I fall into the later category. I dont plan to give up however and plan to enroll in a course. This decision was supported by friends proficient in its use - but who had difficulty demonstrating the  complex concepts to me. (Indeed, defining the direction of a drawn curve was as intuitive as metaphsyics or nuclear science!)
So my advice is this: Be extremely carefull if youve never used Illustrator before. It may be a breeze to those well versed in its use, but to an absoloute beginner its an extremely difficult program to grasp and you may be dissapointed to find this out after youve forked out your hard earned dollars for it.

This is the worst version of Adobe Illustrator to be released since version 9. Opens files that I've been using for years and then writes scribbled, unopenable 'saved' versions. Crashes. Can't save for mysterious reasons. Writes "version 10" files with text split into pieces.

Such a fine product! Really glad I paid money for it!!

I downgraded back to Irritator 10

I bought this product after reading the other on-line reviews saying how easy it was to use. I am someone who works with computers daily and this was anything but easy! It was hard to understand and getting someone from their help desk to assist was a joke! I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone unless you're a professional architect/ computer genius

This program does not allow you to switch to elevation and view or alter framing details. I'm only using it for a simple garage and I expected to be able to generate simple working plans with basic demensions. Not so. You might as well pick up a copy of The Sims so you could at least have some fun with it. If you want to get rough ideas this might be for you but if you actually want to work from it, forget it. Very disappointing waste of money

1. You can't print on anything over 8.5x14 paper.  Useless if you want to review your house to any standard scale.

2. I bought this thinking that it would be better than my 1993 version 3.0 of Broderbund 3D Home Architect.  It turns out that this is exactly the same software!

I strongly recommend looking for something better

I was excited to plan out an interior design project with this tool, but ended up disappointed.  They definately oversell it as an interior design tool.  Looking at the brochure online, I really think they must have touched up the images, because I don't see any way that they could have created them with this product.  As a matter of fact, the website Punch Interior Design software package implies that they did just that.

The reason I don't give it 1 star is that the video tutorial section is really great.  I wish all software had that.

As is typical with software claiming to be "topo", it is not. Expecting that the buyer of topos will typically be someone looking for USGS quads this software is not as advertised.

Since I own the other major competing program (for which you need to buy each state in order to get Quads (and for which I can not seem to find Wyoming)), I was eagerly awaiting this package.  In five minutes I realized Delorme is essentially useless to the backpacker/mountain biker (et al). You can order quads very simply using the package, but at the zoom level appropriate for making an ordering decision the wonks at Delorme decided they would make the map blank (apparently to force you into buying electronic quads at $2.50 a piece).  So, you need to actually know the quad you want before you order it.  Well, if I knew that, I would already own the quad, and certainly wouldn't need to buy an electronic version.  For 2.50 more I could get it laminated.

Yes, this is a flame, but it is deserved. Delorme might be great software if you know the quad you want; it is ridiculous software if you are trying to explore and area in order to decide where you want to go (and then download, and pay for, the appropriate map).

All in all, a complete waste of money--I only feel it worth my time to write this review so that the suppliers of such software get a clue and discover a more appropriate business model (versus selling blank maps, with a 100 dollar credit for maps that you don't even know will work)

Cheers.

Windows XP, and basically any other windows based OS is junk. After using Windows 3.1, 95, 98SE, 2000, ME, and XP, I was getting very sick of the same old boring basic programs.
Linux however, has tons of programs with a lot of extra features to it.
Spellcheck is one. I have to buy Microsoft Word or some other office program for spell check, and how much?!?! I'll tell you one thing, it ain't free.
Linux however, there is spell check, and not just in their word processor. I also found this in their messenger program, email, and even in web browsers, free!

The other thing I hate about Windows is "You must activate your copy, and only one copy per computer".
With linux, there is no activating, or "one per computer". You don't have to fear changing hardware and having to call in to reactivate, typing in a ton of numbers and answering questions. You can give someone a copy of linux, and they can try it, for free, and for life! It's not 30 days free, or free for only a few people, it's free for everyone for life!

As for one who mentioned that Linux releases more fixes than Windows, that is true. The difference between Windows and Linux when it comes to releases is like this. When Microsoft finally gets the operating system done enough, they will release it.
Linux will release free their OS/software right away. You can download it right away as it becomes available or simply wait until they fix the bugs.
So in other words, let's say both OS's have the same software. Day 5 comes along, and this software pretty much works, but may have some bugs.
Linux will release this, and you have the "option" of installing it and trying it out, or wait until more bugs are fixed.
Windows will not release this until it is more offical and finished.
This is why linux has a lot of patches, they give it to you when they first get it going, and as they continue to improve this, you can enjoy it right away and not have to wait so long.

It is also true that Windows can be attacked by viruses within hours, where as linux can take several days/weeks/months.
Also, Linux has been proven to give your hardware/computer a longer life span.
It can also work better with older hardware so you don't have to be compelled to upgrade all the time.

Why not try out linux? It's a lot cheaper, and you may be amazed by how great it really is. I prefer Mandriva 2006. It's a great system.

Final note -

Windows: Very costly, even more so to get the benefits/features
Linux: Free

Windows: One per computer, or buy more licenses
Linux: One copy to everyone for life, or each person can have a copy for life

Windows: Boring; basic programs
Linux: Several programs, multiple browsers, more than one type of software to fit your needs.

Windows: New hardware/reformat PC: You must spend time on phone and answer questions and type in SEVERAL numbers to activate your PC.
Linux: New hardware/reformat: Here's your OS installed; you're good to go!

Windows: Constantly gets attacked by viruses
Linux: Quite a lot safer

Windows: Support? lol. Yeah, there may be some
Linux: Various sites where you can ask questions for free and get help on your OS

That's just some of the reasons why I love linux

The Mac OS, $129 list, often cheaper, doesn't get viruses, worms, malware, etc and probably runs all the software you do on a PC, with the exception of some games. Go to a Mac Store and try it for yourself

That, or purchase a new laptop, which was probably the point.

<review_text>
What a complete pain! ..... We now use Macs. However, I decided to take the California bar examination July 2006. The California bar examiners allow the use of laptops utilizing a software program written by Examsoft. Presently, the software will only work on Windows XP. Moreover, the California bar examiners will not allow any Macs, even the newer Macs with the Intel processors which require complete re-booting into Windows.

As a result, I was forced to upgrade my Gateway laptop, a fine laptop as far as PCs are concerned, in order to sit for this bar examination. (That, or purchase a new laptop, which was probably the point.) THANK GOD FOR GATEWAY COMPUTER TECHNICAL SUPPORT AS THE MICROSOFT FOLKS ARE CLUELESS:

Even though the warranty on my Gateway laptop expired some time ago, Gateway has walked me through more issues during the installation process than I can possibly discuss here. Conversely, Microsoft simply bounces me around from one tech support person to the next until the telephone becomes disconnected. .....

I suspect that the marketing strategy is that new software (any new software) will only work with the newer versions of Windows XP or Vista, and since Vista will be such a memory hog, consumers eventually will be forced to dump their PCs which cannot be upgraded, for new PCs.

As for how the operating system actually works: a grade of Fair. YESTERDAY, THE MICROSOFT UPDATE WEBSITE WAS DOWN WHICH, ACCORDING TO MICROSOFT'S DISCUSSION WEBSITE SEEMED TO BE A PROBLEM WITH OTHER WINDOW USERS AS WELL. Typical

I received the package and read the instructions.  In retrospect there were hints buried there that indicated this may not go well.  It did not.  My installation stalled out and would not complete rendering the computer useless.  I had to take it to a professional to get it going.  Even so, I have had problems with Internet Explorer stopping suddenly, BSOD's.  This is not a job for the average computer user

It is now almost a month since I bought the upgrade to XP Prof. for my destop computer running W2K Prof. I have had nothing but trouble. My notebook computer, connected by a wireless next for almost 18 months, suddenly could not connect to the desktop. All network setup and trouble-shooting help did nothing. I called MS and things got worse. Now I have an dditional problem (no sound on my desktop) and the first problem remains unsolved. I have been through three layers of MS technicians, only the last of which spoke English with an accent close enough to mine to be understood. Nonce could fix the problems and they are now "researching" the problem and supposed to call me this morning. During one of the calls, the tech. tried to blame it on my notebook. If any of you are old enough to remember when there was only one telephone company, you'll ercognize the situation. Right now, I would prefer getting a refund and returning to W2K

First of all, Microsoft needs to come down on their prices (Not that this will ever happen). I build computers for a living, and I'd say that 9 times out of 10 Windows is the single most expensive piece of any PC I build. That being said, XP has come a long way. Service pack 2 has done wonders for security. I also found it is the most stable version of Windows I've used to date. That's not to say it doesn't have it's flaws. It still lets in it's share of "germs", stops responding from time to time (hangs), and it's very slow to shut down. The built-in CD writing software is TERRIBLE and Remote Desktop is not always a pleasure to use either. However, the biggest problem I've had so far is with product activation. As a PC technician, I'm always testing new parts. The most annoying problem I've had is that after you make a certain number of hardware changes (let's say you replace a video card, a hard drive and add some memory) all within a certain period of time (180 days maybe?) Windows makes you reactivate. This becomes a problem when you have to reactivate twice within this period of time. It makes you call Microsoft, where you have to convince the representitive that you're not trying to steal from them. Then you have to read them a long number (I think 41 digits) and then they'll read another long number back to you that you need to type in. It's driven me to the point of using Windows 2000 again to test my parts, even though this isn't always practical for testing XP compatibility. 
Overall, I feel that I paid too much for this operating system.

There are issues regarding hardware incompatibility w/ specific components of the Toshiba Satellite M45-S355. The hardware incompatibility issues w/ the DVD-RAM drive, the GL910 chipset, and the SoundMax integrated audio drivers are known to both Microsoft Technical Service personnel and their counterparts at Toshiba. I spent an hour of fruitless time on a conference call with technicians from both companies (both of whom spoke what could loosely be descibed as "English"). The Amazon representative with whom I spoke was in New Delhi. I ultimately figured out (on my own) which Toshiba drivers needed to be downloaded (again consuming hours of download time with a 56K modem), and I used an Iomega CD-Rom USB external drive to load the software after about six extremely aggravating hours. I was able to avoid similar pitfalls when attempting to install Small Business Accounting 2006. Don't buy these products unless you absolutely MUST. Microsoft's "technical service" is a euphemism more aptly meaning "technically useless". There is nothing technically professional about the additional capabilities of Microsoft XP Professional. I should also mention that both the Toshiba laptop and the software were purchased from Amazon

I assumed, incorrectly, that Adobe's customer service would be professional and quick. I have called three times in the past two weeks and have had to wait, at a minimum, 23 MINUTES just to speak to someone. 
When I finally got my product, they sent the Mac verion rather than the PC version I purchased. I called again and waited approximately 30 MINUTES to get customer help. I had originally ordered the PC Standard version and asked to upgrade (and pay difference) for the Professional version -- since I still hadn't received the PC version. Customer service stated that they would ONLY ship me the Standard version to replace the incorrectly shipped Mac Version and then I would have to wait for the Standard verison to arrive at which point I could call again, and ask to exchange for the Professional verion - INSANE!!!  Adobe's call center is easily the worst customer service I have dealt with -- and I've dealt with some bad customer service

I use PDFs a lot and I must say that quite often I turn to Free PDF software to actually do the tasks that Acrobat fails to do. One area I have always had a problem with is the formatting of some documents in size and sometimes Acrobat simply fails to recognize them and so I switch to the Free PDF software which has no problems doing this and is easier to use.
However if you are a pro PDF maker who wants to add sigs and links and notes and chapters and all the other function tags including security tags then I recommend this product hands down as the best one. I just find that it is not always the best PDF software package in the world, but a good one all the same.

I would not recommend buying this one just to make standard PDF files alone. If you want to touch up those file then this is what you need to do that right.

...for InDesign to not have one basic features. Everyone I know still does french folds, but in order to see double page spreads in InDesign you have to lay them out wrong in the program, then you have to painstakingly go through your document and shift the entire document by one page, layout by layout. This is mortally stupid. At this point Adobe should have figured how a tool like I.D. is actually used in conjunction with a printer, not just assumed the user wants to print what they see on their screen. The oversight is the difference between avergage klunky desktop publishing software and a great layout tool. Why isn't there a button that toggles me between the layout view and priont output? Why do I have to slave over a document like this? Adobe, stop thinking in the abstract and investigate how your software can facilitate printed results.

Also who knows how you get an alpha path or clipping path into this? Mine shows me a heavily pixelated, entirely xparent BW image when it supposed to be a cropped color image. What do you want me to do with that

I recently purchased the software above only to find it does not support my dvd drive  (HL-DT-ST RW/DVD GCC-4482B (1.00)I have unsuccessfully tried to contact roxio support three times.  No response.  I did go through the long list of supported drives and also emailed my problem to Roxio.  Needless to say, I am very disappointed and do not recommend the purchase of this software. 
I have a new Gateway desktop that came with the above drive.

I found this program simple, easy to operate. However, when creating a DVD project I used a narration for my audio.  The narration matched each picture perfectly, when I decided to burn it all of the audio was thrown off.  Do NOT count on any tech support.  They offer an online chat with tech support but do not respond or are not online at all.  You have the option of forking over $35 PER INCIDENT in order to get a real live person on the phone- but it still does not guarantee it will help.  And now, I'm not even able to burn it!!!! I hate this program

This Roxio software has caused me the most bizarre and frustrating experience ever.  First, it doesn't work.  Second, I cannot obtain any support from Roxio to find out why.  They won't give support until you register, the only way to register is to follow a web link that comes with the software, and it takes you to a website that either doesn't exist, or is always down.  Thus, it turns out to be a complete waste of money, not to mention several hours of time.  RUN, don't WALK away from this software and this company

Loaded it on my laptop. It says that a compatible device was not found.
Went to website, downloaded patch. It said I had the latest patch already.
Everywhere you go on the roxio website, it tells you you can upgrade to version 8 for $20 off. It still is more than $50 and if Version 6 doesn't work, why would I throw more money at the problem?

I could find no usefull information on the website and no way to speak to someone.

I took it back to Best Buy. They said they could only exchange it for the same piece of junk. I went next door to Staples and they said if I bought software that does not work from them, they would refund my money if I bought it back within 14 days. So, I found a new source for software.

Pros: 
It did not crash my laptop
It did not cause the modem to dial international calls

Cons:
Doesn't work
no tech support
doesn't work
no tech suppor

Acrobat 5 was so buggy that I thought I'd give Adobe a couple of product cycles before upgrading. Should have waited longer. There have been improvements in v7: a better look, better commenting, the ability to add text that actually prints, and far better OCR functionality. But other basic functions are way worse than in v5: some Word documents that were easy to convert to pdf in v5 will not convert in v7, seems to be something to do with font license issues. Installation is a nightmare and repeated re-installation was required to get past system hangs, clashes with standard security software, and endless errors in the automatic update feature. The new product activation makes this even more of a pain because too many re-installations force you to activate by phone. Despite my already low expectations of Adobe, this product is a disappointment. With Acrobat 7, Adobe is, as usual, charging top $ for what any decent company would consider an embarrassing mess even as a beta version. 
(For reference, my system is Window XP pro, Pentium 4 3GHz, 2.5GB RAM)

I am very disappointed with this product.  Using the features of it are very difficult (red eye, sizing, etc.) in addition, digital photos downloaded into Photo Album 6 are of poor quality/clarity on the computer screen. I expected more from it but have found I have less.  I will not buy an upgrade but rather will look for another product with similar and more easy use features

I used a bundled package in a new laptop to create a photo album. When trial time expired, I purchase the full package. I could not open the existing album with the new software. The new full package is hard to use and the so called 1000's of templates can not be found. USE SOMETHING ELSE!!!
I even e-mailed Corel about this. Its been 4 days, I have NOT had a response.
DO NOT BUY!!! I RATE THIS PRODUCE AS A -2 STARS

It's to bad I can't give negative stars as this package certainly deserves them. This program is total garbage. A gargantuan waste of both time and money. 

Seemingly with every menu change, it recatalogues your entire photo collection, on ALL DRIVES, which takes HOURS (like 12+) to accomplish. And, while it will scan and catalogue all of the drives on your computer, don't even think about selecting a folder and expecting it to display the contents of that folder and all of it's subfolders. Ain't a gonna happen... but is will happily go through and catalogue them again for you, but, of course, after waiting hours for the software to finish catalogueing, it doesn't display the contents.  No, that would be way to logical.

After realizing that my computer had slowed to a crawl, I checked the memory usage and found that the Corel Photo Album 6 Deluxe was using 6 to 7 times higher than any other program running, and that includes Norton Internet Security, a notorious memory hog! Guess we now know what the DELUXE part is!

As far as I am concerned, Corel Photo Album 6 Deluxe is neither intuitive nor is it the "Best of" anything. It is a creeping, bloated dinosaur and a total waste of your hard earned money.

I am extremelly disappointed with Roxio, the makers of CD Creators; especailly Easy CD Creator 5.   I purchased Easy CD Creator 5, sometime back from an affiliate of Amazon.com.  It was dispatched promptly and in very good condition.  I installed it on my computer running Windows 98.   After some initial problmes it was running fine.    

A few days back I installed Windows XP professional on my computer, and I got a message that the CD Creator was not compatible with this version of Windows.  It hinted to contact Roxio.  I tried contact Roxio with the help of the link, but found it impossible to send them my message.   They have an automated "Roxann" that is so difficult to understand.  Next they invite you to a "Webticket" and you are supposed to mention your problem on it.   But when you submit your query or complain, nothing happens.  The site just stares at you dumbly!! There is no way to obtain Roxio's mailing address either.  So now I am stuck with this "Easy CD Creator 5" with no help from Roxio?

The first version of Easy CD Creator I used was CD Creator 4 basic. It was okay, pretty much what it said it was: basic. I got the upgrade to that from an Ebay auction and it worked pretty good. Later due to lack of support by the manufacturer for new CDRW drives in good old version 4, I upgraded to CD Creator 5 Platinum (The version being sold here.) This too worked pretty good - for a little while. Then the operation was moved over from Adaptec to Roxio, and from that point onward, things have been more thorny than rosy.

Roxio will REQUIRE you to register the product in order to download the (ONE) utterly essential update to keep this thing running. Perhaps you don't mind that, but I feel it's a somewhat minor invasion of privacy. Plus you have to keep track  of your password to the website and if you change ISP's you will have to RE-REGISTER. A hassle to say the least. Also , since Roxio took the reins, there are no further updates being provided. Instead Roxio tries to "encourage" (read "browbeat") you into getting the software upgrade for even more money. This upgrade will NOT work on Win98SE, which I still use for various reasons. So IF I were to upgrade the software AGAIN, I would also have to spend the extra money for a new operating system with all the faults and foibles that can introduce with other apps that I need and still use. If you have money to burn along with all those shiny round coasters you are going to be making, I applaud you. I prefer to keep a little cash for retirement.     

It is difficult if not impossible to get support from any real carbon-based life form, and the website gives little or no support for some of the issues you may face, such as getting "Illegal Request" errors from Direct CD, or inability to format or erase CDRW's that was once possible in version 4. Also, any CDRW's created in version 4 MAY NOT be readable with the new software, or at the least there are some technical issues with this. At any rate, it is not neccessarily all that "EASY" unless you are fairly technically inclined and understand (or are willing to learn) some of the finer technical points in CD recording technology. I prefer not to be bothered with it, I just want to create some CDs.    

I now find that some functions do not work appropriately at all, especially Direct CD, a program that originally provided the ability to do "drag and drop" writing of files to a Read/Write CD. Now I find that Direct CD is non-functional, and the only CD's I can write are CDR's, and there are problems growing in that area as well. Speed of the CDRW or brand of the recording media does not seem to be the issue. The software simply refuses to work as it once did.

It shouldn't be called "EASY CD Creator". Perhaps "IRRITATING" CD Creator would be more appropriate. 

In Summary: This does not deserve stars. Perhaps a few "BLACK HOLES"? While I once would have given wholehearted supported this product, regrettably I cannot support it with the same enthusiasm now.

This program is average to below average in it's abilities.

That said, just hope you don't need any Roxio tech support.
Why? because Roxio's  support bites!

You CANNOT contact anyone online or by email for help;
whenever their dis-functional "web portal" [web-based support] system traps you in an endless loop. 

I needed an couple simples updates for a pc that is NOT ALLOWED on the internet.

It used to be you could download Roxio's PATCHES from any pc having internet access. 
Then burn patch[s] to a CD, or copy to floppy/jumpdrive.
Then "sneakernet" the patches to the pc needing them.

NO MORE.

What happened today was that their webpage was apparently trying to download/patch a roxio product directly on MY pc.
[EZCD5 doesn't exist on my pc].

Instead of simply letting me download it somewhere, like to my hard drive, vs patchging it directly from their webpage to my pc,
[which won't work in my case as I'm not using roxio, nor have it installed on my pc];
 apparently the morons that did the roxio webpage coding make the download/patch process STOP/END and proceed to send the customer back to Roxio's initial patch download page.

When you need a patch, all these endless loops and support games
are enough to get me looking for a different product/different company.

If you want to minimize human contact with customers, fine.
But let folks at least download the patches they need in order to keep their pc going.
Don't hand over your customer support system [almost] completely to a WEB SERVER. 
That ignorant arrangement works about as well as when companies try to save a few pennies and get rid of phone receptionists for customer service telephone calls.
Then they let customers wade through a 100 layer deep voicemail system to find the answer to a simple problem.

IT JUST DOESN'T WORK.

If a company won't provide access to PATCHES, 
even after I have logged into their website with username and password, [so they know is accessing their patches] 
AND they  don't offer any type of 
FTP site  as a download backup  option, then 
I sure as heck won't be buying anymore of their products.

I see why Roxio bought up CeQuadrat and other companies.
[Though I hate to see such quality companies be devoured like that]. 
When a competitor has a better product, why fight to improve your prodsuct's quality/features, when you can buy the other company out.
 
Thank goodness Nero is not under the Roxio umbrella.

Despite many attempts and a complete reinstall of Windows XP, my XP machine refused to load Easy CD Creator 5 Platinum, rendering the progam disc and all update discs useless.

Probably if you already had the program running in a 98 environment and then upgraded to XP you could keep it running with patches and updates.  So take statements by resellers that they provide update discs with a grain of salt.  If you cannot install the primary program, the update disc is of no use.

The program is a good one but you have to run it on a 98 machine.

The Easy Language 16 is only useful if you're already familiar with the language you wish to learn.  I've been studying French for months before buying this product and found it to be helpful when I'm getting rusty.  The only problem is that it's hard to make out what is being said because the sound is not clear.  The recorded speakers also don't bother to slow down to give you a chance to understand or repeat what is being said.  This is good cause it's like listening to an actual French speaker and not a robot, bad if you actually want to learn how to pronounce what is being said.  It will also go over basic French grammar but is totally useless if you don't already know basic French grammar.      

I also tried to use this to learn Japanese.  Unlike French, I'm not familiar with the Japanese language at all so trying to use this product to learn it became a nightmare.  If all you want to do is learn how to speak the language it does have a Romanized version of the words and phrases to make it easier to sound them out.  Unfortunately the basic Japanese grammar and Japanese alphabet are all written in Japanese.  For instance, in the grammar section it has the past, present and future "I am"  it's written in english then beside it it's written in Japanese.  You can't click them to have it sound out for you.  In the Japanese alphabet section all it has is the Japanese alphabet and you can click them to sound them out but you really have no clue what you are sounding out.  So it teaches you nothing about reading the language but the test they want you to take are purely in Japanese.  I do want to learn how to read, write and speak Japanese so none of this would be a problem if it actually taught you how to read, write, and speak Japanese!   So my guess would be that you really have to be familiar with Japanese (NOT the Romanized(Romanjj) version) already in order to use this product.  Because of my experiences with this product I would say get it only if you know the languages you're interested in and use it as a refresher and nothing more.  Since I am familiar with French this product was pretty helpful but if I used this as a starter for the language I probably would have quit.  I'm searching Amazon for better Japanese books. So if you want to actually learn a language look to the books with the language tapes and CD's

My boss asked me to get this, so that he check out the Latin portion of it.

What a waste!  The only Latin on this CD is *Latin* American Spanish.

The interface was underwhelming. I needed to guess at what did what, because the controls are mostly icons. What's worse, there is no  menu bar at the top to help take the guess work out of using the program. 

Apparently though, the manufacturer did throw in an extra *not* listed on the back.  If you are learning the differences between US and UK English, its there!

I gave this one star, only because I couldn't give it no stars

I found this title messing around adding things to my wish list.  I only read the blurb on Amazon enough to see Haitian Creaole listed as one of the languages.  Today updating my wish list I took extra time to find out why this was rated so low since nearly every thing on my list is 4 stars or more!  How unfortunate to find out that others before me made the mistake I almost made buying this in hopes of it having Haitian Creole!  Very disappointing!!!!  The makers should be ashamed

They have the hebrew backwards!! You are supposed to read hebrew right to left-the opposite of english and this cd has it left to right. I find it extremely confusing. I know how to read hebrew and I wanted to learn how to speak it.

I just bought and installed this CD with the hopes of learning some Haitian Creole, and I, too, couldn't find it.  There is absolutely nothing on the installation CD that mentions either Haiti or creole... except the jewel case which insists it's there.  I'm so dissapointed I haven't actually tested anything else out:  I consider this a VERY bad start

I just bought this cd because I am learning Haitian creole, and that's one of the languages that is supposed to be on this cd. When I installed it, I was unable to find anything on the CD in Haitian creole, even though it is listed as one of the languages on the case. So it has been a complete waste of money for me, perhaps if I was interested in the other languages I could give it more stars.
It also says in the blurb that u can use any of the 16 languages as the source language, but that is not possible either, u can only chooose a few of the languages as your source. I am very disappointed in the false advertising for this product. If anyone can find creole on this cd I would be happy to stand corrected.
PS I contacted IMSI and they say the cd's were mislabelled, there is no haitian creole on the cd, despite the fact that it is listed on the cover

Acrobat 5 was so buggy that I thought I'd give Adobe a couple of product cycles before upgrading. Should have waited longer. There have been improvements in v7: a better look, better commenting, the ability to add text that actually prints, and far better OCR functionality. But other basic functions are way worse than in v5: some Word documents that were easy to convert to pdf in v5 will not convert in v7, seems to be something to do with font license issues. Installation is a nightmare and repeated re-installation was required to get past system hangs, clashes with standard security software, and endless errors in the automatic update feature. The new product activation makes this even more of a pain because too many re-installations force you to activate by phone. Despite my already low expectations of Adobe, this product is a disappointment. With Acrobat 7, Adobe is, as usual, charging top $ for what any decent company would consider an embarrassing mess even as a beta version. 
(For reference, my system is Window XP pro, Pentium 4 3GHz, 2.5GB RAM)

If I had $1 for every time a CS2 app crashed and made expend real hours to redo work, I'd have about $10. And that's enough for me to say, BEWARE of this set of applications! Adobe has allowed them to get too bloated, too slow, and the results are that all the programs (but principally GoLive, InDesign and Illustrator, in that order) are crashy and will quite suddenly, forcing you to expend the precious hours of your life redoing work you just finished. I cannot stress how disappointed I am in Adobe, and how distraught I am that we as a nation have allowed the only two competing companies to join, thus guaranteeing that there will be less quality and innovation in the future. In any event, do not buy the CS2 apps, Adobe does not deserve your support

Yeah, I know it's the industry standard, and it's powerful, and all that stuff.  But, MY GOD, what a freaking PAIN to use.  It's just plain tedious to draw anything from scratch.  While the interface in CS2 is an improvement, doing relatively simple drawings with primitive shapes and freehand curves still requires much more effort than it reasonably should.  Frankly, I could draw better stuff faster with 1990's-era Macintosh drawing programs.  The drawing issues are compounded by the fact that -- in true Adobe spirit -- this program is incredibly bloated and slow.  It's slow doing EVERYTHING... I've never seen a program so slow starting up.  And every time you save a file (even a tiny drawing with 10 shapes) you get a "saving file" progress bar for a few seconds.  It's also incredibly slow to shut down... frequently taking about 30 seconds.  I'm running it on a Pentium M laptop, and I know this is not a "graphics professional" machine, but COME ON!  Let's get the lead out!  I just get the sense that Adobe pays no attention whatsoever to efficiency or speed.  That bugs me a lot

Microsoft Office can be handy to have.  The files you can open, edit and create with it (most notably .doc, .xls, and .ppt) are probably the closest to universal compatibility among all your high quality options. It's (relatively) intuitive.  It has a pretty broad array of useful functions.

It's also obscenely expensive, considering the fact that you can get all of these things -- .doc, .xls, and .ppt; intuitive interface; and functionality -- for free.

I hunted up OpenOffice two years ago when I decided several hundred dollars was an insane price to pay for the ability to write papers, make basic presentations, or put together spreadsheets.  I was looking for basic functionality, but I was pleasantly surprised; OpenOffice does most of the neat tricks, too.  (Actually, it has a neat trick Microsoft can never replicate: it's open source, so it can respond to the needs of individual users.  You just say "Add this neat trick!"  and someone will likely be able to do it for you.)

It is possible that Microsoft Office has some killer feature you absolutely must have that OpenOffice doesn't.  But considering the price differential, I wouldn't splurge on this before checking.

Office 97 was a pretty good product. The programs were powerful, had a decent interface (maybe not as good as the Claris products of the early 1990s, but not bad), and came with a ton of features all on one disc. The Office 98 release for Mac was pretty much the same thing. The only thing that really got annoying for me was the office assistant (paperclip) but it is easy enough to turn off.

Office 2000 was a bit of a disappointment for me. I felt that the improvements were minimal (aside from a bit more stability in Word--anyone who has ever used Word 97 on a regular basis knows it's prone to crashing) and in fact detracted from the ease of use. One example is the clip gallery, which went from being one of the best organizers ever created to becoming a program that wouldn't have received decent reviews in 1988. Another is PowerPoint's outline feature. I always turned this off because it ate up monitor space and therefore made the actual slide smaller. When you use smaller displays like I often do this is a problem. The menus, which hide some functions until you go to the bottom of them, were also an annoyance. The manual went from being a nice thick book to one half the size.

Office 2003 continues making the program uglier. Now there are many tasks crammed onto one little panel on the right of the screen. Again, this eats into the workspace. The clip art system is even more cumbersome, and many of the clips are online only now. The help feature tries to point too much in the online direction as well. Now some people may not complain, but what if you're using a laptop in the middle of the country?

I feel that the program is basically an uglier version of the same thing that was first seen in 1997. In fact, the 1997 version was more pleasant to work with and almost as powerful. On my Macs, I've switched to Keynote for presentations and Pages for some of my word processing because the new Office versions on that platform are similar.

Some of the templates also look very 1997. Apple's programs are updated on a regular basis, and their templates look very modern. Now I know Microsoft adds some new ones now and then, but they should consider redesigning many of them--such as replacing the overused Arial and Times New Roman fonts with something a little more classy.

The program is bloated way too heavily. I can run Office 2000 comfortably on a 486 with sub-1GB hard drive, but can't even get 2003 on it.

A final gripe is that Access is not user friendly at all. File Maker is a better alternative, as it is easier to use and friendlier

Ok! Being the richest human being on the planet called earth, Bill Gates decided that he's not wealthy enough. So he released this Microsoft office 2003, which I really think is not much different from previous edition. The price is, as usual, very expensive. What's worse is that Bill Gates decided all the pre-installed windows in new laptops and desktops come with the trial version. So mere mortals like us need to spend extra BIG money buying the full version to simply do some basic documents.
I can see Bill Gates, being a deified bloodsucker, using $100 dollar bills as toilet paper, and laughing at us who work their butt off just to make enough money to live. SO SHAME ON YOU BILL GATES AND MICROSOFT

Microsoft is simply sloppy with their programming!

"Open Office" is a better program, is open-source (meaning if you don't want some paperclip's help, you simply don't download that part of it) AND OPEN OFFICE is FREE! It is also compatible with most of the functions that MS Office uses (and is upgraded with new features faster than MS's product, which is a rip-off!)

MS's Office 97 was the best of the Office suites, even though it did have it's problems, Spending the money to supposedly "upgrade" to this (or any other Microsoft product for that matter) is simply burning your money!) 

OPen-source software is FREE, it's perfectly legal, it is open t anyone decompiling it, so if you want to make your own custom goodies, you can, but then there are so many written by so many people willing to share, you don't have to develop your own, as there are already *SO* many freebie ones (and some low-cost additions by some places, but most are free) that if you want whistles and bells, or even a Christmas theme in February, you can get it for OPEN OFFICE! (Not so with this or ANY Microsoft product for that matter)

Simply sloppy programming - nothing more, AND you can get a fully functioning and compatable office suite for free legally

While Microsoft tries very hard to make Office "think ahead of me," they almost always seem to get it wrong.  The result is a package that consistently annoys me.  It is true that one can turn off the "helpful" hints and otherwise customize the programs so that they are less hindering, however the bloated package will nevertheless usurp your computers resources like nobody's business.  In my opinion, Office '97 was an excellent package, and the versions since then have gone steadily downhill.  As with many people, I use Office at work because I have no choice.  At home I've had good luck with StarOffice from Sun.  While not perfect, StarOffice has read and created files compatible with Microsoft Office very consistently in my experience, and it's a whole lot less expensive.  I am therefore hesitant to recommend Microsoft Office Professional Edtition 2003 to anyone except those who need the most advanced functions of Excel and/or need to use Access database frequently.

I bought this upgrade because I thought it would let me share my contacts. It says so on the box, but it doesn't. It works just like the old contacts which you can't share with others except if you export it. No live sharing. Why couldn't they make it so I could put the file on my server? Or on a secure site? Then all my office can work off one contact list.

50% or more of the time the business contacts can't be found when you search for a contact. It's like the business contacts is an add in that doesn't work with Outlook. Or you add contacts, save it, email to the saved email address and then go to find the contact later and it is gone. 

Also, lots of times when you try to SEND, the email won't SEND, it stays in the outbox. And repeatedly you open and hit the SEND button but it won't change to SEND status. Now, if you leave it in the outbox, sometimes that fools the program into letting you send other email. Or sometimes you can FORWARD and SEND.. Geez, what a waste of money this upgrade was. We won't be using it on any of our other computers and we haven't bought if on the new computers we have ordered.

Before you donate your hard-earned money yet again to Bill Gates' 'Feed the Multi-Billionaire Fund', do yourself and the world a favor and search for 'Star Office 8' on Amazon and read the reviews there. I use MS Office Professional 2003 in the office, and just cannot believe how badly so many businesses and individuals are being ripped off by Microsoft for this BLOAT-ware. 

Star Office 8 is under $50 from Amazon and is fully compatible with Microsoft Office, and includes full functionalities of MS Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Visio, and Access. Let me know what MS software I can buy under $100, let alone $50. Hopefully, this is the beginning of the end of the Microsoft Monopoly, and the dawning of the Era of Sanity in computer software.

I've worked with Pinnacle Studio versions 8.0, 9.0, 9.4., 10.0, and this one.  And they've all had two things in common:

1.  When the program works, it's superb.

2.  The other 50% of the time, it crashes frequently, and hard.

For years, Pinnacle had designed the market's top, novice-affordable video editing/authoring platforms, but for some frustrating reason, they just can't seem to keep the bugs out.  Studio Plus v10.5 is no exception.

Lately, the competition in this market has mushroomed, and there are better alternatives available for the same price.  At last, others have emulated the Pinnacle platform while eliminating the work/creativity-killing bugs.

My advice?  Shop around.  Google the competition.  But save yourself the frustration and steer away from anything Pinnacle

I used Version 8 and 9 and NEVER experienced a problem.  Version 10.latest version is terrible.  Crash and burn.  Don't take their advice and re-install your operating system.  Its THEIR software and not the OS.  Amazon and Pinnacle (Avid) continue to sell this product even though its terrible.  I read it was re-written for version 10 and they CAN'T get it right.  Nonetheless, they still charge full price and for support calls. The upgrade should have been free.

There are several good products now so Pinnacle isn't your only choice.  I changed to Sony Vegas and am very happy but it does a have a learning curve.  For super simple try Ulead or one of the others.

Pinnacle Studio can assist the amateur videographer in ... 

Hold on ... let me start again.

Pinnacle Studio can assist the amateur videographer in editing some fairly interesting ... 

Dang it! Give me a few minutes here ... 

Pinnacle Studio can assist ... 

(Samuel L Jackson-styled expletive) ... how many times is this gonna happen? Start and stop! Start and stop! Enough already!

One more time. Now, what was I saying? 

Oh, yeah ... Pinnacle Studio can assist the amateur videographer in editing some fairly interesting video ... if you can keep it up and running.

Got the idea?

Just adding my voice to the chorus of those have experienced the frustration of the Pinnacle products. This is a bargain-priced product for which you will pay the cost of long hours of irritation and heart-pounding races to meet project deadlines -despite the software malfunctions. 

After installing the program, installing the patches, uninstalling the program and patches and reinstalling the program and the patches, I am still experiencing too many crashes.

If you intend to use this program to piece together a video of Uncle Morty's birthday party, the family vacation or your neighbor's kid's bar mitzvah, the cost and the ease of this program may outweigh the annoyance of its aforementioned weakness. If, however, your video projects fit under the category of "job description," then I suggest spending the money for Adobe Premiere

Let me sum up this software "total junk"

Pinnacle will give you one free support phone call for help, then $25 for the next call.

They give you free email support, but answer everything but your problem.   They try and blame it on Windows XP, and will have you reload Windows.

I owned Studio 8, and it worked fine.   Went to Studio 9, and had a few problems.   Upgraded to Studio 9 Plus, and after a week of trying to make it render my projects with no sucess, and crash after crash, I removed it from my machine.

They sent me an offer of their all new 10.5 plus upgrade, Hollywood FX, 3 of their Premium packs, and a hat that says Studio 10 on it.   This said that the program had been rebuilt from bottom up.    This program should be called "Crash after Crash", and the only thing that works is the hat.

If you feel the urge to waste $100, and hours of your time, just buy this product.

Look at the reviews on Studio 10, and the other Studio products, and most only have one star.   Out of over 100 reviews over 95% had one star.   I found one with 5 stars, but looking at the reviewers other reviews he is obviously an employee, or share holder in the company.   He wrote a 1 star review on a Sony competative product, and 5 star reviews for other Pinnacle products that you would not own if 10.5 worked

I've been a user of Pinnacle version 8 (which I loved), and needed to update to a version that could burn dual layer DVDs.  What a disappointment this "upgrade" has been.  Crash after crash.  What is most disappointing is that Pinnacle built in a feed back system so the users could "help" them develop a better product.  This means to me that they knowingly released bad code, and used their customers as guinny pigs while sticking us for a $100.  Guess what, I don't want to help Pinnacle build a better product.  I want a product that works when I purchase it.

Lesson learned.  Next time I read a bad review on a product, I'm staying away

I was very disappointed with this program. But I was also thinking it would be more comprehensive and include more than just basic words and phrases. Even so, the male and female guides in the program often pronounce the words slightly different which can be frustrating. I learned more Icelandic (along with correct pronounciations) while in Iceland than I did with this program. And besides, anyone under the age of 50 in Iceland speaks English

I have owned eleven VCOM products and from now on, they don't have my business. The product touts itself in part as a vital tool when/if your machine crashes. If it does, be prepared to shell out the cost for another complete program. You are told that the program is already installed on another machine and you can't run it-although this occurs after a lengthy and cumbersome installation process. Sadly, customer assistance is no help-emails are unanswered and you can't get through via phone...What you do get from them once you register are constant emails about new products. Thanks, folks. Version 6.0 is also much slower than Version 5. Support for 5.0, by the way stopped abruptly when the new edition came out, despite the functionality of that program.   For the price, the software should work like a major player, rather than a dollar bin special.

An Internet search found complaints about not receiving rebates.  Why would they give you something for nothing?  

I have had several rebate problems and most of them involved free items or insanely cheap items.  

This "free" software could cost you $30 if the company decides they don't want to pay

Be advised, this Software is for a SINGLE USER, only licensed for one computer. I bought this for Home use after using SS% for 2 years and V-Com said it would no longer be supported of 03/06. I installed it on 2 home computers, it worked fine for 4 weeks, then it popped up a Box on my second computer that I couls not use it because it was licensed on another computer, I needed to buy additional license for each computer. When I tried to use it on my Main computer, it popped up the same message. So now it will not work on either computer. I uninstalled it and sent it back. Just because it's Cheap does not mean it's any good

I was using VCOM SystemSuite Pro 6 and it was working to my satisfaction.  But, after I reconfigured my PC to "Standard PC", the software rejected my Serial Number, claiming I was using the software on another PC.  I only own ONE pc.  Technical help claimed the serial number has been used on 6 pc's.  Well, that is totally incorrect because, like I said, I only have one pc and the software cd has never left my house.  They have a Bug in their serial number checking process.  Anyway, they would not help me restore the software serial number because I could not furnish proof of purchase.  They think I am a crook. I'm not, I only want what I paid for to work

  After purchasing the program thinking it would perform a through check on my Presario running XP Home all I get is a message that SSP6 has unexpectedly quite. I emailed tech support w/ the info, but so far no response after 10 days. There is no # to call for support. Maybe I overlooked something. 
  Also, I submitted the rebate form which came on the package, but was told that the seller was not participating in the rebate program and I need to check w/ them. I did and they said they shipped what VCOM had provided them, which included a rebate form if doing a competitive upgrade.
  Not very impressed w/ either the software or the company. Would never buy another product from these guys, even when the price after rebate is 0. LOF

I agree with others who said it crashes the system. Overall, I found SS6 Pro had more problems than it was worth--even if it were free, it's not worth all the time and effort. Besides all the crashes, downloading the virus/spyware updates via dialup TAKES FOREVER! Each download runs 1 to 1 1/2 hours. BE FOREWARNED.

In the end, I returned my copy to VCom, though to date I have not yet received a refund

I don't have a problem with the software.  It pretty much does what we need but reversing an error can be a nightmare.  Before I start this tirade, I should point out that the customer service reps were very nice.  But they don't have the infrastructure to provide the most basic level of service (please, read on).  The customer support system for the payroll upgrade on this product is really scary.  (1) They want to have access to your checking account to pay for the annual payroll subscription!!  (2) They DO NOT SEND RECEIPTS!!  I help with the books for a small non-profit and paid for the payroll subscription on my own credit card.  The only receipt I could get was a copy of the invoice, which is not formatted to print correctly on an HP1200 (duh!!).  What is really disturbing is that these people are supposed to be accounting experts!  If you acquiesce to the checking account withdrawal, the only receipt you receive is the line item on your bank statement.  Have they every heard of a "paper trail".  Well you sure won't get one if you purchase the payroll subscription for this product.  I will start looking for an alternative to Intuit because they obviously don't understand some basic accounting and auditing principles.

I was thoroughly disappointed.  The first few words I looked up in the thesaurus were not listed -- words like upholstery!  When I went online to see what I might be able to glean from their online site, first Fogware had not sent me a coupon, then I had to deal with bad customer service (I am not doing business with any companies anymore that give bad support) then after I finally got the coupon code they had left out of my box, the online info is exactly what we have in the cd -- so save your money and do not subscribe to their extended services site unless you need a spanish online dictionary also!  VERY BAD!  I am now going to go buy Roget's and check it out

Although this dictionary's contents are extensive, the screen functions are relics from the DOS era.  They are laborious and clumsy.  To find a word for difinition, it has to be spelled perfectly, there's no list of proximations to the word entered.  Changing a word selection is also clumsy especially in the thesaurus when the cursor doesn't show up in the entry slot. If someone knows of a better software, I'd sure like to hear cause this thing sucks!!  Maria McGowan

This product could put user/customer's life at risk. The mapping software navigates user turning into a one way street and takes you to a very remote off-road. This is the worst product that I have used in my life.

The only redeeming quality about this GPS system is that it's cheap.  I used it on a 1,000 mile trip on the east coast the week after I got it.  The navigation is poor. I found that I often had to look over to the laptop screen because I was "off route" so often due to the poor maps. The system repeated the same annoying problems that I see in other feedback.

1) The unit would show me being off the road even though I was on an Interstate. In this case it would continually recalculate the route and diretc me to take exits to get off the highway and circle around. 

2) It directed me to make turns onto one-way streets in the wrong direction.  

3) It could not locate a POI that turned out to be a few hundred yards away  

4) It often did not know the correct side of the road for my destination  

5) It doesn't provide a chime when it's time for a turn.  It will tell you the turn is a half-mile ahead, but that might be the last time you hear an instruction.

6) In one case, it got me to my destination (at least close enough) but couldn't guide me back to my starting point.

The GPS receiver seemed to acquire and hold the satellite signal well. But the maps are poor, as is the verbal instruction - it sounds like a 1980's computer generated voice.

If you're looking for a trustworthy guide in unfamiliar areas - this ISN'T it.

This is going back asap.

I rarely write reviews but I decided to write this since I had this urge to let everyone know that this product is just plain bad.  The review by "Reviewer: RC Lansing Mich" has listed all of my frustrations and I will not go over them again.  But the rating of 4 stars that he has given does not agree with what you will read in his review.  

The summary of this product is that it is "highly unusable".  You will be tired of using this on your first trip that you will not feel like every using it again.  Yes, you can "manage" you way with this product.  However it is not worth your time and money.

And last point that struck a nerve with me about the ols maps database ... the company came out with a plan where customers can send them updated maps, based on locations they have travelled, not covered by the original map database ... come on!

I have used MS streets and trips 2005 and 2006 for over a year. It has some map errors that I wish were updated. I read that The Delorme Street Atlas was far superior, so I bought it. It only took one day for me to find a mountain of problems. Not only is the mapping way out of date (Many years) Microsoft Streets and trips 2006 Maps are far more up to date. On many occasions told me to turn the wrong direction on roads even when the road doesn't exist in that direction. It doesn't even know the name of some very old roads Displays..."Unknown Name" While driving on very old established roads it tells me to turn onto a road that is actually an elevated overpass that I am driving 30 feet below. The program actually wanted me to get back on the freeway by making a U-turn from an off ramp to an on ramp. I have used Microsoft streets in all of these same areas and it is much more usable. The Delorme is very confusing and frustrating. I'm sending it back for a full refund

There's a reason why this stuff is significantly discounted. This is definitely one of the worst products I have ever bought. I did not do much research. I think the data may be in there, but I could not learn how to make it work. The interface is horrific - unusable. Don't do it

The description of this product on the Amazon site does not match what I received. Like another reviewer mentioned, the product was actually shipped from the UK so it took longer, and several features listed as being in the product are not there, specifically, exporting/saving of loops is not allowed, and there is no library of 1000+ loops included either. It seems to me to be basically like a demo version. Also, even though it was advertised as being new in the box, all I got was what looks like a (used) CD with no manual or CD key - so much for upgrading later! I am returning it. The SKU should be removed from amazon or the description should be changed to fit what is actually being sent out

I received this item today and was surprised
1) It was shipped from overseas (UK)
2) It came with only one CD instead of two like a previous reviewer thought
3) No paperwork - it came in a clear case with no artwork, info, etc
4) Sonic Foundry sold ACID to Sony in 2003 (according to Sonic Foundry's website) and SF no longer provides support
5) I can't get this to register online, which seems a little dodgy, but other than that, it seems functional. No huge library of loops, either. Can't really say I got what I expected

In installed this product on a Dell Optiplex GX110 (admittedly not the latest, but still a very standard machine) running Windows 2000 with 512MB of memory. In spite of spending literally hours with the software I was unable to get it to produce an outline or dimensioning of a wall being drawn by dragging the mouse, as clearly illustrated in the accompanying video. Without this feature it is virtually impossible to efficienctly produce exterior or interior walls. Multiple emails to Broderbund have produced autoreplies suggesting that I refer to their Website for help. This site is essentially worthless for all but the most fundamental problems (like not being able to read the install CD).

It would also appear that this product is picky about the hardware it supports and also the version of driver. Be prepared for possible frustrations with this product, with little support from the manufacturer. I cannot report on other features of the software because I was never able to produce even the walls of a structure

3D Home Architect is a complete crock. I have attempted to use it many times. After hours of reading and playing with it I am still unable to perform the most simple task. I own V1.3 of this software and it outperforms the current version by light years. I also spent lots of time trading emails with Broderbund in an attempt to obtain either additional product support or a refund and I got nothing. So henceforth they will not see another dime of my hard earned $. Sorry

I trusted that this software would do what it claimed to do and was so let down by its lack of performance that I am dumbfounded and left speechless.  During backup process I selected about 15GB of info to backup, spanning 4 DVDs.  Everything looked fine, except for TWO (2) simple errors that I received, indicating that those related files may not have been copied/backed up properly.  I figured no big deal, 2 files/errors out 15GB, I could handle that.  Based upon the false pretenses that my critical info was backed up properly (simple pictures, videos, mp3 files and Financial Files to include previous years tax files), I then proceeded to slick my drive.  Remember, only 2 simple, benign and almost inconspicuous errors during the backup process.  Everything looked great.

During the restore process, I then received numerous errors, each of them requiring me to click 'Yes' when asked if I wanted to proceed.  I got tired of clicking Yes around the 100 or so mark and decided to click no.  When you click 'no', EVERYTHING is undone; there is no 'ignore all' function so I had to sit through every prompt and got tired of it and decided that proceeding with 1000 files and answering yes would involve too much pain for me.  I then selected a smaller group of files to have restored, only the 'My Documents' folder but ran into the same situation.  Eventually I ran a test on a small folder to have restored and still ran into the errors but pressed through.  Hardly any of the files were received error free and those that had issues were never restored.  My guess is approximately 2/3 or 3/4 of my files were not restored and of course none that really mattered made it.

I had the latest update applied to the program, so that should not be the cause.  I would have done better to slick my entire hard drive without going through the backup process as I would have been at nearly the same place but without experiencing all the headaches, frustrations and an investment of hours, no DAYS of my time.

The program has been recently purchased by Microsoft for inclusion in the Vista OS, I imagine.  It will do well as a Microsoft product, as it fails to deliver upon its promises

All I wanted was a way to identify some files, remember which ones so every time I wanted to backup, I would press "go" and the backup would start. AlohaBob was too "smart" for my use. First, it has this intelligent file finder that finds what is likely to be backed up.  I indicate that I want to select my own files (which it lets me think I can do). Then thinking it would bring me to browser window -- no, no, no...it still needs to waste time doing its indexing as if I had selected the "smart find". I then manually select my files (great!!). In trying to save the "template" of what files I wanted to backup, it requires that I make it a reoccurring backup with selected backup frequency (YUK!!). I want to back up when I get to it (about once a month, not when it wants to -- I am backing up to a DVD which I need to put in the drive).  OK, so now I am over that and the backup begins - GREAT!!!  Upon returning into the application a month later, I can not select my saved "template" to "run now", it will run when it is scheduled to run :(  So...I need to repeat the whole process just to get the same files as last time backed up.  I exchanged emails with the company and they understood but were not going to "add" the features I described.  Oh well - it looked like such a promising product.  Now I need to find another that satisfies my requirements

I really dislike this software.  I'm the type that likes to customize everything and this program just is not made that way.  First, when you initially select files and folders, your disk choices are "C:" or "ALL".  I have several disks and I want to pick and choose, but this program makes that really difficult.  Then you have to pick a destination where the files will be backed up.  Choose carefully, because you won't be allowed to change it later!  And if you want to do incremental backups, be sure to schedule it before you do the initial save, because you can't do it later.  Basically the entire job, future backups and all, must be defined completly at the beginning and can never be changed without completely starting over.

800,000 images without keywords - the only useful parts of this collection are the classic and traditional .tif's that you can take into illustrator and turn into vector.  The high res images aren't, the clipart is less than microsoft office online quality and I've gotten far more use out of a 50,000 image collection b/c they took the time to keyword and catagorize the collection.

If you like to look thru a book and put in one of the 32 disks and then find the image - then this collection is for you.  If you want to have any sort of search capabilites, look elsewhere

I'm holding on the phone right now trying to get support for this product.  There is no 800 number for tech-support, so it's a long distance call.  I have had the same issue for over a month and still have not been transferred to a tech support person.  They offer only email support, but don't write back.  If you call them on the phone they tell you a support person will call you, but it never happens

This game was a little too hard for my tastes. Despite the fact that I played at the junior level I managed to get killed shortly after starting out. I also had to restart the game to figure out what my room number was because once I left the room I couldn't find my way back (all the corridors look alike). So far I've fallen down an elevator shaft, gotten caught breaking and entering, been crushed by an elevator, frozen to death and been hit over the head...I've got to ask is this really appropriate for children

I just installed AutoRoute 2007. There is a feature in AutoRoute where you can display various places of interest on the map. In this version, for some installations you can not hide restaurants. This has been reported on the Microsoft UK AutoRoute community website. I loaded the program on a second computer with the same result. Both systems run Window XP Pro. This means for certain cities, like Paris, at certain magnifications, the map is completely cluttered with small green squares which indicate the location of a restaurant. MicroSoft only indicates that they will enter this bug into the work request for the next version of AutoRoute. They also say earlier versions were not affected. You may want to buy 2007 but check out your ability to show/hide all of the items of interest right away and be prepared to be dissappointed. I am going to try finding AutoRoute 2006 for sale

My desktop CD-ROM refused to recognize that the CD was in the tray. It did recognize other CDs. My desktop is a HP Pavilion 2000 with Windows XP HomeVersion. My laptop did accept the CD so I know that it is not the CD. I purchased the product for use on my desktop, not the laptop.
I would appreciate instructions on fixing the problem

I wanted a simple product with a good red eye removal tool.  This program does not do well with fixing red eye.  Software did not come with a manual. I am computer literate yet I found this software not easy to navigate. I found HP Essentials which is a free download from the HP website to be a better program.

I bought the software ( Digital Image Suite 2006 ) before I bought my camera - to be ready to process the pictures I was going to take.  
A BIG MISTAKE.

I bought a Canon 30D camera and record my images in RAW format (*.CR2).
UNFORTUNATELY, not all Canon .CR2 RAW files are the same.  So, even though the software says you can edit .CR2 RAW images, it depends on which camera made the image.

Here is complaint number two -
If you use Microsoft's Customer Service/Technical Support you will be routed to India - and they will just give you an answer that is vaguely related to your problem.

After emailing several times and getting nowhere you will find out that you can't write to their Washington state headquarters unless you have the name of someone in the address.

So, basically, Microsoft is the largest technical software company in the world with the worst customer service and no American technical support.

Now, for the final complaint.  There is no link or method to get updates or upgrades for this program!  So, if I want to use a Microsoft software package to edit my photo images then I will have to buy a new software package - isn't that wonderful.

When printing cards it leaves a large border around front of card graphics.  The cards do not print anything like they are shown on box display with front of card display taking up the whole card. When I contacted tech support I was advised that in order to correct this problem my printer must have a borderless printing option.  My printer does not & I have been using another major greeting card software for about a year and half and never had this problem with that program. There is nothing on the outside of box under the system requirements that states this.
On the outside of the box it says you can return for refund if not satified within 30 days and that the details are in the box.  There are not any details in the box and when I contacted the company I got run around in circles stating there were two companies involved with the software and was never given information on how it could be returned.  I am stuck with it

I tried unsuccessfully several times to install it.
I contact their alleged support. They sent me what they deemed a "fix". The fix was awful. It caused my computer to crash and Print Shop would never work.
Broderbund used to be a good company but I've had nothing but problems with their software of late.
They need to rethink their products, their support, and their company focus.
They are lousy at this point.
They obviously don't give a dang about quality, support, or their customers

On the front of the box it says it can be used for Professional photo editing and has 20,000 Professionally Designed Projects, when I received the box it had a disclaimer that the photos cannot be used for products for re-sale, I purchased this product to do a work at home video and spent all morning evaluating the different software's and now I find out it is totally worthless to me. I went to there website and it says allow 4-6 weeks for a refund! I am going to turn them into the FTC for false advertisement

I wanted to use this product to tape sporting events, as part of a promotions unit I belong to. I had used Videowave 7 which was OK and produced a more than adequate product, but would on occassion crash to the extent I would have to reload the software. I thought I would give PE 3.0 ago, since Adobe products generally have a good reputation. 

Well, it goes to show that you can't just rely on reputation. The program lets me down horribly when capturing the video from the camera. THe camera records DVD video (VOB files) straight to DVD. When I capture these files into the PE program, all moving images within the video become pixelated with lost resolution to the point of being useless. I have tried various other ways of capturing but always the same result. There is nothing to be done from that point...for me this program falls on the first hurdle!! It is unbelievable to me that a professionally released image processing algorithm could corrupt video so badly, and frustrating that I actually paid money for it...a first year undergraduate could have provided a better effort. 

I have subsequently gone through the motions to produce a video, and to be honest he layout of the settings, ease of applicaiton of various functions is quite good and better than Videowave 7 IMHO. I was able to produce quite nice edited products with intro, text and audio overlays very quickly. Still this isn't much use when the video itself had already been digitally butchered.

If you are videoing things that don't move you may well like this product. If you are videoing dynamic scenes, give it a miss. Big disappointment

If you own a newer DVD camcorder that is manufactured by Panasonic, Hitachi, and others that records your movies in a .vro format you can not use this product.  You will have to buy an additional program that will cost about $40 to convert the .vro format to a avi, wav, or mpeg format.  If you own a camcorder that records in .vro do some research before you waste $80 on this program

I really thought that office was better proir to the whole XP upgrade, but that I will leave to other discussions. 

This product is your standard Microsoft office products. I am fairly sure that most have experienced their products. There are no surprises and the added bells and whistles aren't worth the upgrade unless your are a VBA programmer. 

Now, having gone through all of this, I DO NOT rcommend that you purchase this product, but purchase the Student version. Same product - HUGELY different price.

Yes, I love Microsoft Office. It's incredibly user friendly, it has wonderful features, most of which I don't even know how to use, and it's spelling and grammar checking features are the best of it's kind. I've been fortunate enough to have been a student up to now in my life and therefore did not have to buy Microsoft for my personal use, the school would always buy one for me. And of course there are always illegitimate means... but I'm not advocating piracy here.

However, I would be the last person on earth to consider using Microsoft Office if I had to pay $350 for it. It's an insane price. consider the alternatives:

Open Office: Does everything MS Office does, some things even better. I love how you don't need to buy or install anything extra to type mathematical formulas in Open Office. The best thing about this, however, is that it's FREE!

Google Docs and Spreadsheets: This one is even better. Not only is it free like everything else from Google, you can COLLABORATE IN REAL TIME with  anybody else on the internet to write your word documents! Nothing beats that, it's just the most wonderful thing that Google has done

Before you donate your hard-earned money yet again to Bill Gates' 'Feed the Multi-Billionaire Fund', do yourself and the world a favor and search for 'Star Office 8' on Amazon and read the reviews there.  I use MS Office Professional 2003 in the office, and just cannot believe how badly so many businesses and individuals are being ripped off by Microsoft for this BLOAT-ware.  

Star Office 8 is under $50 from Amazon and is fully compatible with Microsoft Office, and includes full functionalities of MS Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Visio, and Access.  Let me know what MS software I can buy under $100, let alone $50.  Hopefully, this is the beginning of the end of the Microsoft Monopoly, and the dawning of the Era of Sanity in computer software

This year, instead of renewing my subscription to Norton system Works 2004, I thought would be a good idea to bring it up to date. I purchased Norton system Works 2007. The 2004 version worked fine for several years, while the 07 version could not be installed on my XP professional PC. The Norton "consumer firewall" worked perfectly. They make it very hard to get effective help (unless you want to pay them $9.95 per call). Several sessions on their complementary "live chat" system proved useless. In the end, efforts to resolve the problems simply wasted an otherwise perfectly good weekend. I returned the product to Norton for a refund. Their return procedures indicate that I will wait six weeks to get my money back. Just wonderful

NSW 2007 (or 2006) premiere is useless when it comes to VISTA...and considering it comes pre-packaged with EVERY PC known to man (desktop or laptop) this is unforgiveable.
Norton AV has an update but that is a far cry from the ~$100 price of SystemWorks that MUST be uninstalled according to MS VISTA.
MAYBE with the 2008 version
Truth be known, System works has saved my aZZ a number of time since the 2003 version but now it is useless

Systemworks continues to grow, taking ore hard drive space and messing with more stuff on your computer, and I'm likely to buy an alternative next time I update.  Note it stops working entirely if you install upgrades to your computer - a new hard drive, motherboard, or processor and Symantec requires you to spend a fortune on another copy.  I like the basic functions, but there's too much baggage to recommend this product anymore

This is a terrible suite.

Read the fine print very carefully:  It will not work on RAID configurations of any kind.  It will tell you that in the install (thanks a lot...kinda late?)

I found its support on recovery disc of USB hardware unstable.

This is a very unstable, even errant, set of programs.  It also tries to take over a lot of system elements

I've a Norton user for many years.  I 'upgraded?' from NAV 2005.  This product was a pain to install.  I had to uninstall Zone Alarm, which isn't noted anywhere.  I've never had to do that before.  The installation process required rebooting multiple times.  In the past it had been an easy process.  Not anymore!  I will not buy Norton in the future

While installing Norton Antivirus 2007 XP, a Norton message flashed that I must delete Webroot for MSN. I did it, and it resulted in crashing the session. 
Tried first the paying phone support and gave up after 2 hrs wait. Then ried the online chat. The wait went on for 9hrs, started #245 in the queue and by now in lline at #59 I realized this was not the Norton I'd used for so many years, I ordered Kapersky anti-virus.

I've had Norton Anti-virus since 2002 on my 2002 Dell machine which meets teh program requirements.    Its gotten so slow as to be really annoying to use.
It takes 30+ seconds to open a 2 page word document.  When Norton is updating the virus file, the machine slows to a crawl, instead of downloading quietly (and a bit slower) in the back ground

Its slowed the machine to such a great extent that we don't use sleep mode anymore because when the machine is woken up it can take 10 minutes on a DSL to update.

Its so slow that I am trying Kaspersky 6.0.  I don't know if thats better or worse, but since I don't go to "dangerous" sits or perfom lots of downloads its got to be better than teh current state.

The way I look at it - with Norton Anti-Virus my machine functions 100% of the time as if its being slowed by a virus.  Anything is bette

Used Norton antivirus the last 3 years. getting product in tax software promotions.  No problems until I installed 2007 6 days ago, when my system became really slow and then I was unable to access the internet.  Since their customer service phone number is not in the User Guide but buried in their website, I was thankful my husband's laptop was available. The first rep became exasperated when his scripted suggestions did not resolve my problem after 1.25 hours and tersely told me he was sending me an email file that would solve my problems.  I had identified it was the Worm Protection causing the problem so I turned that off, accessed the file and ran it.  My computer updated twice with no change - if the Worm Protection was on, I wasn't going to be able to access the internet.     

Worked up my patience and called that evening, only to hold for 48 minutes.  Finally got another native of India who spoke English worse than the first guy. At one point, we were waiting on a restart and I asked her a question about the computer being slower with the 2007 version and she responded, "OK, yes".  Long story short, I hung up an hour later with a link for an update to the 2007 product which I was assured would solve the problem and an email address for her manager. During these two calls, the software was uninstalled, reinstalled, and tested and I spent several hours using the online support.  I updated the product and it worked for a couple hours.  Then I was right back where I began, unable to access the internet unless I turned off the Worm Protection.

I started the day with 360 days remaining on my subscription but once I updated, the protection center now says my subscription is expired. When I check my Norton account online, it shows I have almost a year remaining before expiration and all their tips to update the proection center have pathetically failed.

Sent an email to the management address I was given, but of course, haven't heard anything.  I am uninstalling this product and will never use Norton again.

I tried to like this product.  As previous reviews have said it has significant design limitations.  If you only need a 2D floorplan there are better tools for the same money or less.  The object libraries that come with the tool - furniture, fabrics, etc. - are really lame.  This limits it's value as an interior design tool.  I did not attempt to return it so I cannot comment on their return policy

This is a good product, except it keeps shutting down when I have my outlook or when I have a web page open.   My main goal for an antivirus would be to run when I search the web or get in new emails!   What good is it if it shuts down when these are open!   It did find a trojan on my first scan.  This was one that Norton missed.  I will be getting NOD32 soon.  Sorry this product did not work for me! It was very easy to use

Feeling more than a bit fleeced by McAfee's overpriced "subscription" renewal every year, I decided to give Kaspersky a try.  Installation went smoothly and everything seemed fine for 2 or 3 weeks.  Then one day my computer would not boot---just stalled on a blank screen right after the Windows XP splash screen.  When trying to boot up in safe mode, a list of the drivers currently loading scrolled down the screen.  It stopped at a file called kl1.sys and hung there forever.  A little research at work showed that this was a Kaspersky file.  

It may be just a coincidence that my system suddenly went kaput shortly after installing the new antivirus program, but I doubt it.  Attempts to use a recovery disk failed.  A trip to the local computer shop revealed that the data on my hard drives (which were in the inscrutable RAID 0 format) could not be recovered (unless I wanted to ship them to a recovery shop, and nothing on them was worth that much).  So they're going to reinstall windows, I'll have to do reinstall a shipload of software when I finally get my computer back, and, yes, I'll lose all the data that was on there.  (Gee, good thing I backed up all the kids' photos---well, most of them.  Thanks, Kaspersky!)

Anyway, perhaps my attempts at recovering the OS caused the worst of this.   Whatever the case, I believe the boot failure was caused by either the Kaspersky file being corrupted or a virus.  Who knows.  Kaspersky is to blame in both scenarios.  I do know one thing: I am not going to tempt fate by loading this program on my computer again.

And Kaspersky has yet to respond to my e-mail.  I got an automated "we received your e-mail" response, but nothing more, even though they state that they usually respond within a day or two.  That was over a week ago.  If in fact their software is in no way responsible for my computer flaking out on me, then I still do not apologize for the one-star rating, given their horrible customer service.

If you decide I'm insane or that this was just a fluke, at least do yourself a favor and make a decent boot disk for yourself before installing this product.  That might mean the difference between losing data/spending $$$ and just being inconvenienced.  And don't expect much assistance from Kaspersky should things go wrong.

This software does not provide even the basic red eye fix.  It turns them a light shade of grey, maybe. It is horrible.  This to me renders it useless. 

It is for the most basic of users.  There are no real manual functions to speak of, and my free software does a better red eye and also lets me do red eye manually when they cannot detect it.  

It has some neat functions but since it could not provide the most common need correctly,I would say do not buy.  Seller was great, product is poor.

On install the 1st problem encountered was that it replaced  my pictures folder, with another containing only "sample picture", yep  it took out a folder on install with no request or user action to do so. Regardless of how it works as an image editor such behaviour precludes its further use. 

This program seems to be unsupported by MicroSoft, least their support site won't let you mail them on it,  so when it does hack up your file structure. SO program cost me $15 recovery effort on pictures, over $50. Just wonderful.

Caution: Giving this software to your enemies will gaurantee that they will become mortal enemies, if they are not so already. 1 star is overrating this "product". I am only writing this review to satify some sort of altruistic urge. This software isn't worth a second more of your time. Just click a link now. Good bye! You are still there? OK, read on. I write computer code (C++, Java, C#) for a living and I could not get this software to work correctly. Starting up the "main console" application (read: service) kept turning off the Firewall (service). I could turn on the Firewall - but only if the main service was off. Brilliant! Well done guys on this festering sore of a pile of software. Glad I got my $50 back with the rebates, they should have paid me at least $100 for the wasted time. I spent an hour with their help, chat (which was slow and ineffective) and another 30 minutes tweaking the registry, all to no avail, but lots of frustration. I'm looking for another Firewall/Virus solution now

The positive about PCcillin is that it seems to work okay.  It scans email and the firewall works okay.

The negatives:
- It supplies a lot of warning requests.  This would be good, but they aren't explained in an easily understood dialog so you end up answering yes to permission requests without always knowing if that's the best choice.
- Even though it supplies 3 license keys the program is a little buggy and sometimes loses the keys.  If it loses the keys it disables the ability to update or click the customer service live chat button.  The process of restoring the key on the computer isn't too hard, but requires a bit of assistance from customer support.
- Customer service is slow.  Sometimes I've been lucky and gotten into support chat right away, but sometimes I've had to wait 40 minutes or more.  The support personnel don't seemed to be trained technicians, but just phone support people reading through a manual with canned answers.  Getting to the right answer can take a long time and a lot of trial and error.

I have used PCcillin for about 2 years now.  The latest version definitely isn't as good as it's previous versions.  I wouldn't recommend this product

After using this product for Mac for over 10 years.  I'm done.  The price keeps going up, the "tax-help" within in the program keeps diminishing and the customer service is almost non-existent.  

The server meltdown this year was the last straw.  Their servers weren't too busy to let me pay to efile.  But, apparently they were "surprised" by the number of people that they allowed to pay for their service.  Baloney.  I'll use a pencil and paper next year before I give Intuit another $100.

This software now constantly tries to get you to upgrade to a "better" package - the schedule C for small business.  I used to like TurboTax, but it has really gotten to be a pain. 

And finally, I spent two days trying to e-file, always getting a Server busy message from Intuit.  This is AFTER they got my credit card number and $34. to file the fed and state tax returns.  So I had to hand assemble the return and make the trip to the Post Office.  Intuit lobbied the Gov to let them keep this big $$$ plum, and then screwed it up.  They had this same problem last year, and it is WORSE this year. Time to call all our representatives and get E-File FREE from the IRS.  It saves the IRS money, far more than it costs.  Why is Intuit allowed to suck this much more from us after making big profits on the package

I use turbotax every year and I would E-file also. It says I can E-file for $16.95 and it even says that's all it will cost on one of the last windows.  Then right before it is about to transmit it says $16.95 for federal plus $16.95 for state plus 2.5 percent what I owe to some "third party" company, thats $25 for each 1,000 you owe.  If I'm paying some third company to transmit my return than why am I paying turbotax to do it also?

So ok I'll print it out and send it in. It wants to print out every worksheet and statement for a total of 53 pages.  It no longer gives you the option to just print the pages you need.

I am now cornered into paying the extra $90 to efile or go through the torture of printing out 53 pages in which I need only 5 or 6.

Dirty trick.

It makes the total cost $130.  It would of been cheaper and more efficent going to a good accountant.

Other than that the program has worked even easier than ever before

After years of e-filing fees being included with the purchase price, it would have been more forthcoming for TurboTax to put a large sticker on the front of their box alerting buyers to the price that they will pay for e-filing each return.

I lost the value of my entire state return - and then some - through e-filing fees: $44.95 (plus tax) for the program, $16.95 (plus tax) for each return e-filed (I filed two) and a little bonus fee to the company that handles the [credit card] transaction (that fee is never quoted in the program and I will have to wait for my credit card statement to find out what that is).  In addition, anyone who chooses to have the fees deducted from his/her refund has to pay an additional $30.

The product does what it says.  But, for the cost, and less-than-honest way in which the change occured (it almost seemed deceitful - hence the single star rating), I would have preferred to have given my money to my friendly neighborhood accountant.

People expect change, even if they don't like it.  But, suprises that cost customers money are never welcome and drive customers away.  Surely the marketing/advertising gurus can think of a way to alert the customer of a significant change such as this and even put a "positive" spin on it.  "Filing fees only $16.95 [per return] - less than the cost of a tax professional . . ."

No more TurboTax for me

Turbo Tax is less than impressive in handling stock and option transactions. It seems to view short sales as errors, reporting that the date acquired is later than the date sold. It does not appear to have a provision for tagging a short sale. It does not appear to have a provision for properly dealing with dividends on stock held for more than 12 months, but covered by disqualifying call options. Its screens for schedule D and D1 are awkward - it would be much better to have one large table screen for all transactions, with tags to set short term and long term tax application, from which D and D1 could be formatted for filing.

I have used Turbo Tax for the past 3 years so this year like a drone I purchased it at Amazon. Great price by the way. Well I receive the product and try to load it and find out as of July '06 it isn't compatible with windows '98. Now I have to send it to Turbo Tax for a refund. Its great that they are doing that but they should have put something on the front of the box. After a 45 minute call to Turbo Tax they finally agreed to credit me the difference of $20 for the purchase of their online software. The online software was the same exact program I purchased from Amazon but they charge $20 more...go figure. It sounds fishy and deceitful to me. I will never buy their software again!

1) I didn't have any ESPP transactions for a few years. Tax year 2006 I had some, and that was when I realized that nowadays they force you to use TurboTax premier for ESPP calculations. The last time I had ESPP in 2000 or so, the deluxe version at that time could assist you to calcuate ESPP transactions with wizards. Now you can't with deluxe version.

2) For first-time married-filed-joinly couples, they have to do a lot of work trying to merge their filed-single returns from 2005. The deluxe version simply does not handle this at all. Even if it helps you transfer the 2005 returns, they don't merge the data properly. For instance, if both couple have short/long-term capital loss carryovers from 2005, the deluxe version does not do that for you. Same for state/local taxes paid/refunded. Worse, if even if you try to correct it, sometimes you can't. There is obvious bugs, and I have to choose override from the menu to directly update the forms.

3) Nitpick: when you choose to print out the every forms, by default they print out all those only for federal taxes. I have to go to the State tab and choose my state, go back to the print menu, to print state tax forms.

I am not sure it that may be because this year is the first year I use the Mac version of TurboTax (I use PC versions before). But I really do not have a good tax preparation experience this year. Next year I may consider to switch

The product performs inconsistently. It failed miserably when it tried OCR on a page printed in comic sans, for instance, mistaking a's for g's, and @'s for a's, etc.  In short it was worthless for scanning in something as simple as a list of names and email addresses.   

It's "OK" when doing some fonts. And generally manages to figure out where the images are.  The interface is supposed to be simple, but is counter-intuitive, and confusing to learn.

Scanners are "iffy" -- may work, may not, so make sure you test in the 30 day trial period.  

Support?  Forget unless you want to pay.  Not even a single support call is included in the package. 

I will NOT buy or upgrade with this company again unless they are willing to provide at least a minimum of a couple of support calls or emails. 

I've had almost all the versions before this, and to be honest like this one less than what was before. 

If you want to try it, buy from a source that will honor the 30-day money-back trial period. You may need it

I bought OmniPage 15 yesterday morning as a download, and have been trying to activate it ever since. After several calls to customer service, forty minutes on hold to speak with a tech rep (who emailed me two links that don't open), I'm no closer to being able to use this program. It seemed to work okay in the few intro uses allowed before you had to activate to continue, but even then it kept wanting to reload with every page I scanned in. 

The product might be a good one--I'm not a fair judge of that--if only you can get it to work. As others have pointed out, tech support is expensive. If my experience is any measure, it's also worthless. 

Customer service is unresponsive, unpleasant, and unprofessional. In one call to Customer Service, I was asked if I typed the letters in the serial number as capitals and the O's as zeroes. When assured that I had, several times, she replied, "Then I can't help you--call the tech department," and abruptly hung up. To add irritation to insult, in the forty minutes I was on hold with the tech department, I listened to repeated assurances that a "reepersentative" would be with me shortly.  

Not recommended.

Both versions of Scansoft cause my installer to have problems. Mainly it tries to re-install Softscan every time I start up Softscan. Also It has started to try and reinstall Softscan if I try to right click on a JPG. There is very little to no chance of getting any help from Scansoft (Nuance)to debug this problem. Save your money and buy some thing else

Omnipage is a buggy piece of software which is prone to throwing errors and mysterious crashes (often occuring at the end of a lengthy process).  Nuance provides no support and when you attempt to contact them they want $9.95 for an email question or $19.95 for a phone question.  You might expect this from an inexpensive piece of software but for the cost of Omnipage you would expect some support.  I recommend finding something more reliable from a company that provides some measure of support

The real headache began when I attempted to "activate" the program.  I spent hours trying to activate it, to no avail.  I got messages saying that the serial number was invalid and a host of other problems.  Now, I would just like to get my money back.  I have used ScanSoft's stuff in the past and have been pleased with it, but, for whatever reason, OmniPage 15 has become, for me, an expensive nightmare.  After having spent many hours trying to activate it, I still have not succeeded.  Their support leaves a lot to be desired.  For one thing, they keep "bankers hours" so don't expect to get any help on the weekend or after hours

I brought Microsoft Windows XP Home Ed.SP2, to use on my Mac BookPro as a guest O/S. The software works fine on my Mac BookPro, the only downside was as soon as it was installed I had to update the software with 98 Security updates. For the software to be new right out of the box, it took up a lot of space on my harddrive with the Security updates, and the updates on my Mac BookPro have only been 6, since the day I brought my computer, compare the difference in updates to see which software has a lot of problems.

Other than the substandard security; the endless hours you will spend trying to clean out spyware, protecting against viruses, etc.; and the fact that Microsoft has built in it's own spyware to notify them when you are connected to the internet, it's pretty good. It is a good evolution of their graphical interface and quite intuitive. 

If you are concerned about your ability or willingness to protect yourself against malicious attack from internet scumbags, buy a Mac. As you face the upgrade to MS Vista, you're going to need to upgrade your CPU, so you are essentially at a crossroads.

Good luck

My last Roxio product was "Easy CD Creator 5." When I switched to a Mac I naturally expected "Toast" to be the Mac version of this product. I am extremely disappointed to find that the crippled video editing features in my (many years old) version of CD Creator is miles ahead of what they include with the most current and up to date version of "Toast" which I unfortunately own. It allowed me to edit video clips, create several levels of customizable menus, customize the size of compression, and burn to a DVD which played on my standard DVD player. Toast can create one uncustomizable  menu level, has NO editing, and locks up every time you drag a file into it. They (in the product description) say it reads mpegs but it's more like it freezes every time it sees an mpeg. It doesn't even read every mpeg reliably. The only thing I can find that Roxio adds to Toast that isn't in my old version of CD Creator is more enhanced MP3 and music features (which isn't what I bought it for). I may have been better off using "Parallels" in combination with CD Creator. I am sorry but compared to Roxio's CD Creator (which is basically the same price), Toast seems to have been designed by total IDIOTS. And I always thought that Mac software was better for working with multimedia

While I am sure the product does what it offers, this is the second version of Elemeents that I have not been able to load on my computer.  That's where the fun begins - Adobe's support is dreadful.  Their website is unusuable - other than constantly trying to sell you additional products and services - and they have no human support on weekends

I bought Adobe Elements 5.0 because I thought it had more features than Microsoft Digital Image Suite, and it probably does. Getting the Adobe software to work is the trick. I even bought two books to help me learn how to use Adobe and I still can't get it to work right. I should have stuck with Microsoft, it is much easier to use.

TurboTax has what looks like it would be a geat feature -- the ability to import data from your financial institutions so that you don't have to enter all of your stock sales by hand.  

Some of the cost basis (how much I bought the shares for) was empty, so I had to go in and enter them manually.  No big deal, just took a few minutes.

However, when I went to e-file, the program had flagged these changes as "overrides" to computed values, and refused to let me e-file the return.  Equally bad is that if I just leave the fields empty -- as they came from Charles Schwab, then it looks like I got the stocks for free, and have a huge tax bill (that is incorrect). 

So, after many hours of trying to see if I could change the field so that it would not be flagged as an "override", I determined from other upset users of TurboTax in the forums on intuit.com that I was out of luck.  I'd have to print it out and mail it in.

As a special reward, TurboTax doesn't even tell you what attachments you need to include on the return that you are now forced to mail in.  The help screen says that what it prints out will tell you what to include in the return.  That's wrong.

So, the main reason I got TurboTax was to e-file.  Now, I get to print it out, find out all of the crap that I have to attach to the return, mail it in, then wait for weeks to months to get my return.

Thanks, Intuit!!!!

The saddest part is that H&R Block had sent me a free copy of TaxCut before I bought TurboTax.  I should have used that before I spent $30 on a piece of crap like TurboTax.  Won't do that again

We purchased this to make sure we didn't miss anything re: stock options.  The program kept including a ghost set of options of a different type, though they were not entered twice.  It took me quite sometime to get them deleted.  It also said we had to pay estimated tax next year-which isn't true since we overpaid (as we have always done).  Too many errors for a tax program

I bought the Mac version of TurboTax Premier, and I installed it on my Mac with OS 10.3.9. After doing my entire return, I clicked to e-file and received a message saying, "Could not load attribute," This error box gave me the options to continue (which just took me back to the e-file page, which led me to the same error message) or connect to Intuit online support. The Intuit support site said, "This error occurs when attempting to file electronically.  If you are connecting through a router, try bypassing the router and filing again.  If the error persists, it may be necessary to file by paper.  We are currently working to resolve this error. . . . To be notified as soon as we have an answer, click here to sign up."

I don't have the technical know-how to "bypass the router." I also figured that if Intuit hadn't solved the problem by March 26 (the day I was ready to submit my return), they probably weren't going to, even if I were willing to hold onto my return until I'd received word they'd solved the problem. So I ended up mailing in my return. If I'd known up front that I wouldn't be able to e-file, I probably wouldn't bought the program.

Isn't this a Mac product? I thought Mac products were supposed to be (A) stable, and (B) easy to use.  This product is stable, (once I upped my RAM to 2GB) but at 512MB it brought the system to a crawl. 

But as far as ease of use--I'm not a dumb guy (although my kids may argue the point) but this product is really a victum of itself. It is too hard for the "Express" audience and is really intended (in my opinion) ONLY for profression Final Cut Pro users.  In other words, if you use Final Cut Pro at work, and want something on your home-Mac, the Express version is a great value. You already know it and people have paid you to get used to it.

But if you're a iMovie user, Pinnacle Systems Studio user, Adobe Premiere Elements 2.0 user, this product seems like I'm trying to fly the Space Shuttle.

How do you output WMV with this product? You can do it in any of the PC-based products, oh, and they also output Quicktime so why does Apple have a hangup about WMV?

I recently asked in an Apple forum "How do you do Picture in picutre?"  I got a great response from an experienced user.  "It only took a couple of minutes, just do these 6 steps..."   Great, in Premiere Elements or Pinnacle, I click on the PIP icon and its done.  I didn't have to do 6 obscure steps.

The product is also one of those old fashion "Million Windows all over the place" applications. You try to minimize the thing by pressing one of the tiny little minimize buttons (like all Mac apps have) and it closes only that window of the app, like the preview window, not the timeline, not the browser.

Bottom line... if you already use, know and love Final Cut Pro, this is a low-cost way to get a similar product on your own PC (although the Academic version of the Pro version is pretty affordable too).

This is among the most disappointing Symantec products!!!  When one tries to log in to the infovault, the login box is often empty! There is no way to submit the information.  It is also impossible to get a straight answer from Customer Service. BRING BACK THE OLD PRODUCT, PLEASE!!!!  Have been a Norton customer for years....this one is just not great!!

Norton old password manager worked much better.  It is a pain to use especially if you use the same password for serveral different websites.  After using it for a couple of weeks, most of the time not working properly, the final straw was that it suddenly stopped recognizing my Infovault password.  Several emails to Norton and nothing but worthless repsonses.  Hours wasted trying to get help from their website!  Even when I just wanted to know if I unstalled the product would password manager still work, no response.

I purchased this product with the hope that it will help me protect my computer without too much overhead and interference. The password manager is quite useless. In more than half the times it did not enter passwords. In cases where it entered passwords, it took about 5 seconds to do so. It also asked me if I want to store passwords repeatedly for the same site.

It interfered with the operation. It did not let me go to sites like paypal and charles schwab. When I contacted Symantec support, their response is to disable the Phishing protection when I want to go to these sites.

My quicken started having problems. I had to restore old backups and it took me 2 days to finally figure out that it is Confidential that is causing the problems. I would have given this s/w 0 stars if it is possible. Now, I uninstalled the software from my computer and have no intention of re-installing it.

I can't believe that a company like Symantec releases software that is so buggy and unusable

It's time to switch to any product BUT a Symantec one: what was once the best security software company for PC users is now the worst. 

It was time to upgrade my Systemworks Premier to the 2007 version, so I checked out the '07 features online. But where was Password Manager? Hell, I have 187 passwords and logins I DEPEND UPON Password Manager to fill in -- at least 30 of them a day. After an hour on the phone with allegedly 'English-speaking' Symantec CSR's in Bombay, the story I got was that customer surveys prompted them to 'drop' Password Manager. Not being stupid, I said, 'let me guess, Symantec's going to roll out a stand-alone Password Manager to extort another $40 from me'. 'Oh, no, sir, no, no...'

And here it is: a $[...] rip-off, nothing but Password Manager -- not so cleverly disguised as 'the Vault' -- along with other features IE7 provides for free, and marketed as a 'new' online security program. 

Symantec seems to put more effort into playing marketing games with their customers than they do into making the programs they sell WORK correctly. Norton Anti-Virus is a MESS; it's once-a-week Wednesday night updates are now a joke: launch your attack, release your new virus on a Thursday morning and you'll have millions of NAV subscribers at your mercy for at least a week. Three times in the past few months, NAV has failed to stop an attack -- after several years of never failing. Systemworks too seems to be causing more problems than it solves (I'm continually rolling back to undo 'fixes' One Button Checkup or WinDoctor creates, after the 'fix' crashes my system). 

Goodbye, Norton, hello McAfee -- or ANYBODY else. This rip-off -- deleting Password Manager from Systemworks only to regurgitate it as this bug-filled mess called Norton Confidential -- is the last straw

This product caused my IE 7 browser to hang just about every time I used it.  It causes internet pages to load very slow.  This product scans every internet page before it will load the page.  Many of the features that this product boasts come standard and FREE with the new IE 7 (such as phishing protection).  This product is NOT compatible if you use Norton System Works

I recently purchased this software and had to uninstall it.  In my case, I was unable to get into my Quicken account, which is password protected.  One of the features of Confidential is an "Information Vault" which stores all passwords.  I was prompted to enter the Quicken one as well, but chose not to as I felt this would defeat the purpose of having a password set up in the first place.  After that, when I would enter the Quicken password, my machine would just hang up.  The only way I could get in was by opening it in safe mode.  

I believe that this product sounds appealing on the surface, but when you get down to it, it promises more than it can deliver.  I also think that when it comes to internet security, the best solution is to take reasonable precaution.  If you respond to an e-mail requesting your account numbers and passwords, a software package is not going to save you.

I purchased this product based on my previous experience with Norton products and have been quite satisfied with their performance.  Thus, I was extremely disappointed with this product

As others have noted, this product prevents AOL from loading on my machine - it just stalls (AOL is using a connection via Cable). It also "automatically" registers itself with Symantec and starts the counting of the 1 year subscription unless you cut of internet access. I removed it from that machine (a Toshiba Laptop) and installed it on my backup Dell (an older Pentium 3 866mhz). Both were running XP with the latest updates.  It slowed Internet Explorer to a crawl and locked it up when I attempted to first write this review.  It also slowed overall performance, when not in the browser, though this seems illogical.  I uninstalled it (it was the only Norton product on the machine) and it left Live Update installed until I manually started the removal of it. Fortunately everything is back to normal after removing all.  This is truly dangerous software for those with at least my type of equipment:  Stay away unless you have very poor browsing security and a machine that does not choke on it

I purchased this updated version 1/5/07.  It does not print correctly, and technical support assured me that the developer is "working on the problem" and a "fix" is soon to come.  This is March 1, and no update is available yet.  This program is UN-USABLE and I am very unhappy and would not recommend "as is" to anyone.  I have the 2005 edition and was very pleased with it.  This is a large embarrassment to the Hallmark company

I bought this software to print my Christmas cards and much to my dismay, it did not print properly on my HP inkjet printer. I tried various settings with the same bad results and finally had to contact tech support via email.  Here is the reply:

"Thank you for contacting Hallmark Technical Support.

We apologize for any difficulties that you may have had with our software.

This is a newly found issue with the program.  The developers are currently working on an update that will correct this.  They said that the update should be out around Christmas.  Please routinely check for new updates by going to the Help menu and selecting the Check for Updates option.  When an update is available, you will be informed and it should automatically install the update."

This is a "printing" software so when it does not print properly, it indicates that the software was not tested properly or simply the publisher expect the users to be beta-testers!  If some other features that did not work, it may be excused, but this bug is unexcusable! 

I am sure the software developers will have the software bugs fixed, but at the meantime don't be a beta-tester,  buy someting else. Humbug!

I am a novice at web page creating and I am OVERLY glad I tried the free web trial (of course I lied about my address and my first born etc. that you MUST give to just get the so called "FREE" trial) this is the WORST web page editor for not so with it people.  It does not look anything even close to what frontpage had and again I am highly disappointed with it.  Where are the themes, web counters and the other simple to understand components ? I did try Namo Web Editor and for people like me, it is very good.  This may be wonderful for those of you who are very web page saavy but again if you are a novice don't get this or uprgrade to it, you will be HIGHLY disappointed

I hate to be rude but I have been building with FrontPage 2002 for years. It has so many templates and features but I thought it was time for an upgrade. I am thankful  that the original FrontPage is still running on my laptop or I don't think my latest sites would be up yet. Sorry, I don't mean to be mean. It may be like other programs that you can get training or have to take a class to do the things that FrontPages just does automatically. I'm sure it is fine as a stand alone creator software but to call it an upgrade, I don't know.

i pruchased the 3 computer product.  I installed and have been in email tag with norton support ever since. My computer will not shutdown after installation. They have no idea why.  I have been through the same protocols over and over again for over three weeks.  I was finally told that installing version 7.02 would fix it for sure.  I did and it did not.  
I was also told that unlike other products such as webroot, when you buy a three ciomputer pack, then expiration date is tied to installation on the first computer. If the three computers do not have the same installation date-like mine -i had 2006 installed on three computers which were put on at different times-you can lose the value of the subscription.  When I called Norton customer service -i get the reply that what can you expect we gave you a bargain-about 70 on a three computer deal.  The service was rude and not helpful.  I asked why it did not say anthing on the box or in the manual and was told that was my proble,

WARNING!! This was the worst experience I ever have upgrading software from the same co. I have Norton Ghost, Partition Magic, and 06 Internet Security on my laptop. After instructed to remove 06 IS, I installed the 07 Antivirus. Afterward I kept getting a pop-up Runtime Error msg and the product will not work. I went to the support site and follow the instructions to use their Autofix tool to completely remove all of 06 IS and LiveUpdate. I did so and reinstalled the Antivirus. STILL GOT THE SAME @#$%^ ERROR! I went back to the support site and was told to remove the old IS and upgrade to a new LiveUpdate first. I did so and reinstalled Antivirus. STILL GOT THE SAME @#$%^ ERROR! I called support and waited 30 mins. Finally was told I needed to pay $29 fee for live help. I returned the product and vow to never buy from Symantec again. I purchased CA Internet Security and installed without any problem.

There is no excuse for Norton not advising of the incompatibility of this antivirus software with popular firewalls such as ZoneAlarm before installing the software, especially since previous versions have been compatible.

I've been a loyal Norton anti-virus & utilities software customer since the stone age, but like several other reviewers, I'm deeply disappointed that Norton Internet Security 2007 is incompatible with ZoneAlarm Pro, Sunbelt CounterSpy, and Microsoft AntiSpyware, and even more deeply disappointed that I had to crack the shrinkwap to find that out. Once upon a time, Norton  was the epitome of well-designed, thoughtful, customer-centric software, but they've degenerated into outsourced hacks trading on a well-established name. I'll be returning Symantec's software if I can, and buying ZoneAlarm's A/V package instead

When I tried to upgrade from 2004 to 2005 I ran into a problem because I didn't have Flash 7.0 installed. Actually I had a later version of Flash (9.04) but of course Quickbooks couldn't handle that. Here's the fix: go to the Adobe site and download the uninstall program from them. Uninstall your flash player and then Quickbooks will then proceed. Good luck. Jo

I bought this software at the recommendation of my accountant.  Well, after trying to use it for two years now, I'm ready to burn it. It's a great software for people who do their business by the projects, but it's not good for retail sales.  Everything has been a hassel, especially trying to set up the daily sales so I can record detailed inventory of my daily sales.  Yes, I noticed they did come out w/a new version for specifically for retail sales.  After I already invested in $300 in software and $100 in books just trying to learn this system.  What a waste!

I have never ever used an application that was totally designed to get more and more money.  Every other page is a sales page and after paying $300 plus for the application and another $200 for the payroll, now I have to pay if I want their help.  It is a good tool but the company mission is to make more money, no longer has anything to do with their customers.
And this customer will not be one next year

Purchased this software because I got a deal with a special price break.  I have a very small business, so a purchase of several hundred dollars needs to pay back quickly.  

The set up took a lot longer than I had anticipated.
The customer service was no help - couldn't answer my questions.  I ended up spending 6 hours to get everything right - another day wasted.

I've got myself stuck with this now and will use for a few months since I've spent the money, but I'm going to look for alternatives in the meantime.  If this is "Quick Books,"  I need to find "Lightning Fast" Books somewhere

I purchased quickbooks 2005; 4th upgrade in 10 years.
Unlike earlier versions, this one is confusing and painful to use.

Simple things like making deposits has to do through contraptions.
 
One of the reasons I upraded was to use Online banking; it's a complete disaster. It doesn't download the complete trasaction details, reconcilliations are very difficult.
You will be doing twice the work to use it.

Once my transfer to the bank was aborted by a message saying you are low on memory and though Quickbooks sent the transaction to the bank, it didn't mark it internally, so on the next login, it sent the payment again!!! It has cost me $1509 of double payment that I am still trying to get back!

How you pay a bill is totally messed up, There is no way for you to mark that a bill was paid online unless it was done through quickbooks online connection. (Bank's billpay can't be used!!)

It's very poor in organization, you can't have 2 accounts #'s with  a vendor (still in 2005!!!).
It has introduced obscure concepts as items and classes, which have no real definition and no "default" use and stop every transaction.

One of the biggest thing Quickbooks has done to hurt their customers is the payroll. Technically you can do it yourself, but they hide that information and scare you in every step that you should (must) buy the $299/year payroll service (old tax-tables).
In all the documenation, not once do they mention that you can do the payroll directly and this is how.
Compared to the earlier products, this is a huge cost. By that reckoning I would have paid ~$2000 for the previous version of quickbooks!!

It's definitely cheaper to buy a basic version of the software and use an accountant to do the other work and you will be better 
off. Don't waste money on Quicken services or premium products, they will bleed you to death on your way to a mental asylum

What a terrible upgrade.  I'm going to uninstall it and go back to 6.  Even though I specifically told it to leave my file associations alone, it changed every one of them.  It's a nightmare.  I'm still trying to get Nero disassociated with certain file types, to no avail.  The backup program is awful, slow and much more difficult to use than the one built into 6.  Overall, Ultra 6 is a much better product.  I'm going to uninstall 7 and send it back to Nero with instructions on where they can associate it

The computer that I bought June 2006 came with Nero 6 OEM version.  It has worked very well.  I finally got around to clicking on the upgrade icon and ordered what I thought would be a serial number to unlock some features.  It turns out that is not available, and I have bought the Nero 7 Ultra version, which required a 195 MB download. Having dialup, I was not pleased.  I asked for my money back.  No response.  I faxed BBB complaint with copies to Nero offices in California and Germany. The office in Germany responded with email that they do not do refunds. Los Angeles BBB has been unresponsive. 
I finally got the download from a computer with broadband. I uninstalled Nero 6 and set restore point.  I installed Nero 7.  It worked!  But it was agonizingly slow.  I don't mean the CD or DVD writing per se was slow. When I eventually got it going that gave me the full speed of my hardware. However navigating from each click to response felt like it was in a 486 and not an Athlon 64.  I think other programs were also rendered more sluggish in opening files.
I uninstalled Nero 7, and just to be safe I then used restore point from before I installed it. I reinstalled Nero 6. What a relief!  There may be some fancy features Nero 6 OEM lacks, but it's worth it to have the computer working at reasonable speed. If I want to rip a music track to a .wav file (a feature lacking in the OEM version), it's easier to reboot to linux and run K3b than put up with sluggish Nero 7 Ultra to do it.

A product and company gone bad; Nero 7 is definitely not recommended

I'm in the midst of auditioning LCD panels and the local ISF certified guy wants $350 per panel to calibrate them. I like TV and everything, but there's just no way that I am going to spend $350 on TV that I might possibly keep. 

Still, the store settings on any two panels have two problems. First, they are amped up beyond compare as the TV vendors compete to be "who's the brightest" on the lit showroom floor. Sitting in my living room, they are far far too bright to watch. Second, they display colors totally differently. It's just hard to compare to 2 sets that are calibrated so differently.

Now the TVs that we are looking at cost a pretty penny, and it seemed that a couple of hundred dollars to inform the decision was a good idea, just like the hundred dollars for an HDMI splitter seemed like a good idea. The splitter was a good idea, the Spyder TV Colormeter not so much.

I calibrated 2 panels with this product. Two things are true about the calibrations. First, they do not look at all the same. The Sony panel has red shifted flesh tones while the Sharp looks cold and sterile. Second, they look way way worse than before the calibration. After 20 minutes of watching Casino Royale, it was time to revert back to a toned down version of the factory defaults for each.

At first I thought that I had not followed the instructions right. Maybe it was not dark enough. Maybe the sensor was not positioned right. Having done the process several times, I can state categorically that while the colorvision Spyder TV may not deliver good results, it is consistent in its delivery of bad results. 

I simply cannot recommend this product

I have the same problem that Xrayman does.
I was wondering if I had a faulty unit since it was an "opened" item and slightly discounted in the store where I bought it. I guess I'm not the only one who has this problem. My TV is a Plasma, for whatever that's worth. And I too found that the SpyderTV did not set things correctly. Color was much too saturated, and contrast and brightness were not correct. The only thing it did do was correctly choose the color temperature, which I do think is better than what I had it set to, so I'm now using SpyderTV's recommended color temp. But I reset everything else back to the settings I had already achieved by eye. I am going to try it out on an old CRT television and see if it works any better on that.

My plasma isn't new, and I would recommend that people do not use this product on a new plasma.  It requires you to put a bright white square up on your screen for far too long.  I had to run through 15 color temperature settings, letting SpyderTV take a reading on each one, while leaving the bright square up.  Took at least 7 minutes.  That will temporarily burn the square into a new plasma screen.  ...and might throw off the remaining measurements that have to be taken

When I first received the product and installed it I had a few configuration issues (not unusual) but now, after 8 months of service, they are telling me I need to purchase an upgrade ($69.99) or I will have no virus protection.  I contacted Customer Service (what a misnomer) as no one was available to actually speak to me and the automated system was like one of those automated phone loops you enter when trying to contact any company.  I finally gave up and an now shopping for a newer and more reliable antivirus and protection system.  I did not get a full year of service, got jerked around and have lost all faith in this software package.  I wish any other users good luck

Great software! Until You have a question or a problem that is. Then You get the run around BIG TIME! ZoneAlarm says they didn't sell it to me so they can't help me. They send me to Broderbund for help. Broderbund then sends me to Encore for help and they won't help me either. ZoneAlarm states if I didn't buy it right from ZoneAlarm then they don't give any support. 
 It comes in a ZoneAlarm box, says ZoneAlarm on the CD but apparently it isn't ZoneAlarm??? (According to ZoneAlarm that is)!!
 Buy it elsewhere, or end up helpless!!!

I have used the Zonlabs Firewall for several years. It works fine. I can not say the same for the Security Suite. The AntiSpam function does not update definitions and ZoneLabs Tech Support know they have a problem. They are working on it but no date for a fix.
Do not buy this software until all the bugs are fixed.

I do not have any recolection of purchasing this product, nor can I find it on my computer or in any of my hard non computer files. I have always ordered a hard disk back up of all purchases from Zone Alarm. There is no hard disk no Computer file. I am about to raise you Know what about this charge on my credit card. I will challenge it if I do not receive for what I am being charged. I will also ask My credit card Co. for a new number to prevent future charges from these folks. In the future I will use a third party encryted method for purchases on the internet.  rehadik@netscape

I really like the Rosetta Stone product (although it is over priced).

WARNING: Rosetta Stone (Fairfield Language Technologies) will NOT replace a CD if it is lost, stolen or damaged unless you bought the product DIRECTLY from them (and then they charge you $30 for a replacement CD).  I had the misfortune of purchasing from a local bookstore and someone had stolen the disk from inside the package.  In this case I can get my money back from the store I bought it from but since you can't backup the disks you had better be VERY careful to not lose one

Many repetitions are necessary in order to acquire a second language or a third, but the monotony of this program does not keep your interest for long, is so boring and offers not variety at all. This program will take away the excitement for learning another language even for the most motivated individuals, and will not help to acquire fluency because it does not equip you with the tools to construct language on your own. 

It does not contain essential grammar instruction, it is an error to suppose that the same grammatical rules of your language can be applied to other languages (French is not a translation of English, or Spanish, or any other language). Grammar becomes essential especially when you are trying to construct correct structures on your own; this program claims to help you learn "naturally" but leaves huge gaps by neglecting grammar, culture, conversational structures, and clear understanding, not natural!

For adults translation is necessary when trying to internalize the concepts, adults already have an understanding of language and are equipped to learn differently than children, sometimes even faster. I do not believe that "learning a second language like a child" is an accurate statement to describe this program, children are immersed in the culture, everything around them is the "real deal", not repetitious pictures and recordings. Children receive verbal and non-verbal input constantly, and adults have greater cognition than children do. 

Looking at a picture while you listen a recoding might give you a vague idea of what it means, but there is not accuracy. It is very unlikely that you will internalize a concept that you do not fully understand. Rosetta Stone approach might be very effective when memorizing vocabulary and simple sentences, but I could achieve the same by purchasing flash cards for a fraction of the cost of this overrated, and overpriced program.

I've used the past few versions of Acrobat and this one is a disappointment. Navigation is a pain. Instead of the familiar window and arrows at the bottom of a page Adobe's engineers have moved navigation to the top of the page and have only a single arrow.The whole look and feel is most unMac-like, more like a windows application. I suppose if I wanted to take the time and energy to study the user manual I would find the application friendlier but I don't expect to have to re-learn to use an application when I upgrade. If you're thinking of upgrading, my advice is don't

I purchased the standard edition of X3 primarily for 3 reasons: 1) It claims to have the ability to convert pdf files into WP format, 2) It claims to be able to organize your e-mail files through the use of WP Mail well beyond the capabilities of Outlook Express, and 3) It claims enhanced use of WP for word processing.

What I found was a product that met only one out of three of its claims.  In baseball, batting .333 will put you into the Hall of Fame.  In business, fulfilling one of three claims will put you into bankruptcy!

While the pdf converter is a rather good tool, WP3 Mail is unstable (and this is from their tech support department).  It destabilizes your use of e-mail to the point of making it virtually unusable in terms of reliability.  I imported older e-mail from outlook express when I installed the WP X3 software, only to later find out that the system crashed regularly.  I could not get at my older imported e-mail, and could not find a practical way to reverse the importing back into outlook express.  What really irked me was that their tech support was worthless in rectifying the situation.  They merely responded by saying they were aware of the problem and "may" release a patch to help sometime in the future.  Ahhhhh!

As to the alleged improved "word processing power", I have experienced more bugs then appear in an Animal Planet Channel special on insects in the Amazon Jungle.  Unwanted page formating changes occur when I click my mouse on the page I had just finish reformatting. Undesired line spacing would appear on pages.  The list goes on, but who has the time to be more detailed. 

Do yourself a favor and avoid the product.  If you need to upgrade, check out the latest version of MS Word, you will be far more satisfied I'm sure

I upgraded from Wordperfect Office 12 to X3, but have returned the upgrade to Wordperfect.  The much touted ability to import PDF files is so poorly implemented that it is all but unusable.  In addition, the Wordperfect Mail component will not load data files while my antivirus (ZoneAlarm) is running in the background.  Corel Technical Support takes no responsibility for the incompatability.  Do not upgrade unless these issues are addressed

Generally like the program. Hoped it came with a CD to practice in the car but was wrong. It is totally PC based. I'll let you know in about three months if I can actually conduct business in Deutsch.

I can't for the life of me understand why Rosetta Stone has garnered such good reviews (although I see a few negative ones here, so I feel validated) and seems to have such an outstanding reputation. I find it practically worthless, and it's expensive to boot. I'm sure that my experience with the German program would apply to Rosetta Stone's other languages as well, as they all taught via the same method. 

I've been learning German for about 6 months and besides Rosetta Stone I have used Pimsleur, Rocket Languages, and have taken private instruction. Obviously, private instruction is best. But this review is about software, and Pimsleur is best. But Rosetta Stone has more bells & whistles, which is perhaps why people think it is so good. But it isn't. For example, nowhere in Rosetta Stone do you actually learn how to say useful things. Nowhere do you learn how to say "Hello," "How are you, "What's your name," or even "Where's the bathroom." Instead, you will learn how to recognize such useful phrases as "The woman and the boy have a ball on their heads" or "The man is under the donkey" or "These two fish are from the same species" or "The blue triangle is bigger than the red square." Ridiculous!! And note I said "learn how to recognize a phrase." This is the biggest weakness and disappointment with Rosetta Stone. It really doesn't get you to talk at ALL. You are not required to utter a word. You see four pictures, and the speaker will say (in German) "The boy is drinking milk." Now, if you have already heard the word for "boy" (Junge) and three of the pictures have no boys, you simply click on the picture with the boy and presto, you're correct! This multiple choice way of learning is not effective for learning a language! (There is a "practice speaking" mode, equally useless, which I mention below) 

With Pimsleur, which is an audio only program, you hear conversations that will impart essential words and phrases. And they are repeated (and asks you to repeat) in such a fashion that it sticks. For example, it was weeks ago that it introduced "How much do I owe you?" yet I still remember it. (Wie viel shulde ich Ihnen?--No, I didn't cheat and look it up!) Pimsleur is brilliant in the way it gradually builds your knowledge and abilities. Of course, it isn't perfect as it doesn't explain the grammar. But neither does Rosetta Stone, and Rosetta Stone is worse because with Pimsleur there is also an English speaker who explains some things, while with Rosetta Stone you are left to twist in the wind. That's why software language learning programs should be seen as supplements--supplements to classroom or private instruction. 

What are the bells & whistles on Rosetta Stone? You get to do a lesson in a variety of ways--seeing pictures with audio (the speaker), or pictures with audio and text, or audio only, for example. There is also a feature where the speaker on the program says a phrase, and you repeat it into a microphone and can compare your voice signature to the speaker's. But I found that this didn't work well at all and wasn't worth the trouble. And again, the phrases weren't useful

I have many (too many) Rosetta Stone softwares for language learning, however after purchasing "Tell Me More" software I will never go back to Rosetta Stone. It is true that you can learn a lot of vocabulary with Rosetta's program but that is about it! Rosetta's software is very illogical! Honestly, do not waste your time and money with this program, check Tell Me More and you will be amazed

I found this product to represent extremely poor value for money.  I purchased the product based on all the marketing hype and testimonials.  However, I have since come to the conclusion that these guys must pay people to write positive testimonials.

This product only covers the basics (levels 1 & 2).  Then they try to rope you into paying even more money for their intermediate levels.

I have since purchased a cheaper 'Tell Me More' package (for Spanish) and have been highly impressed with the scope of it.  They have packed so much more value into their package.  And it is a complete package - all the way to advanced level.

I think it's really disgusting that Rosetta Stone get away with selling such a seriously inferior product at such a highly inflated price and people still buy it.  I think it borders on being a scam

I have been using this product now for almost a year. The only reason I insist using it is because I feel really bad for wasting my money. First, this is not worth $300 bucks.
There are only still pictures and sound. No movies or any fancy graphics, so why the price? Second it is very repetitive and it does not advance in a very logical way so that you recognize the grammatical structures behind the ever changing sentences. Third, the sentences that you have to repeat over and over are not practical at all. You keep memorizing thins like "the boy is under the airplane" or "the ball is on the boy's head".
Initially I thought, well this is because it progresses very slowly which is not necessarily bad. But then I took a look at the last lessons; you just keep repeating useless senteces like these without real things used on a dialogue. 
I cannot recommend you another course because I spent so much in this one that I do not want to try again and get disappointed. Don't be fooled by the wonderful reviews like I was. This is definitively NOT worth 300 dollars. It is not even useful for basic converstion. I have learned much more from simple travel books and cassettes from the library.
Ah, and if you think that by repeating these structures alone you will understand german grammar ..

Being a PC user for many years (since 1985)I have come through all the versions of MS operating systems (does anyone out there remember 3.5!) MS has also piggy backed this "robust" office product for 20 years.  Their upgrades are seldom anything more than a better looking toolbar.  This is no exception, but this time I like the tool bar!  As to ease of use, I use PowerPoint and Word often and my spouse uses Excel.  If there were an easier product available we would buy it but then Windows XP would kill it on sight and Vista would stop working altogether.  Why does MS think that everyone but those working in a professional since (hence Office for Professionals) needs all the junk they subject us to?  Do those guys in Redmond still think adult users of the PC like "cute" things like little doggies wagging their tail or a friendly paper clip to help you answer your every question!  I am tired of Beta testing MS products for so many years but as a PC user I am stuck with them and until someone else can come up with a better system, other than Mac, we are all stuck with them.

Office 2007 may seem ok at first.  The menus are all ok for me to use, so I don't have to build menus from scratch.  But after installing the trial, I found numerous complaints that would make me want to trash it if I had it.

1)  Word doesn't want to integrate with Outlook very well
2)  Everytime I want to send a mail message I accidentally click on 'Paste'
3)  The flags and categories for Outlook are annoying and just add to the time spent administering email without helping me more than Outlook 2003
4)  Along with all of the other Microsoft products I've tried in the past month, it hangs, corrupts its own files, and generally takes up too much memory.

I'll stick with Office 2003, which doesn't have nearly as many flaws.  There is no reason for me to upgrade.

I'm also back to IE6, Money 2006, and will not upgrade to Vista.

I've lost volumes of emails because I can't downgrade my Outlook files.

Good Job in alienating your customers, Microsoft.  (so what's new?

Normally I might wait to install a new software upgrade, but I just got a new laptop and thought it would be best to use Office 2007 with the new Vista operating system. I was wrong.

You would expect that a multi-billion dollar company like Microsoft could put out a powerful and bug-free piece of software. But after a month of using Office 2007, you get the distinct impression that this software is not ready for public release. Microsoft should be ashamed.

I don't know the root cause of my problems, but I have to stress that I am running a clean install of Office 2007 on Vista, so there shouldn't be any software conflicts or issues. 

So what are my issues? The list is long:

-- My biggest concern is that MS Word constantly hangs and stalls. It can making editing a document very painful. I suspect the problem is when I put images or Visio diagrams into a document. But that is something the old MS Word was able to do without an issue. Oddly, if I have a colleague open the document and save it out in Word 2003, the problem goes away! What?! It's killing my productivity.

-- When ever I cut and paste from an old document, Word hangs for 15 to 20 seconds. And often the formatting and margins in my new document go haywire. I keep having to spend a ton of time fixing things. This never happened in the old Word. This is another time killer.

-- Every few days, Outlook 2007 starts telling me that it cannot display my email folders. Uh oh! I have to completely restart my computer to see my email again.

-- Outlook 2007 breaks many graphic emails that people send -- they look like a mess. It is because Outlook 2007 does NOT render HTML correctly since it uses the Word engine, not Internet Explorer to display email. I have no idea why Microsoft did this, but they have got to fix it.

-- Many of the issues in the old Word 2003 still haven't been fixed. If you place an image, it can often be hard to get it to appear correctly. Why can't they solve this one?

-- While most Office programs have the new ribbon interface (which I like), some programs like Visio 2007 do not. So you have to remember how to use two interfaces. Couldn't Microsoft find the time and money to update ALL its programs? Give me a break.

-- On a few occassions in Visio 2007, my files have failed to save correctly. At first I thought this must have been my fault, but it's happened to me a few times and can't be a coincidence. A few times I've gotten an error message and lost my work. Ug.

-- Word and Excel 2007 use a completely new file format. So anyone you send a document to has to have 2007 installed (which isn't likely the case). To get around this, you can save it down to a 2003 file format, but then you end up with two files on your hard drive -- one in the new format and one in the old format. What a pain! Also, there definitely seems to be an issue with Office 2007 opening older Office 2003 files. Could be the cause of many of my problems, but there is no way I can avoid using old files. They should have worked harder on compatibility.

There are good things about the new 2007. I do like the new interface design and the new features in Outlook 2007 are amazing for organizing tasks and sharing your calendar.

But I don't think it's fair that Microsoft released a product so full of serious, serious bugs that have cost me hours and hours of extra work. I didn't spend hundreds of dollars on a beta product and don't think the public should have to suffer. Surely they can afford to do better!

Unfortunately, it seems once you have downloaded NAV 2007, your whole computer will not function properly. Internet Explorer malfunctions, and I also received a blue screen (fear of crash) stating that what ever program was recently installed, I should reinstall it. I did so, but the problems did not go away. I called Norton, they told me to run in safe mode without norton. My computer was back to normal, so it was Norton causing all the problems. I unistalled it and went with another product, after spending the $60 and many hours with Norton help desk. Don't believe me, do a search on any search engine, and you will see the many problems and no apparent solutions for this program!! Up till now, I have only used Norton, and never thought twice when buying the update. I'm now moving on to another product

I'm responsible for 10 computers at our organization. Last year we purchased Norton Antivirus 2006. It was such a resource hog that it stopped our older computers (550 Mhz) from working and I had to uninstall from all computers. After reading reviews that said 2007 was leaner, I tried to install this on 6 computers. Only 1 install went without problems. Installing on three other computers took 3 days, and I'm still not through with computer 5. Sometimes the program won't install. Once it crashes during install, it leaves behind broken code that prevents reinstall unless you use the Norton uninstall tool, which removes ALL Norton products. So in addition to uninstalling and reinstalling Antivirus, you also have to reinstall Norton Ghost or any other Norton products. On the computer I'm still fighting with the install went smoothly, but during the update the program hung up and now I can't open Norton Antivirus. Even worse, when I open a Word document, the Norton Antivirus starts scanning the document and freezes the computer.  What a nightmare

I did a little research after trying to install this product and found that Symantec is no longer rated very well for Anti Virus.  One site that states this is Consumer Reports (they are towards the bottom of the ratings).  It has become major bloatware and its stability isn't what it used to be.  Maybe this is why Peter Norton sold his interests and bailed out.  I am far from being a novice, but this thing gave me a fight the whole way.  So on with my saga.

First, this product was supposed to be for Windows XP and 2000 Pro.  Even the box says this.  But when I insert the CD in a W2K Pro machine all I got was an error box showing the error icon and the OK button.  Real informative.  Going through the back door I try to install without going through the CD autostart program.  Now I get a box that says it requires XP 32 bit.  So that leaves out 2 of the machines I bought this for.

So I go to a machine running XP.  First one loads OK, but it says it is incompatible with my firewall (ZoneAlarm) which I happen to trust a lot.  Then on the second machine it goes through the install (which takes 45 min) and then runs the autoupdate and hangs halfway through.  I finally had to abort it after it sat there an hour (I was hoping it was just another slow moment).  Rebooted and the program was no longer running.  Starting it up myself resulted in it failing to load.  Now I'm stuck, it won't allow me to uninstall nor reload it again.  Had to obtain a removal tool from their web site and it promptly removed every Symantec product on the machine.  Maybe this was the writing on the wall?

By now I'm a couple days into the drama.  Meanwhile, the first XP machine that loaded fine did another automatic update and guess what.  It locked up half way through.  Now it will not run and had to be removed the same way.

So I am now the proud owner of ZoneAlarm's Internet Suite.  It cost less than the NAV (both 5 user versions), and loaded much faster.  Ten minutes and I was done, where it was an hour into NAV when things worked and it loaded.  I am taking this up with Symantec and trying to get a refund.  They can keep it.  I've been less satisfied with every upgrade and this one finally broke the camel's back.  Maybe I'll try again someday if I come up with a new camel, but they don't grow well in Seattle.

ADDED 3-12-2007:   I have also noted that after removing NAV that things I could not explain before have been cured.  For instance, the web site [...] would not load many of it's pages correctly, they would show the text coding instead of html.  Now that I am NAV free, all of the pages on this site load with no problems.  Hmmmm..

Norton is still the 800LB. Gorilla of Antivirus software, but I think more and more people are realizing that bigger does not mean better!  
The old days when Peter Norton made an excellent antivirus program are long gone, and these days Norton is just a mass produced product of Symantec's.
Customer service is through an Internet Database, and you must pay over $40 just to speak with someone even when Norton lets you down and lets a virus slip in.  The biggest problem is that this program is a huge hog of system resources.  It is no wonder that the ratings are so poor on Norton these days. I bought Trend Micro's PC-Cillin and have not looked back.  There product is less expensive and includes free phone support, and they have received all sorts of awards for their product

Quickbooks "sunsetted" my previous version, forcing me to buy this horriblle, buggy software.  It lacks many of the features that I liked from my previous version (2003), runs much slower, uses 10 times as much memory, and is full of bugs.  I regularly need to run Windows system restore when all of my company data disappears.  Avoid this product at all costs.  Time that I used to spend on more important business functions is now spent trying to get this crappy software to work.  I have used Quickbooks for 12 years, and 4 editions, but this will be my last Intuit product.  I wish I could give it 0 stars

I've tried to be a loyal Quickbooks Pro user for 5 years now and at first this company provided a competent accounting product that was decent after you learned its idiosyncracies. But each year you will be forced to update ($$$) or your tax tables will not be accurate, and each year some of the capabilities will be lost and you will have to pay for them to be restored ($$$), each year the program will be more expensive to update($$$). I am not an unreasonable business owner and I don't mind paying for good service, but Intuit has turned into a unethical, money grubbing monster. They sunset and disable your software every time you download an update,  forcing updates and buying previously provided services (payroll tax tables, e-mailing invoices, printing 1099 and W2). This is especially true at year end, becuase they know they have you in a tax/year end crunch. Now they are even doing unauthorised billing of new services (last year they started charging quarterly fees for tax tables--this year they charge a mandatoy $300 payroll update as well as a $100 software update for the program itself.) Furthermore they charge your credit card without permission under the ruberic that its the same as the quarterly tax table fee. Honestly, consider some other program! This deceptive practice of software disabling and data blocking, combined with the dubious practice of sunsetting software every year has grown intolerable. I hope they get the class action suit they deserve.

I regret having purchased this product.  I have not been able to use it for two months, after finally giving up trying to get it to work.  I have a very nice laptop running Windows XP Home, and encountered many problems.  I tried all of the avenues available to me through QuickBooks, online, via email, and on the telephone.  I spent nearly 25 hours overall trying to get the numerous issues taken care of.  Here are just a few:  The program would not convert my Quicken data; random script errors when you try to access help topics within the product; the phone # provided in the payroll demo is invalid; None of my info was viewable after bank download - it spontaneously failed to download my bank account info, after having successfully downloaded it for about two weeks.  I spent 2 & 1/2 hours on the phone trying to resolve just this one issue.  Part of the problem lies in the fact that I was unable to speak to a customer service person who's first language was English.  Each time I was on the phone, the customer service person seemed to continually ask me to re-describe the problem, then he/she would seem to be typing the info into the computer and waiting....then eventually telling me some solution to try, then eventually telling me they did not know what the problem was.  Not helpful in any way, though very polite. I'm sorry to say that this is a terribly designed, convoluted, over-complicated, non-user-friendly item which I would like to toss over a cliff.

I have used a lot of software, but I do not remember using much that is as difficult to use or learn than Quickbooks.  I have learned it over time, but there seem to be several functions in it that could be done in fewer steps.  I would not upgrade unless I absolutely had to.  The program is usable, but I am not interested in investing a lot more money in it.  It works for my small business, but I could still probably get by with Quicken, as I do not write checks on it.  I do kind of wish I had stayed with Quicken.  The most annoying thing about the program was that I was going credit card data downloads in Quicken, but when I changed to Quickbooks, it would not let me download data from my Quicken credit card, it wanted me to switch to a Quickbooks credit card, or ask permission of all my credit card providers.  I appreciate the security, but since both programs are made by the same company, this just seemed like a scam

I purchased this program with the intention of entering a bunch of typewritten pages into my computer.  The document that this program produced from newly typed material was so full of errors that I simply had to re-type.  It would have taken longer to correct than to re-type.  When I talked to Textbridge about these problems all they would tell me is that the program was not meant for such use and that I should buy one of their other programs which had good optical character recognition capabilities.  In other words, they know the product is not any good and they are not willing to stand behind it.  The program is useless for optical character recognition work or anything else

This product simply does not produce accurate results. It skips entire lines, words on the same line, and misreads even the most legible characters. It came bundled with my scanner, so at least I did not waste my money on it. Don't waste yours

I have been a faithful Mia fan for 5 years and have bought all the other games for my two kids. This game is a big disappointment. The language game is virtually unplayable in French. I am fluent in French and went to a French language university for nine years. I could barely understand what the characters were saying. If this program is intended to teach kids a second language, it would be more likely to turn them off the language instead. This game definitely does not cater to anyone who does not already have an understanding of French

I can't even comment on the actual System Works application because I never got it to run - it ruined my system right after install!  Once I installed it, it asked for a reboot, then came back wtih "Load Error!  Press a key to reboot..." which just lead to the error message again, and again, and again. 

A chat with tech support (after an hour wait) revealed that there are problems with the GoBack files, so I had to create a bootable CD, and do all kind of things which I haven't been able to do yet since my burner software doesn't have Image capability - necessary for creating this bootable cd.  

Don't buy it, don't install it, don't use it - uninstall everything Norton/Symantec and never go back.  I'll be lucky if I ever get my computer working again.....Thanks Symantec!!!!

I have uninstalled SystemWorks 2006 and will not be going back to Symantec products. I had three problems:

1. On initial install of SystemWorks in January 2006, the "GoBack" module wiped my hard drive. This was annoying and not easy to fix.

2. I reinstalled (and had to reregister) without the GoBack module and used the software for several months satisfactorily. A few annoyances: CleanUp consistently (every night) deleted cookies and autofills I wanted to keep, so despite my entering them as exceptions in the options table, they kept disappearing.

3. I wanted to move to a faster hard drive. After following the Norton Ghost directions explicitly (and getting a "successful" message, the cloned drive would not boot up. I therefore went back to my old drive. SystemWorks required me to reinstall (and reregister). In December, after renewing my SystemWorks subscription for $49.95, I successfully cloned the disk (using EZ Gig II). Again, the only software that did not work on boot up was SystemWorks. I called customer support and was told that the server would not allow me to install on more than 3 computers. I explained the circumstances but was told "there was nothing to be done," and that I would have to buy the software again. I chose not to.

I have completely uninstalled the entire program and am now enjoying faster performance from the operating system and quicker boot times from Word, Photoshop, etc. The protections I was getting from SystemWorks are being covered by AVG AntiVirus (shareware), Registry Mechanic (shareware), SpyBot (shareware), and DiskKeeper ($30), and Microsoft's Malware Guard (free).

I have been using Norton/Symantec products for over 15 years. Never again

Installed this on my laptop and desktop computers.  One installation was late in 2005, the other was in 2nd quarter of 2006.  Both have tried to fail.  The laptop will no longer do automatic updates.  I can manually download and install the updates, but it is a bit of a hassle.  The desktop will no longer download the Symantec updates at all.  I attempted several uninstalls and reinstalls, won't do it.  The only remedy is to take both computers to a computer shop and needlessly pay someone to fix the mess this junk software has made on both computers.  Because of the problems, I've run into several problems, mostly related to .cab files when I attempt downloads.  I've switched to AVG and Zone Alarm - both FREE and they work

I recently tried to update my Norton Systemworks.  Halfway through the update, I got a message telling me it was unable to uninstall my old Norton Systemworks.  I tried to back out of the installation at that point, but was unable.  I called the Norton company, spent an hour on the phone with a tech, only to have them tell me it was my computer.  I assured them that I was just using my computer, which was fine, and now it doesn't work.  They told me there was nothing further that they could do, and that I would have to call a computer service company.  I found out that the uninstall process corrupted my operating system, causing me to lose everything on my hard drive, and requiring a new operating system.  I have run into other people who had exactly the same problem, with no help from the Norton Company.  I will never again buy a Norton product.  I only wish I could get my money back from them.

I've been a loyal user of Systemworks (also "Utilities" & AntiVirus) for many years, frequently buying upgrades as I moved through various Windows OSs.  The latest verison (2006) has been a big disappointment.

1) The "integrator" repeatedly crashes (and "must shut down").  I was told to reintall (it took 4 hours).  Tech support (email) was slow and barely intelligible.

2) The full scan now takes over 8 hours on a modest sized system.

3) The utilities have not been substantially improved in 5 years

4) The rebate (for upgrade users) came in the form of a debit card, not a check.  (What a hassle!  I don't want any more "plastic"!)

5) Turning the Norton protection off substantially speeds up my PC.  What the heck is going on back there?

During the next year, I'll be looking for a new Anti-Virus support product.

Cheers, Joh

I "upgraded" to NORTON'S 2006 Version of Internet Security and Virus Protection software online. Included was Norton SystemWorks. I have used Norton anti-viral software exclusively for several years without any major problems. And yes, I always remove my previous version, before adding new software. Even though my internet connection is via private satellite antenna, it took almost two hours for the product to download and install.  Then when I rebooted my laptop (a new high-end Sony Vaio with Windows XP), it froze up during startup. I won't go into all the hassle involved, but after THREE removals and downloads over a period of several weeks, it became apparent that there was something SERIOUSLY wrong with NORTON'S 2006 Product. It caused crashes on almost a daily basis, and updates always took an excessive amount of time. Customer service was no help at all, and the company refused to refund my purchase price. I've since switched to a different brand of anti-viral internet protection software and have had no more problems with my computer. After this experience, I will NEVER use NORTON products again. The only reason I gave this a 1-star rating is because it's the lowest rating available. It should actually be MINUS 5 STARS for the aggravation and time and money wasted

I've been a digital artist for 5 years and always loved and supported PaintShopPro and Corel products. I have to say I am very disappointed in the new version, PSPXI. 

No problems with the download, but the program crashes easily, you can not drag and drop as fast as in 9, basically is slower in everything you do. I am a photographer, and looked forward to the new photo features, which work, but for panoramas and complicated work others than one photo forget it. Just hangs up and so slow you could go have dinner in between.

I have searched the net and support wise, the upgrades and patches have not helped. Corel is not solving the problem and maybe they can't. This is not a PC problem which they so want us to believe. I have plenty of memory and speed on my PC. It may be something involving how the XI stores it's cache. Not sure. But the changes are not workable, sadly.

I think there are some corrupt files or driver problems that Corel desparately needs to fix and supply us with, or they will find themselves out of the PS market. This is not just me talking, it has happened to alot of loyal fans. Because it could be the better than Photoshop if they fix it.  If you really want the program, download the free trial first and or try the X or 9 version, especially if your PC is an older model.

I buy this dvd from Amazon and try to play it but my desktop can't read any data on the dvd, like it's blank. So I send it back for a replacement and it has the same problem. Both my desktops can't read any data on the dvd but my laptop can play it fine. Next I contact Git Corp and they say burning software can conflict with it so I uninstall Nero and it still wont work.
Git Corp says they don't know what the problem is and passes it to their developers. I haven't heard back from them. All 3 comps run XP, 3 different dvd drives, don't know what's wrong! I have no problems playing the Avengers, Spiderman, or X-Men dvds

Summary: 
I wasted a lot of time trying to make this work, and I eventually went back to other products.  

In theory, integrating virus checker, firewall, spyware, and data backup into a unified suite (like MS Office with Word, Excel, & PowerPoint) makes sense.  However, this software package seems poorly made; it did not work very well for me.  

Hardware, OS, & primary software used: 
1.  Dell Lattitude D620 Laptop with 2GB RAM, Windows XP, MS Office
2.  Dell X1 Laptop (thin/lightweight) with 2GB RAM, Windows XP, MS Office
3.  Dell Dimension Desktop with 4 GB RAM, Windows XP, children's games

Prior virus/spyware products: 
Lattitude & X1: Norton
Dimension: freeware provided by our ISP

Theory:  Since Microsoft makes the OS & office applications that get infected with viruses, their product should be better integrated with the OS.  There will be synergy by integrating several related software applications.  

Lesson: 
Well, after a series of terrible experiences, I hope others will benefit from my wasted time: 

1.  Instead of loading most of the program from the CD & downloading small updates, this seems to load only a small part of the program and downloads huge files.  This made me feel that the product was shipped unfinished.  You had to do this separately for each machine since it hides the downloaded files then deletes them prior to finishing the installation.  This took a better part of an afternoon.  

2.  I purchased a 3-pack license.  Installing and activating the software on the 2nd & 3rd machines required a series of very annoying steps that involved logging into their website with broken links.  It finally required a phone call.  At least, the phone support experience was good. 

3.  The product promises to minimize performance impact, and improve overall performance.  On the Lattitude & Dimension (powerful machines), there was no difference in performance, but we could notice a slightly slower performance with the X1.  This was later verified when we uninstalled the MS Windows OneCare and replaced it with another product.  

4.  The product has difficulty updating.  It opens a small message box that asks you to click to update OneCare, but that takes you to a webpage that only works about 1 in 4 times.  

5.  Except for the first time, data backup always has several errors that I have to manually fix.  This has very rarely happened with other data backup software I've used.  

6.  Some applications, the firewall asks everytime for permission to connect to the Internet although the application is in the list to always allow this connection.

This is a simple drawing program, much like Paint. Don't be mislead by the colored picture on the cover, it only does black and white. And it has no help in drawing Manga figures. And it is a stripped-down program, at that. The documentation is for the full program, so you can't do much of what you read in the manual and help files. Save your money, this program isn't worth buying

Before using ColorVision Spyder2 my monitor was calibrated with the free Adobe Gamma program installed as part of Adobe Photoshop. My monitor looked great and the photos I printed looked great too. The colors were spot on. After using Spyder2 Express my monitor looks worse. My monitor appears dim, the color temperature is too warm and colors look green and dull. If I had known it was going to ruin my already great looking monitor I wouldn't have wasted my time. My hope was that it would make my monitor look better, not worse. I am not at all satisfied with this product wouldn't recommend buying it. Instead try Adobe Gamma or look for other free monitor calibration software tools online

I'm an amateur photographer and I use Photoshop CS2 for most of my digital editing.  I decided I needed a colorimeter based on the recommendations of many books that I have read on digital editing.  

I had to download an update of the software program before I could start using my Spyder.  This procedure alone took several hours because I kept getting "error" messages.  I can't count how many times I unloaded and reloaded the program.  I was eventually able to run the program, however, every time I calibrated my one year old Emachine CRT monitor, it left me with an orange color cast on my screen.  I worked with ColorVision technical support for many frustrating hours.  The technical support person I was working with was very pleasant and really tried to help me.  They even mailed me a new sensor because they thought the first one was defective.  Unfortunately I was unable to get the orange color cast removed from my monitor.  After several weeks of trying to get the Spyder2 Express to calibrate my monitor, I gave up.  I just didn't want to spend any more time trying to get it to work so it was returned.  I really wanted it to work.  I'm back to using Adobe Gamma.

I had some difficulty with the product loading the default profile, then the product asked later for a re-input of the serial number, which I no longer had.  No big deal, contact customer service, right?

Contacted customer service via email once, got no response.  Sent a second email, and got a response asking a follow up question, since then nothing, no response, nada.  All follow ups ignored.

Perhaps this product will work for you, but for me, it ultimately went into the trash because of Colorvision's refusal to respond.  Don't support this product, they won't support you

The product is so so, there are others that do the same thing for a bit less. But Colorvision thinks it owns the worlds so when it comes o support - you are screwed. Between putting you on hold for ever, not calling back etc.

Unlike versions up to No. 6, this version require authorization. This means that a single use version can't be loaded on multiple computers. Adobe informed me that this was not a bug and wanted me to buy multiple copies eventhough I am only using one computer at a time. This version forces you to take off the old legal version in order to install. When I found out that my legal version couldn't be used, it forced me to reinstall version 6, this took almost an hour to install, reboot, un-install and reinstall the orginal version. Why is Adobe the only company that forces this? Their program installation don't even skip from one set of four numbers to the next. They force you to type the dashes between the numbers. 

If you have multiple computers stay away from anything above version 6

Worked okay until I installed XP Service Pack 2.  Now I can no longer scan using my Brother MFC-9700 and Paperport 9.  It has been a long time since Service Pack 2 was released, and Scansoft has left everyone who bought Paperport 9 in the cold.  I could not care less if they now come up with software that is compatible with SP2.  This kind of treatment of customers makes it clear that they do not deserve our business.  Don't take my word for it.  Google the issue, and you'll find out that there are a lot of dissatisfied customers.  From now on, I'll avoid Scansoft

I was very excited to get this product.  It scans well, files well, is very sexy and promising.  Then I decided to Search for a few files based on my Keywords.  Oooops!  It won't search!!
If you don't know already, PaperPort offers you only one free tech support call.  After that it's $20 a pop.  The rather surly technician I reached had me re-install my program.  Okay, but it still wouldn't search.  Then he told me to un-install Windows Service Pack 2.  Uh uh, no way.  Nada.  That's when I asked for a refund.
I bought MyCab for $40.  Tech support is marvelous, within one hour over the Internet.  The only thing it doesn't do is scan within the program, but then I can do that, can't I?

I have used both Paperport 8 and Paperport 9 Deluxe for over a year so I am qualified to report.

Both pieces of software have some form of severe incompatibility with Windows XP Pro.  

I cannot really get version 9 to operate.  Everytime I try its like cold molasses.  Click...wait....wait....wait...wait...and then lock up.

I'm very experienced.  I've been working with PCs since 1991.  Every other piece of software I've loaded works very well...except for Paperport 8 and 9.

In theory Paperport 9 should be fine because it converts all scans to PDF which is more or less a universal file format.  However theory is a lot better than reality.

Support is nonexistent from ScanSoft.  If you pay the $19.95 per incident, you still do not get a solution.

The ScanSoft forum is always either not working (another bad sign) or it's full of people complaining about the software and lack of support.

Unfortunately there are not a lot of alternatives, but doQments looks promising.

Avoid Paperport unless you have money and time to waste

I needed a document management system. After looking for software, there only appeared to be Paperport. 

I had read somewhere that the software becomes incredibly slow with a large number of files. I guessed a large number meant 2500+ at least.

This concerned me, so I called pre-sales at ScanSoft, and asked if it was slow with a large number of files. He was not sure! So he told me to call technical. I called technical, and it his responses were very slow and sounded like he was reading them out to me. I asked if he was reading the ScanSoft website and he said yes, so I hung up. Obviously I read their site for an answer, and did not need to be paying international call charge for someone who seemed less knowledgeable than myself to read it.

I got the software. Basically all the software consists of is windows explorer and scanning software. It worked well, and I thought OK, expensive for what it is, when Windows Explorer and scanning software (usually free) would nearly do most of it, but THEN after around 560 PDFs, it started running VERY slow.

I thought it was my machine so installed it and the PDFs on a new Vaio 1.7Mhz, 1 gig laptop. Same problem. If you click to view the PDF then hit the return back, it takes 12 seconds! So if you view a document, it takes a good few seconds but then when you hit back to the Paperport Desktop to continue it takes 12 seconds!!! Completely unusuable!

If you have less than 500 files, it is maybe expensive software, but for more than 500 do not waste you money. It runs so slow you can not use it. I wonder how ScanSoft get away with it - surely they should have tested it internally with thousands of files

I got my DVD a few weeks back and discovered I could not read any of the files form the 1990s. I tried on several computers I have in the house and came to realize that the DVD is defective. I contacted Gitcorp about the problem and they informed me they would send me a replacement disc. 

Problem is that after nearly four weeks there hasn't been any DVD and repeated attempts to contact Gitcorp has resulted in no reponses.

Update, after continued emails to Gitcorp, I finally got a replacment DVD. They didn't even ask to see the original bad DVD. So my rating of this product would go up if I could. If you buy the product, check it closely, and get in touch with Gitcorp as soon as you find any problems. They can be very slow about responding

The game is called Fritz and Chesster. Fritz is the boy. Chester is a rat. That girl you see in the picture, her name is Bianca. She never actually plays. She just says things like "Well done, brave knight!" and asks stupid questions. At one point poor Bianca points out that the queen is the strongest piece, and Fritz makes a comment about his mother chewing out his father. The tone and context are extremely anti-woman, in my opinion. He also counters by saying that boys are smarter. 

It seems like the makers of this game were really threatened by the fact that you have to call the most powerful piece "she". To take the queen down a notch, they refer to a group or queens as a harem. To demonstrate how this powerful piece moves they have the queen run around picking flowers as fast as she can. A male voice says, "Off you go," in a tone which one can only assume is meant to accompany a little pat on her behind.

I agree with reviewer Mr. Dietz.  I was eager for my child to learn chess and we bought this new on Amazon for $24.99.  Put it in and loaded it in.  This game is so confusing and there are no instructions at all. No help menu either.  We wasted at least 2 hours on it before I ejected it and apologized to her.  There is nothing here to learn chess from

I was looking for an intructional CD to help my daughter to learn chess.  I read the reviews and endorsements and thought that this was what I was looking for.  WRONG!

First of all, the CD comes with no instruction book and you're left to try and figure out what you're supposed to do by yourself (good luck). I've spent over 2 hours on this thing so far and I still haven't seen one thing that would help my daughter to learn to play chess.

I've emailed their 'help line' hoping to get some answers and never heard back from them.

Save your money and your sanity and don't buy this CD.

I am a software tech. I first "free trial" V6 online-
1. Finds 131 errors, but will only fix 4 (must buy full version!). SHEESH!
2. Buy full version with 20% off coupon (3 computer lic, for only $9.95 more- their web site).
3. Does NOT remove left/overs..., from old uninstalled pgms. (Fix-it Utilities "6" safely did- read my review).
4. Then they only support updates... for 1 year- auto-renew! RIP-OFF!

I got a refund, and will NEVER use them again

Be warned, this product does not support all advertised features on all phones.  Right out of the box I found it did not support 2 of our 4 cell phones.  Of the phones that it did support, the only sync features available were photo downloading and calendar sync.  The ability to transfer other data such as movies, contacts and ring tones were not available for my particular phone.  Without all of the advertised features are available I consider this a complete waste of money

After using TurboTax couple of years and then using TaxCut for last two years (2005 and 2006 returns) I concluded that TurboTax is much superior software. TaxCut's only advantage is that it is cheaper. If you take out price from the equation, TaxCut is inferior in quality.

- In 2005 TaxCut software there was not PDF output of all the forms. This was pretty silly because after couple of years if I want to access my tax return I am not going to install TaxCut again in my computer and view by return. I would rather have have my tax return available in some widely acceptable format like PDF and then access/distribute whenever I want (I don't keep my documents in hardcopies). So I wrote to H&R Block. This year they added that saving return in PDF file feature available. But unfortunately, this is far from being perfect. It excludes number of important forms - example, IRS form 8853, California Adjustment Schedule 540CA etc. Instead of that it saves numbers of useless worksheet (without any data entered in those worksheets), same form multiple times.

- Most annoying thing about this software is updating incorrect data. In one form I entered wrong data. While reviewing it I found a problem and went to that specific section to update. But in calculation TaxCut still showed old incorrect number. I just could not make it to use new corrected number. Eventually I had to restart a new return from scratch - just to have an dollar amount corrected.

- In many section useful Helps are missing

We were big fans of TaxCut, especially after Turbo added spyware ..... THIS YEAR'S TAX CUT has irreguarities that are costing ($$) me ......... for example, you file your college student's return and check the box that she/he will be an exemption on the head-of-household return & then comes the surprise, head-of-household can't file their return with that college student as an exemption, despite checking the proper boxes! ....... for example, it can't caluculate railroad retirement benefits ..... for example, it tells you that your return is a-okay, you pay $15, then it tells you afterward that of the glitches and wants another $15 to refile! ........ good-bye Tax Cut!

H&R block does a much better job marketing software than writing it. I used the on-line version, had trouble registering so chose the option to begin entering data and register later. After about an hour of painfully slow entry, sometimes just one item per page, most of the time looking at "LOADING, PLEASE WAIT" I had to keep an appointment so tried to register and save. No luck, repeated attempts to register gave unidentified error, and I could not save without registering. Finally just left the computer on and left; when I came back TaxCut had timed out and lost all my data. By the way there is a screen which looks like you are accepting the terms of a software agreement but if you read the fine print you are agreeing to let them sell your e-mail to other companies. Even if you select NO you will get frequent e-mails from H&R Block. I will save time and do my taxes on paper forms this year. When a company can't get something simple like this right, it calls into question everything they do

Two weeks ago I attempted to do my taxes on this software.  However, it couldn't complete the hybrid car tax credit portion so I could file.  I had two weeks until the update was available.  I downloaded it just now and entered the new questions regarding the hybrid and was told I had a credit of $3,100.  However, it never added this number to my total tax credits.  All customer support could come up with was "Start over from scratch, don't even import your information from last year's Taxcut".  Never again

Microsoft continues their legacy of software that doesn't work. I've been using Windows since the very beginning and 2000 professional and windows xp was about the only solid operating systems Microsoft has released. You would expect this so called upgrade to further improve upon this, instead it is many steps backwards. BTW, I have a 4400 AMD, 3 gigs of ram, and can say that Vista is SLOW SLOW SLOW. Be prepared for everything to run slower than it did on XP. Cool interface, about the only positive thing about Vista I have found so far. Searches are also much faster, but hardly a reason to upgrade. Be prepared for Windows Updates after installing Vista that actually cause once working drivers to stop working. I'm tempted to go back to XP, so needless to say a big waste of time and effort.

In short: too expensive, all eye-candy, no driver support from third parties, and the licensing model makes a re-install impossible without a telephone call to Microsoft to verify that you are not stealing their software!

I upgraded my Dell desktop system from XP media center to Vista Ultimate to "fix" several problems I was having with XP. I found this to be a bad decision. I first installed the 64 bit version of Vista, but found that there are virtually zero third party companies that support 64bit Vista! No drivers, no working printers, USB devices, No internet security suites, etc! I then decided to upgrade to a larger hard drive. The Maxtor utility transfer utility did not work with Vista at all! It totally produced an unbootable system that the install CD could not fix. I then re-installed the 32 bit version of Vista Ultimate included in my upgrade box using the same license key. The on-line activation said that I already had this key in use and the only choices were 1) buy a new copy, 2) type in a different license key, 3) use the telephone to call Microsoft. I called Microsoft and found that their automated assistant could not help and was transferred to a person with a semi-strong accent who asked if this was the first installation and then asked if I was using it on the same machine (yes, it's the same machine). He then read a very long activation key to me that I had to type in. I find this totally unacceptable. 

the 32 bit version has better third party support, but it's not great yet. I'm using a lot of beta drivers that I had to search hard to find. The changes in the OS are mostly eye-candy from the end-user's perspective. I find the new licensing model and policies assume you are guilty first, and then makes you prove it. In doing so, Microsoft is burdening the bulk of their honest customers with a lot of effort to just make their software activate. Jack-booted policies like this will result in me buying from Apple next time. At least Apple treats me like the honest customer that I am!

I have thought well of every operating system since DOS 3.1.  This is without a doubt the worst system I have ever seen.  Not only is it NOT graphicaly intuitive, it is incompatible with most all of my 32 bit software.  Trying to use Quicken will crash the computer.  It is going to cost a bundle to upgrade all of a person's softwarein order to use Vista.  The only thing you will get out of running Vista is a lot of headaches

It's not because it's so slow that I hate it, it's because Microsoft has decided that I'm too stupid to know what I'm doing so they've decided to protect me from myself and won't allow me to even look at what's on my hard drive. Every mouse click now takes 3 or 4 clicks for the same thing. It's so confusing to look at my documents folders, I can't figure out what is where. I can't view web pages on my own site because they aren't in the security frame of safe. All my USB WiFi devices don't work on Vista and the only ones available are extremely expensive. My cousin bought a Vista installed laptop and with customer support couldn't get it connected to his WiFi router at home because of security issues, so he took it back and got one that has XP Media Center on it for less. I was given a full, licensed copy of Vista Ultimate and I will not install it on any of my computers. If MS stops supporting XP and I have only Vista available in a PC, I'll buy an Apple

VISTA is appropriated named.  VISTA defines something great to look at.  If all you did was look at Microsoft Vista it would be the perfect operating system indeed.  Unfortunately Vista is a computer operating system that was designed to be used and there is the problem.  Vista is so secure and so over burdened with layers upon burdensome processor power robbing layer of sheer garbage it is rendered totally completely and utterly useless.

Vista will take the fastest XP computer and turn it into a slow worthless pile of trash.  Vista is so slow it takes me back to the days when I used to walk away from my IBM AT computer get a cup of coffee and walk around the building.  What makes Vista worse still is Microsoft Office 2007 the absolute pits in word processing.  Add Office 2007 to Vista and you won't be productive at all but dang won't it look pretty. If you just want to watch your computer make pretty colors and areo-glass catch yourself some goofs watch Vista.  When you want to work and be productive turn on your XP computer.  Windows 2000 and XP work hard while Vista Hardly Works at all.  Vista is garbage don't buy this dreck!

Everything you try to do on Vista is not allowed.  Almost every peice of equipment you run on Vista needs to be updated to so called Vista friendly versions.  The messed up Windows explorer to the point to where it is beyond useless.  The problem with Vista is that Microsoft had taken all the wizards and helpful features far as they could in XP.  In Vista they had to try to top a operating system that pretty much did what you asked of it with little fuss.  In Vista the software code writers were just changing things because they could.  Vista makes nothing better or easier.  In fact Vista is built in a manner that almost seems to go out of its way to make even the most simple compater related tasks unpleasant needlessly long boring and tedious.

In a word TEDIOUS IS THE BEST SINGLE WORD TO DESCRIBE MICROSOFT WINDOWS VISTA.  VISTA HAS SUCCEEDED IN BRINGING THE ENTIRE COMPUTER EXPERIENCE IS PAINFULLY NEW LEVEL OF THE PURELY TEDIOUS THAT HAS NOT BEEN DREAMT OF BEFORE!  I just wish I could give Vista no stars or more honestly a negative star rating.  I won't be buying Vista for my current systems and even when I get a new computer I will not be using Vista is it comes pre installed.  I have my own old trusty XP disks and I will reinstalled XP the last useful usable operating system Microsoft made.

XP is the goofy kiddie skool like interface is ugliest operating system Microsoft ever made but while it was an ugly duckling it did work pretty well.  Vista is by far the prettiest operating system Microsoft has ever made but it is pretty and dumb.  Vista is over burdened with programmatic junk has a way to high opinion of itself.  Vista is so much more secure because all the dumb security features make the operating system unusable.  Any computer you make unusable is the most secure because you can't do any productive work on it.  Vista makes your computer experience endlessly tedious and makes your computer system a must see door stop.  The philosophy of Vista seems to be that a good computer should be seen but never productively used.  Vista is a great system for that  well monied executive that wants to look busy while doing nothing productive

Turbo Tax is fine. The linking into Quickbooks Pro (QBP) is limited to only the most recent 2 versions of QBP. So if you have an older version (older than 2005) you have to buy the new QBP to have Turbo Tax lift the data out of QB. Now Intuit will only sell a new version of 2007 - NO MORE UNGRADES. "For the consumer" they will tell you. BS, I will be changing accounting platforms as soon as I can find a replacement. This is the problem with software oligolopies! An Open Source replacement is much needed for both Tax prep and accounting.

Several years ago I used DeLorme's Street Atlas with a USB GPS receiver. The software worked but the interface was lousy. This year I tried Microsoft's Streets and Trips 2007 and was surprised to find that it has an interface that is smoother in some ways than the Delorme software, but still surprisingly clumsy. And the help is possibly the worst I have seen in a Microsoft product (that's saying a lot). Here are some of the problems:

1. Street & Trips is expecting a GPS receiver that uses a **COM PORT**. Are you kidding me? In 2007??? The Delorme Earthmate 20 (usb) will work if you use the delorme com port emulation software, but why is this necessary??? (And it was not trivial to get it to work.)

2. The handling of pushpins (identifying spots on the map), favorite places, and the like, is extremely clumsy. (Although, contrary to another review, you don't to re-enter the information each time. You just save the file and reload it.)

3. Directions are sometimes not so great. Why would you instruct someone to "turn left" if you don't know which direction they're pointing (e.g., when you're stationary in a parking lot)? Much better in such cases to say "head NE" or some such. Freeway exits (at least in So. California) were often not handled well. (One freeway entrance was identified as a "local road", which at the time proved quite confusing.)

4. Why doesn't the software automatically recalculate directions to put you "on-route" once you're off-route? You can push F3, but why is this necessary?

5. I never got the voice providing driving guidance to work. The online help was useless. I'm sure someone can jump in and tell me how to do it, but it should be trivial.

6. In general, the software has the feel of a bunch of modules written independently and thrown together. I'm not a reflexive anti-microsoft bigot (I bought this software after all), but I find that much MS software is bad precisely because it feels like it's cobbled together without much attention given to integration. It's shiny on the surface but the shine vanishes once you really start to use it.

Given this experience, I will probably give the Delorme software another try next time around.

I've used MS Streets and Trips for years with minor problems.  This year I upgraded to a Windows Vista Laptop and wanted the latest software for it.  I have a GPS and I use a Pocket PC PDA so I need Pocket Streets.

After I got home I read the fine print on the box.  It list support for no higher than the Windows XP OS.  But, so far the program is running fine on my Vista machine.

The laptop has no serial COM ports and S&T 2007 won't detect a USB port. The description of S&T 2007 which includes a GPS indicates it uses a USB port but apparently it needs the included USB adaptor.  I could not locate where I could purchase such an adapter.

S&T 2007 no longer ships with Pocket Streets.  Nor could I locate where I could download a copy.  I can (for now) use my old Pocket Streets program because 2007 does EXPORT Pocket Street maps.

Finally, within two miles of my home the map list an airport and runway that was shut down in the early 90's.  The main highway a few blocks from me has only 3 exits in 2 miles yet S&T 2007 list over a dozen intersections which means when I get directions I always end up down a dead-end road.

I've purchase many versions of Streets and Trips and this is the first time I felt I've wasted my money. Open software can't be returned from where I purchased it.  I guess I'll have to start researching other software packages.

This might be the greatest mapping program in existance, but I would never know. Very user unfriendly. There is no instruction book provided with it (or available that I can find.) The help function is very poor and doesn't provide adequate instructions. If you just need basic mapping functions save your money and use one of the free online websites

I paid top dollar for PS7 and thought it was time to upgrade to CS2.  After I installed CS2 I discovered that I could not crop any photo without having my PC crash.  Every time it crashed I looked at the defrag utility and I had fragmented files all over the place.  Then I defraged the hard drive and went back to CS2 and tried to crop the same photo again.  Again, my PC hung up and was unresponsive and the defrag utility said I had to defrag.  The only thing I did was to crop one photo in CS2, and that was enough to make it necessary to defrag again.  I uninstalled this piece of garbage from my PC.  It does not work, and I don't care what Deke McClelland says and I don't believe what he says, either. Save your money.  These rip-off artists at Adobe are nothing but thieves.  Yeah, they ripped me off for $153 but you know what?  At least I have my integrity, and that's more than you got, Deke baby.

The new  look is very nice.

BUT, when you install, you have also to keep the previous version (in well behaved software, automatically the previous version is cleaned... not here).

The system of validation of License through Internet for the physical machine is fine, I just hope that I will not have a disk crash and then waste time to be authorised to re-install a product that I rightfully paid (and at such a price).

Well, make sure you:
- do not try to de-install 5,5 after the install of CS2 (or bye-bye the license)
- have a clean and robust backup of your installation....

I am not sure I will make the next upgrade....

I should have ordered thru Amazon to avoid the confusion, since they state the vercsion needed, but where I ordered from did not mention the 5.5 version requirement, and on the box cover, THERE IS NO STIPULATION ABOUT THIS, only a generic statement that a previous version is required. How hard would it be for them to print on the box what versions will and will not work??????

Adobe Customer Service would not budge, so I am returning the product. Of course, Christmas is ruined for the person I bought this for, and I am out shipping and handling charges. Thank you Adobe. Obviously, I can't recommend anyone buy from Adobe at this point. It's easy to see why warez are popular when companies are this foolish

Although it says that this works for ALL versions of Photoshop it does not upgrade from Photoshop Elements.  I spoke with customer service and they would not give me the code to unlock it

I purchased Turbo Tax after reading the reviews here...someone had mentioned a glitch, but someone else mentioned a work around.  
Bottom line, if you can sit down with all your records and do the whole turbo tax from start to finish in one swoop,  you're fine.  
But if you need to start and stop while completing the schedule 2 business aspects of your tax return, get ready for a huge problem...it doesn't let you back in!  I went to their website where they had both a work around, and a report that if you update your turbo tax (very easy) the glitch will be fixed.  Not so, it did nothing for me.  Then I tried the workarounds...I got back in once but the next time I tried to use the work around a few days later, it did not work.
I ended up having to call an accountant 1 week before the 17th and thank goodness I was able to get an appointment.  
Also, if you have a business and don't understand some of the tax workings, like depreciation, it is very difficult to translate your former accountant's previous year's work into the new turbotax. It's not set up that way, so you need to know what you're doing.  I have a college degree and a lot of stick-to-it-ness, but I could not figure out and be sure that I was entering things correctly.  And then, it didn't matter anyway, as I couldn't get in to change anything in the end.

Finally, make sure you save, save, save as you go!  While doing my turbo tax and having spent a couple of hours already, I logged into their website to get some support.  When I "X"ed out of the internet page, it closed my turbotax screen that I'd opened on my computer.  Guess what?  It was all lost and I had to start from the beginning.  That was before I was even impacted by the "glitch" later.  This program does not remind you to save when you close, or ask you if you want to save, so be sure and save all the time!

So, good luck to anyone who tries this.  For me, it was a huge disappointment and I am returning it to Amazon for a refund due to the glitch.  I honestly don't know how they can sell something with such an obvious problem.

Turbotax is okay if you only have a 1040A to file, but anything beyond that it quickly becomes a real pain in the nether region.  Not only that, but if you have complications with trying to file, good luck.
It looks as though I will have to pay to have my estate taxes filed.  Ttax is worthless

Everything the negative reviewers say is true and MORE. Please note the following as well:
1. If you are a college student taking a class online that uses Blackboard software, Vista will prevent you from posting to the class discussion board and answering any fill-in-the-blank or discussion questions on TESTS! To fix this download the FoxFire browser (free) and use it to access your course. Because Vista uses so much memory and is already so huge, they had to drop quite a few little programs that software needs to access in the Operating system.

2. HUGE MEMORY AND HARD DRIVE DRAIN. 
Look at this comparison
Windows XP Professional    Size on drive 1.5 gig    Memory requirements 128 MB

Windows Vista    Needs 15 GIG To Load. Does not say how large the program is but I wouldn't think its small!!! Memory requirements 1 GIG!

If you check the DELL website you will see that they recommend that you have 2 gig of memory to use Windows Vista. That is a few $$$ worth of memory just to run the operating system while openning a program. Try running a game or doing animation with that kind of a sink hole in your system! The less memory you have available, the slower everything, including websites will load (no matter how fast your internet connection) 

 What is worse is that to fix what is wrong with it (ie replace all those small programs your software expects to find in the operating system), they will have to ADD patches that can only make it bigger and hungrier for memory!

This is the most pathetic excuse for an upgrade that I have ever seen. I would expect some lawsuits before this is over! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT

I wanted a new computer, so a couple months ago I ordered an HP computer that happened to have Vista on it.  I thought, "oh great, I'll get the newest OS as well"... major mistake.

1. Didn't work with my perhipherals, including my scanner and an HP PRINTER.  For god's sake, the COMPUTER'S AN HP, why won't it work with an HP printer!?  If they knew the drivers for perhipherals weren't ready, why the did they release the OS and force us to buy it?

2. Annoying security feautres, constantly asking permissions to install software.  Just like the Apple ads-- a total joke.

3. After struggling with the damn thing for 2 days, I decided to try to install old trusty xp on it... $200 later, guess what?  You CANT INSTALL an earlier operating system!  Booting from the CD doesn't work either, you get the blue screen of death.  Maybe some tech geek can do it, but I'm done wasting time with this thing.

4. All that agony, for what?  The "fancy" interface?  Who cares what it looks like, I just want to use my damn scanner!  I'm sure all those slick effects suck up RAM and resources, for what functional purpose?  Just to look more like mac?

5. ... Speaking of which, I am now switching to.  Goodbye windows, after 15 years of struggling with your crappy software, I'm done

My computer was running fine until I tried to upgrade.  First it took almost 2 hours to install at the last 3% it found a error and was going to roll back.  Well it never did.  It erased everything.  It went to a dos prompt. Called help line and it took 3 hours to just reload.  When it was done, I had no files or any of my programs on the hard drive.  Not only that but he said I had to install again to register.  It takes forever to install.  Took forever to get in touch with someone, they were in Nova Scotia, and I still do not have a working computer.  I have to try and get a recover program to get my files back.  I recommend staying away from this product for upgrades.

You can bet those people gaving Vista a good rating here, work for the company.  It's a piece of JUNK.  If you have a good working XP, or anything else, please don't buy Vista.  I bought it a month ago already installed on a good HP computer.  I've worked on it from sun-up to sun-down for a month and still, all I've got is a pile of junk.  And, it's so slow, that you have to take a coffee break while it's gathering up a program to run.  Don't buy their One-Care either.  I've owned Windows since "98".  I'm considering re-installing my old HP/XP.  It's still here in the closet

I just bought this yesterday, and though the product description here on Amazon says it's compatible with Windows 98 and Windows ME, the packaging says "TaxCut USB Drive is compatible with Windows 2000 and Windows XP."  All our taxes for several years have been done on a Windows ME computer with a USB port.  Now what?  HELP!

I always thought the laborious interviews in turbotax were pretty ridiculous, now I've seen the opposite. Taxcut online seems totally not thorough, such as just asking for total of certain things, and not asking if special circumstances apply, which you don't miss at all until you have one of them. I had almost completely finished my taxes and got to the business use of home. I moved half way through the year. I couldn't find where to add an additional home office listing. "Nope, can't do it" said support after an hour long chat session of mostly waiting, "you'll have to use another product." So today I start from scratch and pay the $99 ransom that turbotax is charging small business owners. I encourage the competition to get their shizzle together next year.

The system requirements for this product on their packaging says nothing about Mac support and requires Windows.  H&R Block didn't support Mac's last year and they've only given half-hearted support this year.  If you own a Mac then TurboTax is your best bet.

Unlike years past, H&R Block (founded by a guy named Bloch) decided to charge $16 for each e-file, Federal or state.  Only one version, "Premium Federal+State+E-file" includes a "free" Federal e-file and state e-file; but that version costs $70, so there's no free lunch at all.  Seriously, $16 is a lot to pay for e-filing.  There are websites that give you completely free e-filing; my favorite is TaxAct (at taxactonline dot com).  With TaxAct, you get the complete Federal plus state package for $7.95, which includes e-filing.  Or you can use their standard package to prepare Federal and e-file for free, with *NO* income restriction!

I don't work for any of these companies, nor any tax-related company, nor any such entity.  I just don't think it's right for H&R Block to charge customers such a ridiculously high fee for e-filing, whereas people can e-file for free elsewhere.  BTW, if you use Taxcut to prepare your return, you'll have to use H&R Block's e-filing service if you want to e-file; you can't just take your file to another website and expect that website to do it for you.  I used TaxAct in the past and they are very dependable.  You can find reviews of TaxAct products in major magazines and on major websites.

Good luck

I worked hard on a VCD project for work using Photo Explosion. I didn't think it was that easy to use, but it was okay until I got ready to burn.  Got a little error message that said something along the lines of "You don't have Nero burners!" No kidding, but there are four other burn programs on my computer. Nothing but Nero would do.  NOWHERE on the box are you informed of this.  It says, and I quote, "Burn CD slideshows you can watch on tv!" Needing more software is never mentioned. As far as I'm concerned, this product makes fraudulent claims.  I will never buy another one of their products

This software messed up my computer big time.  It does something first of all, to Microsoft word.  Word does not work properly after installation of Photo Explosion.  It then went into different areas of my computer and screwed it up.  At first I only suspected it to be Photo Explosion.  I had to have my computer sent back to HP.  When I got it back I reinstalled Photo Explosion and the same thing happenend.  BE CAREFUL.  Product has BIG PROBLEMS - WHICH WILL GIVE YOU BIGGER PROBLEMS - I GUARANTEE IT.

The editing portion of the software is completly separate from the CD portion of the software and does not store in the same file. CD's can hold upto approx 500 photos but the softwware will not accept more and allow you to discard down to burn 500. I was told by Nova Development that the merging of photo shows was not being supported by the company since the CD writer was a free add on to the program. The box and program info did not indicate that. I offered to purchase the full program but it is not available anywhere

Once again, Microsoft has proven they can churn out some new schlock overnight, filled with bugs, with limited usefulness. The greeting card section was the most amusing to me- it prints out great looking cards with upside down text beginning at the bottom of the inside of the card. In short, the cards section is buggy and you can sink hours trying to maneuver around it and look for solutions online. I make pc cards all the time and I can say this program sucks. The help section answers nothing, but MS will gadly charge you $35 per question for support. Some huge sections of MS Works is just made up of links to internet sites that one can find easily by using any search engine; I call this fatuous redundancy. The loading for some parts, like the calendar, is slow even on a very powerful computer. This is one of the most useless and shoddy programs I have ever used in my ENTIRE life. It is a waste of space on my pc and will be used rarely if at all. It's hilarious they are charging around $50 for it. This is a $9.99 bargain bin kinda thing. Don't buy it. My pc came with it and that's the ONLY reason it's there.

Having just paid [...] for this product, I expected the word processing component to have at least the basics.  Wrong. To me, the ability to easily format a business or legal document with "page x of y" at the bottom of the page seems pretty fundamental. Well, Works 8.5---unlike other Microsoft word processor versions or programs---does not provide that choice. Without this basic a "feature", you might as well simply use Wordpad. 

I cannot comment on other abilities this program has or doesn't have, or, on the spreadsheet or database modules, because I simply don't want to spend any more time on this. 

Recommendation:  Go to OpenOffice.org and get Open Office for FREE

TaxCut is easy to use but the explanations are not complete, nor written in a way that is easy for laypersons to understand.  Many terms of art are not defined at all.  

Most disturbingly, when you first sign up for the product the price is listed at $54.95 for both state and federal filing,  but after you have already done all the work and are ready to file, the only options listed at checkout time are $29.95 for federal and another $29.95 charge for the state filing.  

This bait-and-switch is apparently widespread and common for H&R Block, unfortunately.  I called and complained to customer service and they refunded me $5.  I told them that I thought it was certainly unethical and probably illegal, and they were inviting a lawsuit with this deceptive practice.  

Finally, the program crashed several times while I was using it.   Although the data was always saved, it was quite obnoxious.  I run a high-performance, well-maintained Mac PowerBook, so I'm not accustomed to having things run so poorly.  

next year I'll go with TurboTax.

I have used Taxcut and TurboTax on and off for years.  TurboTax tends to have less problems.  This year Taxcut was incredibly difficult.  First it would not properly import the data from DeductionPro.  Then the tier one tech support gave me outright incorrect information.  Finally tier two support gave me the link to the custom patch that allowed me to import the data.  Also,  when I received the Taxcut email that the IRS had accepted my return I logged on to Taxcut to check status and get my declaration control number.  Taxcut would not recognize that I had efiled and would not check for the dcn.  I had to call support for about the 5th time and after some time on the phone they discovered they could access the dcn and gave it to me over the phone.  Because of these delays I have still not finished with the state return.  I don't know if I will buy this product again.

One thing you will find reading through many reviews is a dissatisfaction with the state filings. This is my own experience and this may be the last year I use TaxCut because of it. First of all, it would not allow me to e-file my state return but didn't explain why. I later discovered that for most states you apparently can't e-file a partial year return. Then when printing out the state return it told me I had to also include a form that was mentioned nowhere else in the program. I later found out that Taxcut does not support all state tax forms! I then had to get that form and fill it in manually, and then discovered I owed less than before because Taxcut had incorrectly calculated my capital gains. AND there was nothing on the missing state form that could not have been completed with data the program already had.

TaxCut also advised me I could save $1000 off my fed bill by contributing to an IRA. So I opened and IRA and contributed $4000. When I went back to TaxCut and entered the details it told me I wasn't eligible for any tax deduction. I was ready to be tied up! This software is seriously dysfunctional.

I'm guessing by this stage you get the idea. Bottom line: I will be looking elsewhere to complete my tax returns next year.

Oh, by the way, if like me you were unable to efile and you paid for the efile option, you can get a credit from H&R by calling 1-888-4TAXCUT option 2,2,0

I am by no means a computer idiot, I audit computer systems security for a living. I have had to contact customer support (webchat) at least 3-4 times during the first 30 days of installing the software. The install was on a brand new system (Windows XP Pro), with all of the Microsoft patches and service packs and little to nothing else installed. 

First Pest Patrol would crash numerous times a day until technical support walked me through a complex workaround to prevent an Active Protection error window appearing over 100 times every 10 minutes (which you had to click to clear each one). Second, the firewall would tell me I was not authorized to visit certain webpages until technical support walked me through a complex process of deleting certain files created by the firewall and resetting the firewall after a process involving safe mode. Third, Pest Patrol never would run a thorough scan. I'd receive two separate errors that either said a fatal error occurred with the Pest Patrol GUI, or that system resources was not available. I contacted the customer support and they told me that yes, sometimes Pest Patrol doesn't work at all unless you use MSCONFIG to disable all startup services (systems.ini, etc) reboot, run Pest Patrol, then use MSCONFIG to enable the startup services. It was a canned reply during a live web session, which means that the operators were probably used to giving since it likely occurs to many people.

I haven't tried out the third solution yet because I wanted to remind myself to write an Amazon review.

If you are looking for simplicity, or don't know much about computers, look elsewhere. Otherwise you will be in for one major headache trying to implement several technically involved workarounds. I'll give it two stars, since it didn't cause my dog to choke, explode my house, or cause irreparable damage to clothing (which is my one-star).

Found the registration number difficult to read. Had to have customer service tell me that they run into this all the time! The I's look like 1's. Tried it again! I got it to load. My computer slowed down significantly! Certain sites I could not access anymore without re-configuring the software. I have used Norton. MCaffee or whatever, and other suite type security software. This one was the worst. I would not recommend it. I got a well deserved refund

I was lured to this product by a rebate which made it free. The manufacturer Computer Associates burned me for the rebate and will likely do it to you too. As for how it works no trouble installing like others have mentioned but it slows my computer to a crawl. After a while you will shut it down and then you can resume surfing the net at normal speed

This was the most user unfriendly Turbotax I have ever used.  The Schedule C imported misinformation, had to keep forcing in the correct info. And I just found out my State taxes were received showing I owed a completely different amount than what I had electronically filed.  I have used this program for years, but after this, NEVER AGAIN!!! Let this be a warning to others

I used TurboTax Premier last year & was so happy with it that I told everyone to buy it this year.  What a fool I was.  This years program was a nightmare.  I will never purchase it again.  Every time I needed to go back to check something, I had to go backwards through each page until I reached the page I wanted.  Then to go forward to where you originally were, you had to retrace all your steps a second or third or fourth time.  It got to the point I quit going back to check.  It took hours this year and I am still not confident the results were correct.  I may take it to H&R Block just to see if I need to file an amend.  Next year I will try a different product.  ---One other thing, navigating the State portion was so difficult.  There were hidden pages in something called "quick zoom" or some such thing.  I could never figure out where I was.  Thanks for the headache Turbotax

I had the exact same experience as another reviewer. ....loved it for years...changed formats...no confidence. At the last minute I had to use an accountant. The accountant cost me $650.00. $50 more than what I was over paying in taxes using this software. A disaster. It doesn't look like it was importing data correctly, state navigation really was painful. I buy this software to try different senerios (Joint or single)...but this year it wouldn't do that. Probably because they worry too much about getting paid for every user and not enough to assist people who bought the software.

To my mind the software is crippled

I have used Turbo Tax for at least past eight years and always have been very pleased with it. This year however some "genius" decided to change the entire format and approach and I found this year's version to be terrible. Very confusing now when used to be clear and simple. Hard to even download, confusing up dates, difficult to find numerous frequently used items (estimated taxes paid in previous year, capital gains/losses, state taxes paid, and more). The running total of taxes owed in upper left hand corner came out different from final taxes supposedly owed. 
   I have zero confidence in this year's program doing my taxes correctly so will have to have an accountant do return for first time in many years. Have recommended Turbo Tax to many over the years, but would strongly recommend against buying this year's product. A perfect example of how to take something good and make it lousy by messing with it. Suggest you save your money and either go to an accountant or use another firms software, this one stinks

I bought this product based on independent reviews by consumer and PC magazines.  The product's performance was OK, but customer service was a headache.  The serial number on the CD that was shipped to me came up as "invalid" when I tried to install the software.  I had to call customer service, who gave me two more serial numbers before the software would accept one as valid.  Now, one year later I want to upgrade my software to the current version (to save $$ over a new purchase) and guess what?  My serial number is invalid and in order to upgrade via the Trend site I will have to pay more than what Amazon would charge me for a brand new CD.  I will most likely switch to ZoneAlarm because of the hassles involved in registering and upgrading this product

If I could give less than 1 star for any Trend Micro product I would. It gives too many false positives when you don't even have a virus. You are going nuts trying to find where the virus is and there is not even one there as Trend told you there was. Avoid this like the plague and save your hard earned money. It's a piece of crap.

I bought this 1 week ago at a local Staples.. The box makes it sound like the solution to all your problems.. It also says they offer tech support 24 X 365.. 

Sounds great.... the problem is..it will not install on my computer. I keep getting a message to remove NORTON ANITVIRUS before I can install Panda. I removed NORTON and it no longer can be found thru control panel, remove software or thru a search of my hard drive.

PANDA still will not install. I keep getting the same message. UNINSTALL NORTON.

So I tried to contact tech support per the box. I found out they offer tech support 24 x 365 via email. I have sent 3 emails in a week and have received no response. 

Bottom line is I have a product I cannot use.. TECH SUPPORT does not exist. It deserves 0 stars in my book. Spend your money somewhere else

As a teacher I use Word, PowerPoint, and Publisher when working with students AND engaging in professional activities (presentations to organizations, etc.)  I have been using Office 2002, and thought I should upgrade.  BIG mistake.  The ribbons of icons are frustrating to scroll through, especially since I previously just customized the toolbar so everything I needed was immediately available.  I'm still trying to figure out how to type in Chinese, although the Spanish and German are working fine.  Additionally, they've come up with a truly ugly color scheme for their ribbons/icons/etc.  As a previous commenter noted, making changes to the basic template creates extreme problems, and I also was unable to get the darn number bullets to renumber.  It took me almost twice as long to write a test as usual, and I ended up doing manually what used to be done quite easily using the toolbar.

The designs in Publisher are now very difficult to see and differentiate.  In previous versions, you could see the stark differences between different designs.  In the current options pages, everything is so soft, both in line and color, as well as being so small, that it's hard to tell what you're looking at.

But the truly big disappointment is PowerPoint.  Their new selection of slide designs has all the appeal of rotting road kill--I would be embarrassed to give a presentation to a professional group using what is available in 2007.  

I have reinstalled my 2002 programs.  I feel like I just wasted all the money I spent on this suite.  My suggestion?  If you absolutely have to have a PC because you do a lot of word processing, stick with Word 2002 or 2003.  If you need to do presentations/brochures/etc. for your business, get a Mac and avoid this problem altogether

They changed everything!  In an effort to make it more user friendly, they've rearranged most of the controls.  Menus are replaced by headings.  It is difficult to accomplish what were easy changes before.  Some of this will likely improve with use.

WORD 2007 is constantly trying to think for you, auto formatting as you type.  However, it often isn't thinking what you are, and making it obey your commands is frustrated by the new headings.  Particularly frustrating, when I "right-click" on a list to restart numbering at "A" (ie. after roman numeral II on an outline), WORD 2007 flatly refuses.  My research paper is now formated:
I.   Heading
  A. subpoint
  B. subpoint
  C. subpoin
II.  Heading
  D. subpoint
  E. subpoint
  F. subpoint
III.  Heading
  G. subpoint etc....etc...
This is ridiculous and inexcusable!  I also had to individually superscript 130+ footnotes.  Somehow, in changing the font from the Widows default "Calibri" back to "Time New Roman," the footnote setting was altered and I have yet to determine how to restore it.  However, if I open a new document it is fine, but I really don't want to retype a 30+ page research paper.

POWERPOINT 2007 works well enough, compared to the older version.  They have added a few bell and whistles, but nothing that gets in the way.

If you have to buy a new computer you're likely stuck with the new MS Office 2007.  But don't buy it until you have to.  It is NOT an upgrade from the previous two versions

This is the worst thing since the Office Assistant animated paper clip.  Forcing the "ribbon" on the user assumes that the user likes icons (I don't -- what's wrong with words??), and fills too much of the screen real estate.  Nothing is where it should be.  And what arrogance on the part of Microsoft to provide no alternate views, no "classic" view, just these piles and piles of inscrutable icons.  Another oppressive, giant waste of my time and money at the hands of Microsoft.

I bought the software some months ago.  Noticed some problems with my PC in subsequent weeks. Didn't put 2 and 2 together.  Last week however, I'd come home - no icons on screen - no ability to Ctrl-Alt_Del - each day this would happen. The machine had to be powered on and off to reboot. Pulled recent software off machine. Yes - you've guessed - without Spy Sweeper I have no problems. OK - it might be a conflict with other software - a quick Google confirmed my suspicions that others have problems. I was never impressed that it was picking up anything of substance either - but then maybe my machine is clean

I made the mistake of buying a two-year subscription.  Every upgrade slows the product down.  A scan that used to take 14 minutes now takes over one hour. Stay away from this junk--there are much better free products available

I've been using SpySweeper for 2 years now.  It generally does what it is supposed to do.  However, it was nearing time for me to renew.  SpySweeper becomes a huge, irritating nag when it comes time to renew.  Not only does the software bug you all the time, but Webroot sends out reminder e-mails too.  With 3 weeks left on my subscription, I decided to renew, mostly just to get rid of all the nagging.  Well, guess what? - the renewal process reset my expiration date.  Rather than giving me 3 weeks plus 1 year, the renewal starts immediately, and ends in exactly 1 year - which means, that I've been ripped off for 3 weeks of paid subscription.  Maybe Webroot thinks their users are too stupid to notice this deceptive practice of moving up renewal dates.  I've complained to them - and if they don't make amends, then I cannot recommend this product to anyone

I work at Best Buy and we install this piece of garbage all the time.  For one its a huge system hog and two it doesn't catch much of the pesky spyware.  Also when computers come in to be cleaned up, no one uses this program (even though we're "supposed" to recommend it).  I would recommend xoft, pest patrol, or MS Antispyware much much more.

I feel duped! I bought Spy Sweeper at the computer store a year ago. It was the 2.6 version. At first everything was great. I got my definitions, it found traces, it detected spy cookies. When I ran the definition update, I had no problem with the firewall. Every time they said upgrade, I did. Then I started getting renew e-mail. I had months to go and they sent me renewal e-mails sometimes two or three a week and I ignored them, not only because I knew the year wasn't up, but I also was suspicious that it was just another spammer out to get my credit card information. I e-mailed them asking if their renew mails were really from them, voicing my concerns. I got ignored, to when I eventually got to speak to someone, they didn't even know what their renewal e-mail looked like! The problems began when I updated the latest version which is the 4.5. When I would try to update my definitions I'd get a warning that there's was a problem and contact webroot, while it had no problem noting that I had the latest version updates. No settings were changed, not even my firewall which was blamed by them. I think it's them not me since now it's suddenly happening. They refuse to address it. Then I checked their site about my subscritpion. I knew I had one because I bought it at the store, my subscription doesn't expire until June and if I was invalid I doubt I could upgrade to newer versions. What did their page say? No subscription! When I wrote I never got a straight answer about it. Then I was told that the program was corrupted, download a new copy of the latest version from their site. I did. What did I get? Boxes that said subscription not activated. They knew I had one and they won't change it on their site or give me explanations. After pestering does my latest version now say when I expire. I've asked why it goes online to scan when it doesn't need to and I get ignored. So I decided to call but wasn't sure how because I'm in a different time zone. It took several days for them to get back to me by e-mail saying that their Mountain Time is treated like my Eastern time to get a hold of someone. The first person I spoke to after four tries at 15-20 rings each, was nasty, especially when I told him to slow down because he mumbled. I downloaded what he told me to do, he said nothing about the firewall issue despite him telling me he read my tickets about it.The second person sounded like he'd smoked one too many joints after he decided to answer the phone after 15 rings. He didn't know how to answer any of my firewall questions or why their page kept saying I had no subscription when the program in it's latest version finally admitted I'm current after pestering.  They don't give you straight e-mail answers. They don't answer their phones hoping that after the 15th ring you'll give up. It won't scan everything even when no other programs are running. In the new version it found a spy cookie, it kept repeating the same one over and over despite my checking it as "always remove".Never did that with the previous versions. I don't like a company who answers questions selectively. I don't like a company who makes you wait 20 rings. I don't like a company who blames your computer settings when they never affected the previous versions. Webroot's Spy Sweeper will be replaced in my desperate search to find a spyware program that actually works, and whose staff answers my questions and not mislead me about my subscription status

I have owned Spysweeper for several years. I have found that a large amount of spyware is not getting caught.  In many cases, a  **portion** of the spyware was caught, Spy Sweeper did not remove the complete spywhere and I kept getting hits.  Tried out XoftSpy software and it found and removed ALL of the spyware.

Even more, I get constant e-mails from Webroot telling me that my "Subscription needs to be renewed."  and that I must send in another $25 to renew.  I got caught in their scam once until I started checking my subsciption date.  They frequently send out banket e-mails telling people their subscriptions are up even though they may have as much as a year left.  I have contacted them several times on this issue with no response or correction.

I am only keeping this software installed because I paid out the bucks for it.  I would not recommend it to others mainly because of the decptive business practices and the inability to perform as advertized.  Look elswhere

This is a good product but...

Unfortunately webrrot feels no need to stand by its current marketing claims of:

Free Software Updates
Spy Sweeper is continuously updated to provide you with the most advanced and effective spyware protection. As a Spy Sweeper customer, you receive these updates to our software absolutely FREE. 

This is simply not the case they have now instituted an anual subscription update fee like the big boys. When I addressed this with them on the phone they suggested I take it up with the vendor "Fry's Electronics" they should have warned you.

Our issues are concern over the future marketing claims made by this manufacturer. They will also say you should have read the small print... We guess their interpritation of free and the rest of the world's is a little different. Who knows what they will decide in the future.

We are seriously disappointed in webroot

The bottom line of what makes a company viable is great customer service after the sale when things don't go as planned. Customer Service exists but their reps claim they can't do anything about your problem. Their manners are less than acceptable. Rude seems to be the "in-thing" at this company. As consumers, we have options; one of which is to ge elsewhere. I am writing them off as a lost cause and taking my monetary loss as a lesson learned. It's too bad

I ordered ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite 2006 after a PC magazine review,   I have a 3 month old HP Media Center PC.   Th software totaly locked up my machine on install twice.   Each ocasion requireing me to reboot in safe mode and to use the restore function to even use my computer.   I lost 6 - 8 hours of work befoe I decided to return it.   I did receive my refund 8 to 10 weeks after returning the product.    I am now using Norton Internet Security with no problems.  I transfered it from an older abandoned PC.

I mave been a PC user since 82 and am fairly knowledge about hardware and software.   This is one of the few programs I could not instal.   I have used the free Zone Alarm Firewall without problems.

Don't buy Zone Alarm if you use AOL; they are not compatable.  The pop-ups will drive you crazy and AOL won't work properly.  Also plan on your computer running much slower when this software is installed.  I bought it from Amazon and had to throw it away in a month...  no refund; money lost.  Norton is far better with AOL

I had two new fully operational G5 computers with Panther operating system already factory installed.  I was contacted by Apple that a new Operating system was available, faster, yada yada yada.
I took the two computers into the store and purchased the new operating system Tiger.
The software proceeded to completely destroy both hard drives on both computers.
I returned them and told them I wanted my mony back. They refused since the software was oipened but agreed to replace the corrupted software and install it for free.
The computers never worked right since.
We were forced to continue working with these crippled computers as we have deadlines to meet.  It was a nightmare
as it took four times the normal time to do the work because of crashes etc.  We were already out a week with down time due to their negligence.
When the smoke cleared we took them back in and asked them to take the operating system Tiger out and replace the computers with the original operating system.  Another four hours standing in line.
We got them back to the office and low and behold they still did not work. We took them back again and were told by a snotty tech that we had dust in the computer as if that's what the cause has been all along. He told us never to come in with dust in the computer again even though the dust was in areas that we are not allowed into without breaking the warranty.
If this were the case why hasn't it been a problem for the past 12 years? and what am I supposed to do? only use the computer in an operating room?  The dust he displayed was extremely minimal the computer was only six months old and if it were such a problem why didn't the other four techs working on the computers notice it and clean it the first four times they had it on their bench?  
Bottom line.. I'm tired of buying new programs and computers that don't work. Tired of standing in line for hours. Tired of companies not having a complaint line. How handy is that? No wonder they keep saying your the first one that's had a problem with this.  That's literally impossible since I work in the entertainment indusrty that deals with editing and service bureaus that operate 100s of computers.  They all are avoiding Tiger because of known problems as well.  Apple is not addressing this and hundreds if not thousands of businesses are losing valuble production time due to their negligence. Instead of trying to develope a way for my daughter to dock her I-pod to a bowling ball, they should concentrate on making operating systems work in their computers.
Total time lost in our company is at least a week which is in dollars around 20,000.00. I can't imagine how much is being lost nation wide. Something needs to be done about this.  They need to be held accountable for the destruction they cause by distributing faulty product.To add salt to the wound they keep coming up with all these stupid ideas on why the computers are not running right after they destroyed them initially. There comes a time that if they can't fix them, they need to replace them and stop wasting the consumers time and costing them money.  We need a lemon law that applies to computers.  Then the manufacturers will make sure they function before they are sold. I know I can't get the money my business had lost back but I want them held accoutable for distribution of a faulty op and replace the computers they can't fix instead of sending me back to the office with inoperable computers

I've been using Apple's Macintosh systems since 1984 and have seen some great improvements in system stability, which I consider THE most important aspect of an OS.

First off Tiger is a smooth running system (when it is smoothly running), and has some of the nicest bells and whistles around. The best dog-and-pony show around. That being said, WATCH OUT!

This OS is capable of completely hosing your user settings, all your software registrations, bookmarks, email settings, etc. The whole enchilada. ANY OS that can do that at the drop of a dime isn't worth the time. Since I use Disk Warrior, Cocktail and Disk Utility regularly, this should never have happened. I waited until the OS was at the 10.4.3 stage before upgrading from 10.3.9 -- apparently it is not yet ready -- best to wait another year before upgrading. Hopefully these bugs will be fixed

It seems that all previous Quickbook versions will not run on Windows Vista and I had upgraded my system. So, I bought Simple Start as the least expensive way to get a Quickbook product to run on Vista. Turns out Simple start runs fine on Vista BUT you cannot load a company file from earlier versions. Thus, Simple Start was simply useless to me. When I called Intuit customer service they said that for another $100 they'd give me a license number that would unlock that feature. By that time I was committed and had no choice. Talk about getting ripped off!!

I read the review saying Simple Start didn't have enough features and would lead to upgrading to get a usable version. Despite the warning, I thought I could get away with Simple Start because I was buying the program for bookkeeping at a tiny church and would be putting few demands on the program. Even for my simple needs, it was a bust I had to upgrade to Pro for an additional $100. If Quicken isn't enough for your needs, get Pro.

If you are buying this product because it is the cheapest one Intuit offers, excpect to get what you pay for.  If your needs are really so simple that this product will work for you then you would be just as well off using a spreadsheet, or downloading the free version from Microsoft, or even using their home version with business added.  By the time you figure out that you need better capabilities it will be too late to return it.

Bottom line, if you want a good Quickbooks bump up to the Pro version, so you can get real Customer and Vendor management, and a decent overview summary, and multiple category levels

I have spent the better part of 4 months dealing with these guys. They won't talk to you on the phone, don't let you get support until you register your product with a serial #, which, if you lose and need to re-install, you can't get without a login and a serial #. That makes no sense.

I've had technical problems with True Image Home 9 and 10, and just can't get them to resolve it. Very unhappy with these guys. The product looks good, but if you have a glitch, prepare to wait A WEEK OR MORE for tech support to respond by email. Check out their web site and try some numbers - you'll find there's no way to talk to ANYONE unless you want to buy something.

This is not one experience with them. It's Feb 07 now, and this charade began last August! Buyer beware

If one is looking for an educational program to help a child learn there are much better programs on the market than Mia.

Unfortunately we bought this as a package of Mia and all suffer from the same issues. First, it takes 2 CDs and a game cannot be completed without switching to the 2d CD. That compounds the problem that Mia cannot be loaded on the hard drive so the game cannot be played unless the CD is loaded. Having programs that require the loading of CDs to play them is a pain in the neck because children do not handle CDs properly and an adult must change the CDs. Most programs have only one CD but this one requires two.

Mia programs are more like video games than educational software. They are comparable to video games like Spiderman and Sponge Bob which are puzzles to be solved. That is the problem with the Mia programs. The child spends an inordinate amount of time manuevering between the educational activities so that most of the time is spent manuevering and little time is spent on education. And it can be frustrating for the child, even a child that is very adept at video games. Yet because Mia is more of a video game than an educational resource, children who are video game geeks like Mia.

Mia's science is better than Mia's Math and Reading because at least a written scenario is provided which helps out. But like all the Mia programs, the program hangs at times so that the child cannot complete the game. Worse yet because the program is always active, the hibernation and suspend operations on the computer do not function so the program must be shut down should the child leave the computer.

Another problem that all the Mia programs suffer from is that the video only occupies a small part of the monitor screen so that the effects are dimished. Other educational software fill the full screen although to Mia's credit, when the user exits the program it restores the screen to its original resolution, something not all educational softwere does.

The Mia programs do have humor in them which is enertaining to children and what educational material there is, is somewhat useful.

The game is very lengthy. It takes hours to complete a mission. The oral instructions do not always match the written ones which are the correct ones, and are confusing to children. As the game progresses, lag time increases between segments

It only became clear to me how MS undermines Mac by using its software as weapon when I began using MS office for Mac. I have used Window's based Excel everyday at work for the last 20 years and I cannot figure out how to use the Mac version efficiently. It seems like an ersatz version from 15 years ago. If you want to work on PowerPoint docs at home created on your PC at work you will find the effort not worth it...the docs will never transfer formatting properly. I bought this program and almost never use it because it is just so clumsy compared to the PC version. Having said that, there is no alternative to MS office; this is the outcome of MS having monopoly power...no support and an inferior product for Mac user

I found this software very difficult to use.  It does not have any "Stop" or "Go Back" button.  The only way to exit an activity is to hit "Esc" button to exit the program and then start all over.  When starting over, there is a very lengthy annimated introduction you have to go over each time and I could not find a way to skip it

I bought two of the Mia computer games for my emotionally disturbed special ed. class. I bought it specifically for one little guy who has been in crisis since his grandmother (caregiver) passed away. The storyline of the game is that Mia has to SAVE her gravely ill grandmother. Then she gets MUGGED by a rat! I feel this is a little to noir for small children. The math game (which I am returning unopened) is about her house burning down, and if she could prevent it by going back through time. I feel like this puts a whole world of responsibility on young subjects. I am returning both games

The creators of Mia's Reading Adventure would be better engaged creating movies and not children's games. There is just way too much expository and not enough interaction to make this worth your child's effort. If you're looking to teach your pre-k/k child reading skills I'd recommend the Blue's Clues games instead. Any older children would probably get as frustrated as mine did.

I've spent all day putting together a 300 page book in Corel Draw, the file was saved several times without error, the finished piece is 2.6 GB. I exported it as a PDF that is 4.5 GB. Never any errors in Corel Draw. 

Acrobat won't open the PDF. Says it's corrupted.

Now when I open the CDR all I get is a single page, and when I right click on the file and look at the properties it says it's 0 pages.

I'm really upset, and now I've wasted an entire day with COREL's software, if the thing is just for 1 or 2 page church brochures COREL should WARN people on the package.

It looks like I'm SOL and I'm guessing Corel will never bother with a reply.

Hint: I think I'll switch to Adobe.

Sincerely,

Waitman Gobbl

I purchased this item for $10 from Comp USA.  There was a problem with some of the files so when I finished installing it, my computer was a mess.
I lost all my desk top icons and my computer was extremely slow to respond to anything else.  It took me a while to get the program removed and I eventually ended up doing a system restore.  When the screensaver came up it did look awesome.  I wish I could have used it but I am not going to try and install it again.

In wandering around the web, I find I am not the only person to experience crash after crash upon importing (from Photoshop Elements 5).  When importing, Lightroom "thinks" for a long time (that's fine, and they do warn you it can be slow), but then the program crashes before it gets even close to finishing the import.
About the rest of the program?  I don't know.  Too frustrated just trying to get it up and running.

This software does not come close to the once-upon-a =-time quality of Adobe products. it  is shot  full of bugs overall. Not only does it cause your Photoshop system to quit working, it affects your entire Mac operating System. Adobe knows this is true because they try to cover up with a several page discussion about how operating systems, not Lightroom, can cause problems. Their approach of blaming someone else is shameful. The design of the product is marginal; almost impossible to read the dark grey print on black backgrounds. It is slower than anything I have ever seen.  I could go on and on but it only raises my blood pressure . I have spent the entire weekend fixing the computer programs broken by this "half done" system.. If you buy it, you will waste a lot of time like I did. The software is going back to Amazon tomorrow morning. Amazon, shame on you for selling such a poor product.

I am rating this program just one star because I found out AFTER ordering that it is not compatible with digital voice recorders.  I did go to the nuance website before ordering.  They didn't have a little chart to tell what the difference was between preferred and standard.  Anyway, if you want naturally speaking to do transcribing, you need the Preferred version, not this one.

Dragon 9 is supposed to have Vista compatibility, via an update that you can get from Nuance. Unfortunately, the update does not work very well, especially in the area of commands. Imagine opening Outlook and giving Dragon the command for composing new mail or even checking mail, and watching it do nothing but move to another message in the inbox. Then, imagine going to the Nuance site to get support. You have to answer about a half-dozen questions and provide you key, even if you have a registered account that contains that key. Finally, you are told that support will cost you $9.95. Ten bucks to fix broken software?! It's no wonder they don't have a support forum; it would be filled with irate customers. I won't even go into the problems with getting the support person to comprehend the problem, except to say that the software did a better job of understanding me.

I've moved on to using the voice recognition in Vista which, contrary to a popular YouTube video, actually works pretty well. At least when I need help, I can get it for free

I have a 3.2 ghz, 2 GB, PC, clearly ready for Vista.  After running the compatibility wizard and uninstalling all the software that would conflict (even the optional conflicts the second time around), they told me it would install, yet, it didn't.  After an hour of installing, it tells me the installation fails and restores XP.  I realise that mine is an isolated case, but it's typical Microsoft.  If you want something that works, buy a Mac

I've been running Spyware Doctor for 4 years, and was having problems with v4 using massive amounts of memory.  So I followed advice from the PC Tools homepage and loaded v5--BIG MISTAKE!  Since installing the new version and downloading the updates (a bad experience in itself, filled with ominous error messages from Windows), I've had to reload the code, reboot numerous times, had 2 Windows crashes and if the OnGuard facility is left running Spyware Doctor consumes 98% CPU for 5 minutes on every screen scroll done reading html text on a site identified as trusted. Oh and the company quietly changed it's policy and has hijacked my credit card information in order to automatically renew registration. I won't be running any more PC Tools products

In the instruction pamphlet under Scan Tools, there is a list of what the program scans.

One of the functions is a Registry Scanner--"This is a fast scanner that analyzes the Windows Registry for traces of known malware."

The bottom line--I have an infected registry which was discovered by my antivirus program and the Spyware Doctor doesn't know it's there. I do keep Spyware Doctor up to date.

I'm still looking for an effective spyware application

Spyware Doctor was a fine malware detection product, but it is now broken. I've used various versions for quite a while (Windows 2000, Windows XP) but 5.0 is not working reliably. 

SD will not keep running on XP. The new 5.0 program unloads the OnGuard & Immunizer functions without warning on XP. The speed issue had been a problem (even with 1 GB RAM), but they seemed to have addressed that issue before 5.0.

On Vista 5.0 will not uninstall. When you attempted to uninstall, it sends you to their website telling you how great the product is. When you ask tech support for help, they suggest uninstalling using safe mode (which cannot connect to their website). 

Spyware Doctor will not uninstall using (Windows Installer CleanUp utility - MSICUU2) as there is no entry. The Vista machine hangs and stalls. 

The obnoxious redirection to the PCtools website puts this product in the spyware category. Their tech support has been very slow (during the week, during business hours for a subscribed user with multiple purchased units). 

NEXT!

I have used Spyware Doctor since version 3 -- almost three years now.  I liked the interface and simplicity -- and the power.  But as others have pointed out, including industry reviews, version 4.x was a HUGE drain on system resources.  My PC's would take anywhere from 5-9 minutes to completely boot up, with Spyware Doctor using almost 100% CPU the whole time.  Also, my computers would frequently "freeze," which turned out to be Spyware Doctor randomly zooming to 95-100% CPU for no reason at all.

But with version 5, things are so much worse.  About 3 weeks ago, my PC's lost their ability to connect to the Internet.  Browsing slowed to a crawl, with frequent timeouts and "server not found".  I spent days on the phone with my cable company, and my router's manufacturer, trying to troubleshoot.  I re-configured my entire home network over and over.  I never made the connection between the onset of problems and my updating to SD5.  It was only after finding the PCTools support forums that I realized the problem was Spyware Doctor.

I removed the program from my PC's -- and the problems were gone.  I had full Internet connection and full speed again.

Spyware Doctor 5 is causing massive problems for users.  PCTools rewrote the program from the ground up, the company says, to improve the resource drain caused by version 4.  But apparently it was rushed to market even though beta testers reported many of these same problems for weeks.

I've uninstalled this software and am basically wasting my subscription and losing money.  Other users are right -- PCTools does indeed "auto-renew" and charge your credit card without warning.  This is a huge red flag.  I lost hours, DAYS, dealing with the problems caused by this program.  Many users have had to reinstall Windows completely.

It's easy to get caught up in the hyperbole and negative reviews.  But don't just take these at face value -- read the Spyware Doctor forum at PCTools' website.  These problems are real.  And it doesn't look like they're going to be addressable anytime soon.  They've issued a couple of version updates, even removed several of the program's protection "Guards", but these haven't fixed the problems.  And they're not giving any kind of timeline or explanations to users.

My advice -- stay away for now.  But keep up with the forums at PCTools' website.  When they finally get the issues resolved, this should be a really strong spyware program.

* PCTools has also been criticized for offering a "Free spyware scan" on their website (actually a download of SD), which will find spyware on your system but refuse to remove it until you buy a subscription to Spyware Doctor.  This kind of sleazy bullying isn't normally characteristic of reputable companies -- most will give you an actual free trial with functioning software

I have been a fan of spyware doctore for some time. Spyware doctor 4.0 was an excellent product. It did it job pretty good without taking up any significant resource. But unfortunately it seems that PCTOOLS have not yet got their act together for Version 5.0. The first version I received as an upgrade was version 5.0 build 172. Problems started as soon as my machine rebooted. The Spyware doctor service for apparently no reasons hogged the system resource to an extent 95-97%. Killing that does not matter because the application restarts after 15 sec, and also that it seems to be the heart of the application. After reboot the update started running and BAM came the blue screen of death. So after a series of reboots and crashes I installed the version 5 build 176. But that too did not work, hence finally I reverted back to version 4.0 and eveythig works perfectly.Please stay away from Version 5.0 till PCTOOLS get their act together. As a reference do go through the review of CNET for this product

 I usually use Adaware to scan my computer weekly, and like others, I would like to try the trial version Spyware Doctor to scan my computer. The result was, I had more than 200 infections! I was amazed that my other virus scan programs didn't catch any of these infections, and my computer had been running properly. Of coz, I would like to remove these infections and so I paid with my creditcard and got the License No. 

After entering the License No. and Scanning, I continued to remove the infections that spyware doctor had caught. Before clickinig the remove button,I checked what I would delete and the files SEEMS OK to be deleted.  I had to restart my computer in order to complete removing the infections. I clicked YES to restart.

From then, my nightmare began, I couldn't start my computer AT ALL!!! Not even displaying the loggin window! My computer just kept restarting again and again.  After 5 times restarting automatically, I smelled something burning from my computer!!! I was so scared becoz there are some important files that i haven't backup yet! 

Endup, I reformat my computer!!! I couldn't login my old account again! Now, I have a new administrator account and lost all the softwares that i orginally have. Luckily I was able to reinstall 70% of the softwares (you gotta know the serial no. for most of the softwares are not working after reinstall, and that took me long time to find ways reinstalling them, and NOT all of them!) Some of my important files couldn't be opened again because I don't have the softwares to open them! 

I was/am still so mad about this! The spyware doctor removed my system operating files and that's why i couldn't restart my computer. Yet, i reinstalled spyware doctor again because I paid and only used it once. However, I couldn't use it after reinstalling like other softwares.  Even i followed the instruction online to reenter the licence no. that i purchased, it's just simply not working (the website said i don't have to repurchase and it should work!)

So i Paid $10 , only used the spyware doctor once, but I lost all other softwares that cost totally more than $400

The new product release is worthless - too buggy and slow to work.  The previous releases were ok - they did find some malware and removed it, without interference in our system.  However, despite the cute-sy interface, there are other software programs that provide the same (or better) anti-malware support.

Most importantly, this company has some shady business practices (like hidden yearly automatic renewal charges, installing google toolbar with download, etc) and no way to contact them directly other than their online contact form which never receives a response.  Check out the Better Business Bureau to see their "unsatisfactory" report.

I am currently disputing a charge from this company on my debit card and have had huge problems - so far I have only been able to speak with Bridget at their third-party billing company who says they are not able to provide assistance with my complaint.  There are other, more reputable companies to work with.  This type of software is not worth the hassle

This is an example of a large company pertpetrating fraud on the people who buy its products. 
I bought my son an iPod for Christmas. Unfortunately he could not use it to download from itunes on his 4 yr old Mac Powerbook computer. He needed to buy the newer (tiger) operating system. So another [...] to buy this operating system. He has been unable to install it on his Powerbook.Both of us have spent over 4 hours on the phone with Mac tech support(hah!) and have found no solution.  Finally they told us to bring it in to an Applestore (three hour drive away) which we did, only to be told that it would cost [...] for them to even  look at it.
I hope no one else has to suffer like we have just because you bought an iPod

There's a fundamental flaw in the software: it won't print a greeting card properly unless you have a borderless-capable printer.  If you print on a printer that can't do borderless printing, the front cover image on the card will be off center.  Check the FAQ section of the hallmarksoftware web site and they even admit as much.

It's a known bug, and a 'fix' has been promised since December according to the hallmarksoftware on-line forums.  Until the fix is released, if ever, avoid this program

I loved the 2006 version of this software, but when I received an email offering an "upgrade" to the 2007 version, I decided to improve what I had.  I could not be more disappointed.  The resulting product is a miserable failure and I'm amazed that some people are having good luck with it.

This version prints everything off center.  I can play with some of it to center it, but not the Hallmark logo, etc., on the back.  The result is a very unprofessional mess.  I went online to report the problem saw they have a FAQ on the issue promising that "soon" they will have a "fix" I can download.  Three months later and still no "fix".

I've written Nova 3 times, they acknowledge the problem and issue the same automated response "Keep checking for updates".  Finally, after numerous emails and phone conversations they have agreed to let me return the software to them.

When I received the 2007 edition, which in every other way was virtually identical to the 2006 version, I threw away my old software.  I'm now thinking of purchasing it again because I found this software easy to use and loved to be able to make so many changes, add photos, etc.

Maybe some of these don't have this technical problem, but just be warned

Card Studio 2007 has repeated many cards from Card Studio 2006.  I bought this new program to have more of a selection but was very disappointed.  Also is is very difficult to see the cards when they are bunched.  You have to pick a card in order to read the front.  Very time consuming

I contacted the program's customer service department when the cards in this program printed off center no matter what I did. I received an email saying that this was a known problem with the program and a fix would be available by the end of January. Mid-February I asked again about it as there had been no fix. That time they said it would be fixed by the end of February. I've used their previous programs w/out problems, just wanted more variety so added this one. Apparently not a good idea.....

I bought this for my child who uses it at school and loves it. I have a Mac Pro running the latest version of Mac OS. I installed it and it needs to run on 800x600 resolution, which is kind of silly in this day-and-age, but that works OK. What does not work is that it crashes about every 5 minutes. Pretty unworkable. Don't bother buying this for a Mac

We have Kid Pix 3 and my kids (4 & 6) played it all the time. We just "upgraded" to Kid Pix 4, and my initial experience has prompted me to write this warning.

Kid Pix 4 runs in 800x600 resolution BUT it won't force your screen resolution to match that when it runs. Kid Pix 3, of course, did. As we are using a LCD monitor with native resolution of 1280 x 1024, we obviously want to keep the desktop running in this resolution. So now we are faced with 2 options: 1) Use Kid Pix 4 with a drastically reduced window (the drawing and toolbars are in a box surrounded by a huge black screen with the file menus at the very top) or 2) adjust the resolution manually every time someone wants to run or exit the program.

I find this unacceptable. Customer support is non-existent: if you bought it retail, The Learning Company won't answer your questions and refers you to Encore's website. No patches are available and Encore has no way to actually contact them. Their FAQ simply explains how to go to your desktop and adjust your screen resolution to 800x600.

I think this huge oversight and lack of any patch to simply fix the problem speaks volumes for the quality of this release.

Boo to Encore, boo to TLC for allowing their "brand" to be junked, boo to Broderbund. Don't waste your time

This is the worst software I bought. 

First,it cost $100 and McAfee did not honor the $55 rebate because I sent the rebate form a little late. They had only 15 days to send out after purchase while compusa receipt has much longer deadline to send our rebate form. Isn't that kind of trick? 

Second and most important, it slowed down everything, not a bit but by dozens of seconds  or even more than 1 minute. 

Third,the speed is not only the problem, its wireless connection sucks to the maximum and a couple of my machines can't get online and can't connect to the network. I have 3 PCs and 1 laptop. Only two machine can get connected. It also conflicts with Belkin network card driver which has been so popular for so many years. How the hell McAfee did not know that adaptor?

Fourth, there is no manual whattsover and you have to all figure that out yourself. Given it has so much problem it's very frustrating to configure it. Sometimes the security center is downloading forever. Who the hell knows what it is doing. Sucks. 

I had spent so much time to fine tune it and it still sucks that much. I changed back to Internet Security Suite which is much better than this. Don't buy it even they give it to you free or you will break the disk.

 This software will not load properly no matter how you try. The online help is no help at all it gives you a few suggestions that all boil down to please try to re-install. Their down loadable wizard informed me after using it that I needed buy the components that didn't load but were on the disk. Try and remove the parts that do actually load and they do not uninstall properly. McAfee has a section devoted to removal of their software but so far all the suggestions have not worked. Need customer service and its $2.99 per minute from you're first call. I have never had such a horrid experience with a software from a "reputable" company in a long time. I will never buy McAfee products again.

 Downloaded the new McAfee software.  My computer is now slowed over 90% of the speed of a snail- both with AOL and Internet Explorer.  McAfee customer service is of no value whatever.  McAfee FAQ  describes a very dangerous fix which involves editing the registry file but even those instructions don't seem to work as described.     What a mistake

I bought this product because it combined a number of security elements.  It worked fine until I installed the network security feature.  We have a home network and as soon as I installed the product, the other computers were unable to access the internet.  When I tried to uninstall it, my computer lost internet access.  Even using the 26 digit key did not allow access.  Customer service was useless.  They gave me directions which involved changing the registry. Bad move.  Needless to say, I had to have a computer repair service fix the network, and I had to reformat my hard drive. McAfee assumed no responsibility for the problems it caused,  Dell was nice enought to walk me through the reformat and it wasnt even their product that caused the problems.  I would like to give this no stars

I bought this to upgrade my previous version of McAfee Total Protection. The first install was on a laptop, when it configured the wireless security it actually made changes to my WAP setup without notifying me. First of all it said that I didn't have any security set up on the wireless connection (although I have it set up with disabled SSID, MAC filtering, WPA protection...), and after it was done it had changed the setup to WEP... Also causing my other wireless PCs (that don't have McAfee) and my Xbox 360 to no longer connect to the network... So I ended up deinstalling that part. 
Second PC: regular desktop, after installing the software (only select pieces: antivirus, firewall, spamkiller, privacy service) my multimedia sharing to the Xbox 360 no longer worked. Contacting McAfee support never yielded any usable response ('reinstall' seems to be the default answer ...). Deinstalling/reinstalling didn't help, opening up the firewall didn't help, etc. etc. so I ended up reverting back to my old version of McAfee.
I consider myself a power PC user, I've set up and configured dozens of PCs over the years, built my own PC, and I can honestly say that I have never used software worse than this one. I hardly ever write reviews, but I had to write this one. Be warned! Maybe McAfee will eventually get its act together, but for me it's time to move on.
One last comment: this McAfee software (just like prior versions btw) takes up a lot of resources - several services need to run that take up a considerable amount of memory). Not good if you don't have ample memory

Until '07, if you had a McAfee suite but only wanted to use some of its components, and use other programs for other aspects of protection, that worked fine. For instance, I use Zone Alarm Pro for firewall and Spyware Doctor for spyware, and McAfee '06 just for virus. This combination has worked fine, but McAfee '07 won't install *any* of itself unless all other programs are removed. And that's a no-go for me, since some components of McAfee (esp spyware) weren't rated all that well by reviewers.

Contrary to the other review, they did ship the proper 3 user version. 

However, since installing it yesterday it is consuming 100% of my systems resources and I can not find any setting to have it stop. Evidently it does continuous deep virus scans so you might as well toss your computer in the garbage. What a mess of a product.

This has caused serious technical errors on my systems--all new laptops, desktops.  It will cause MS Word 2007 to crash and also cause a number of errors on your file system, possibly requiring you to re-install your Vista OS.

Worked well in Windows XP and Office 2003 environment, and they claim this is Vista compatible, along with Paperport 11.  

The company will not offer me a refund.  I will pursue.

Freezes IE 7 and you have to close out and restart...besides that, the other problem is slow printing because you have to use the "Print as Image" selection for anything that is scanned.  Overall it is OK, and with the vast price difference with Adobe, I can live with it.  BUT, make no mistake, this program is far inferior to the Adobe product

I deinstall the product after two weeks of use.  It did not allow me to select Adobe Reader as my default program and was not able to open many PDF documents.  If a document was opened it was often incorrectly formatted for viewing.  Also, the feature to allow editing of the documents in Word or Excel was most often non-functional

I recently upgraded to MS VISTA and MS Office 2007 and I upgraded to the VISTA version of PDF Converter Pro 4.  BIG, BIG MISTAKE!!  The program installed some sort of pdf "add-in" to MS Office that caused Excel, Word, and Outlook to CRASH.  As soon as you opened one of the programs it would give an error message and close.  It took hours on the phone with Microsoft to figure out and correct the problem (THANKS MICROSOFT!).  However, I got ZERO help from Nuance, they wanted to charge me to even REPORT a problem!  BEAWARE YOU WILL NOT GET TECHNICAL SUPPORT WITH NUANCE PRODUCTS! Before I upgraded, I used PDF Converter Pro at home whereas at work I used Adobe Pro.  There is no comparison, PDF Converter Pro while considerably cheaper, does not do near as good a job of producing pdf files. I'm still looking for something that works but is cheaper than Adobe.

I have purchased this product which I run on a Dual Core Processor under Windows XP Professional. Software is very unstable and crashes many times when I want to open a document from a URL. ScanSoft solution is that one should save the document in once PC and then open it up. This is of course unacceptable as this software should handle this and this is just a Band-Aid fix.
Customer Service is the worst I have ever experienced and NUANCE/Scansoft need to greatly improve this. I have submitted on various occasions emails which I never ever receive a response. When talking to customer service they promise they would get back to you and so far have NEVER EVER done so!!!! Extremely unreliable service. I own many of their products and will NEVER EVER purchase another one of their products.

If you are accustomed to using other versions of CorelDraw, you may not want this version. Fact is, they have made many so-called "improvements" which I find are incompatible with other software that I have used in the past. It does not convert to encapsulated postscript (eps) files properly, and will crash programs that traditionally work well with eps figures. By contrast, CorelDraw 11 worked well. Hence the "improvement" has rendered the software a nuisance. If you are accustomed to pasting figures into other software, forget it. CorelDraw X3 will not retain the integrity of the original figure, and it will look distorted and crummy. Any prior version of CorelDraw worked well. Again, the "improvement" has made the software a nuisance. On top of that, it crashes a lot. 

I contacted their "customer service" about a year ago when I first discovered these differences. I was assured that they knew about the problems and were working on them. Well, a year later, with no patches to correct these differences, I am now being told that it is everyone else's fault (software manufacturers) that CorelDraw is not compatible. I was also told that they have no intention to correct these problems because they do not consider them problems. There is an example of their customer service for you. 

I have been using CorelDraw for a long time, starting with 6, then 9, then 11. This is the worst of the bunch by far. I am going back to a previous version.

I'm in awe about what this program can do, but I've yet to be able to use it to its fullest. It's not user friendly and I've been designing photo brochures, and marketing literature and multi-media presentations for years with other design software.

The Corel_Tutor is unwieldy to use and only illustrates the simplest projects. It takes a week to learn the glossary used for the program. And if you don't use it daily, it's easy to forget the glossary and toolbox icons.

I was hoping the "student & teacher" edition would be more instructive, but it's not.

I'm currently searching for a tutor who will teach me the complexities of using this program with a hands-on approach

I used this software to do a scrapbook for my mother for her birthday. 
First of all the software takes up a HUGE amount of space! Like 1600MB. The program is so slow and I have a relatively new computer. After about 4 pages in one file it becomes impossible to work with and then crashes. I had two files - 6 pages - crash and the work was gone. All the work gone. The text editor will add typos and put in and take out spaces. Sometimes it works great other times you have to restart your computer. Once it added bright green lines where I had added all of the embellishments to the page - everything other than the background. I had to redo it. Piece of JUNK! but what does print on a color laser - don't try it with inkjet - looks great

Be careful with this program.  My wife bought it, and I tried to install it for her on our PC.  I made several attempts, and each time installation hung at a different stage of the installation procedure.  When installation hung, I could not cancel or kill it, or even shut down the PC without pressing the Reset button (on Windows XP Pro).

I went to the support page of the web site, and found a FAQ item about incompatibility with Zone Alarm.  If you're not familiar with Zone Alarm, it is a personal firewall and security product that is very common among home users.  According to Nova Development, the only way to get Scrapbook Factory Deluxe 3.0 to install is to permanently remove Zone Alarm.  Besides being a serious security risk, this is an extreme measure to have to take.  This seems to be perfectly OK with Nova Development.  They offer no workaround other than removing Zone Alarm from the PC.  Personally, this would be enough to give me pause about installing the product even if I did not use Zone Alarm.  You have to wonder what the installer is trying to do that even the presence of dormant security software interferes with it.

This software was rated the best out of a large group of digital scrapbook programs. I am very disappointed with it. First of all, my system resources can't handle moving the pictures so while I click and drag, the screen doesn't keep up and I have no idea where the picture or item will end up. It's not very precise this way. The website's solution is to use my arrow keys. Ok, so maybe that's a problem with my computer. Second, I can't select photos easily because it brings up images that are too small to see the detail. And that's with the LARGE thumbnails. So in a photo of a group of 12 kids, I have to have the photo pre-selected. Not how I planned on putting together a scrapbook when I have thousands of photos to look through. Also, in researching the screen freeze issue I discovered that I can only have up to 10 pages in a scrapbook. Also not my part of my original plan. My advice would be to go to the designers website and look at the FAQ's before buying. It helps you to see any issues before you buy. I'm not sure what my next selection will be, but I don't see me using this for my scrapbooks.

I switched to Tax Cut years ago after Turbotax (in 2003) implemented their idiotic validation scheme. I figured I was doing my part to punish Intuit / Turbotax. And for all those years I've been happy with Tax Cut.

Not this year. I found some major bugs which cost me a lot of time. I had my return done, but the numbers were seriously out of whack -- I know I didn't have that much income! Going back through the interview process didn't turn up the source of the added money. Only by checking the actual "Forms" did I find that several copies of 1099-Misc forms were hidden from the interview process, and by adding the same data in non-hidden copies, I was double entering the data. There was no easy way to recover. I eventually had to wipe the installation and start all over. 

A call to tech support did absolutely no good. The person on the other end didn't seem to understand the problem with having "hidden" copies of forms going into the calculations. If those are hidden, what else is it doing wrong? 

I'm not quite sure how do deal with this next year. Go back to Turbotax? Hope Tax Cut fixes its problems? Or go to a human tax preparer? 

Whatver my choice, I'm not looking forward to it.

I bought Taxcut this year because it was inexpensive and included business tax forms for my partnership. For the money I guess I'm satisfied with the partnership results, but that's where it ends.

Taxcut for Federal taxes is not integrated with Taxcut for business... ok so what do you want for cheap. But, it also isn't well integrated with the Massachusetts state tax version, leaving me to go figure how to deal with what it calls "special" situations (unreimbursed partner expenses and interest from out of state banks, for example). Overriding form data is painful and the program complains that if I override calculated data I can not e-file (not that I would trust it to e-file my taxes). Form navigation is hopeless. I can only imagine what someone who isn't experienced with tax preparation could accomplish with this mess.

I filed for an extension; now I'm probably going to buy Turbotax to do the actual federal and state returns.

With a deep discount, I would probably purchase Taxcut again for the partnership taxes, because it is slightly easier to use than the Excel spreadsheets I'd been using (but only because I don't have to copy the numbers from the spreadsheets into the forms).

Honestly, you would think there would be some tax software that is better than the non-functional Taxcut without the overblown, fatty and expensive too-many-talking-heads Turbotax alternative

I tried to use this program to file a very simple return, and it calculated that I owed the state $550 for underpayment, as well as a $230 penalty for late payment.
I tried working through the program several times to find the error. I found that the program was automatically checking boxes that I hadn't checked! I have no idea if that was the cause of the underpayment problem, which I was not able to resolve.
In frustration, I went to [...] and filed my return easily within an hour, with a $140 return from the state rather than a $780 penalty

This program sucks. I used it last year and thought that it was unwieldy and really confusing (i.e. unlike TurboTax and other programs, there's very little transparency in the system). Then I bought it again this year because the store that I went to was out of Turbotax, and I needed to get my taxes done quickly. This year was even worse than last year - not only was it still unwieldy and irritating, but it gave me figures that simply did not make sense.  The results for the federal return were OK, but it gave me figures that would have cost me over $2,000 in taxes that I did NOT owe on my state return. I ended up going online to double check my results using a cheap ($10) online service recommended by the NY state tax website. Within 45 minutes, I cleared the online source, and got results that made far more sense. I have no idea what happened with TaxCut, but I suspect that they may have been missing a field somewhere along the line - this is a problem that has been noted by a number of others in reviews on a variety of sites. I will NOT be buying this product again

It is probably too late to save anyone from this software but I had to say something about it to someone. There is apparently no way to tell taxcut about it. 
I have been using taxcut for several years now after switching from turbotax because of the issue of them installing spyware. I was happy with taxcut until this year. It is defective. I can't even believe it isn't in the news. My taxcut program is missing the "wages" entry on the Schedule C form. It would have been a terrible loss if I had not caught it. I went to their website to get some help or a phone number and neither was available. I can't believe that I have the only taxcut software that is defective but I couldn't find any reference to this problem anywhere. Now I have to go through the whole tax form to make sure it didn't make any other mistakes! I might as well have done my taxes the old fashioned way by hand.

"Genius" is an educational simulation game, where you're building an industrial complex -- plop down factories, roads, houses, fire departments and such.  As the game progresses, you complete physics puzzles to obtain new technologies and product improvements.  You subscribe to newspapers, which contain answers to some questions and the knowledge or equations needed to solve others.  

The physics problems are entertaining, well designed, well documented, implemented excellently, and can be quite fun.  They are presented as problems you encounter during business operation, for example while developing a new product.  All of the information you need is provided.  The game will appeal to children 8 & up, but these physics problems are more like age 16 & up because they require high school math.  So, children & youths may need help from a parent who remembers algebra and preferably physics -- yikes!  Some of the questions are easy & fun.  Some require you to be comfortable with algebra, converting between units, and applying formulae.  A few are very difficult.  Fortunately, the questions are the same each time, so after figuring out the answers, you can write them down & just enter the answers next time.  Sometimes the game even gives you the correct answer after it is too late, so you can write it down for next time.  Unfortunately, I can't find a cheat sheet list of answers on the web -- too bad, this would really help.  The level of difficulty of these questions isn't a problem, just be warned.

The simulation side of the game is suffers in comparison.  The industrial simulation controls are poorly documented.  What each building does and when/why/where it is appropriate/inappropriate and how to run the game is somewhat of a mystery.  There's no way to figure out whether building something will be good or bad except trial and error -- logic doesn't always help.  Bad decisions spiral out of control, seem to lead inevitably to bankruptcy.  Unfortunately, wrong answers on the physics problems can have the same effect.  There is a "statistics" report that is supposed to give feedback on whether your company is making or loosing money, but this form doesn't have enough information.

So, expect some trial & error, some frustration, some algebra, some physics, & some reading through magazines looking for obscure clues.  "Genius" can be really fun, but could use some interface improvements.  Highly recommended for anyone taking physics in high school or college.

OK, the maps are good, but its very very combersome to use with a laptop in your car. It is very disracting and can easily cause an accident. Does not work aroung Lincoln tunnel area. Also would not find my home street, and I have been there for 2 years. Either the one I got was defected, or its not what other make it out to be. I had to return mine.

This is a complete joke.  The only cities that are in the program for U.S. states are major metro areas. If you have a handheld (either regular or mobile phone) you more than likely also have WiFi or GPRS internet connection.  And if you are in a major metro area, with a WiFi connection, why would you need a program for maps?  Just go to Yahoo Maps or Mapquest.  If you don't have a WiFi, then just buy a paper map...it will do the same thing (maybe even more!) than this program.

The only possible way this program could be useful is if you already have a handheld GPS receiver AND you never find yourself outside major metropolitan cities.  I have a GPS receiver for my laptop (USB) which I though could connect to my handheld and it won't...so my advice is to buy an entire package (software and handheld-specific GPS receiver).

Can't believe Microsoft put its name on this junk

I purchased this program recently, and was very disappointed.  The maps are very limited...for example, most of the major tourist areas (beaches, Newport, ect.) in Rhode Island are cut out of the RI map.  I recommend buying MS Streets and Trips 2005 (which includes Pocket Streets 2005 in the box) instead:
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0002DOEAM/qid=1121691049/sr=8-2/ref=pd_bbs_2/103-6971135-7476654?v=glance&s=pc&n=507846

With this program, you have the entire USA at your disposal, and you can select which maps to send to your pocket pc or smartphone.

Fortunatly, the store that sold me Pocket Streets allowed me to exchange it for Streets and Trips (after paying the difference).  The prices are very close.

This app is just horrendous. It is literally NOTHING more than a moving map; I'm serious. There are NO features at all. To make things worse, when zoomed out, the display is littered with the names of every little village and hamlet you've never heard of, leaving the names of recognizable towns a cities nowhere to be found. Also, at these zoom levels, most roads, streets and highways are not visible, making navigation impossible. This app does not even come close to qualifying as a GPS nav system. Even as a 'moving map' it's pretty well useless unless you're zoomed into about 300 yards. Even though this app was a freebie included with Trips and Streets 2005 (which is a VERY nice, capable app.), it's still maddening that Microsoft would allow such a eggregiously lame program to be released. If it were possible to give this program negative stars AND charge Microsoft with a crime, I'd do it in a heartbeat

I have been a loyal fan of Quicken for many years.  My, things have changed for the worst at the once mighty Intuit.  It pains me to report that Quicken Deluxe 2007 is a work in progress.


1. The installation CD was unreadable.  To Intuit's credit, I was given access to their download site for replacement software.

2. The reconciliation report (needed for balancing your checkbook) will not display or print for some reason.  All other reports display and print just fine.  Unfortunately, the reconciliation report is the only one I am truely interested in printing.  I am using a Brother HL-5280DW laser printer.  The printer works fine with all other programs, including the old version of Quicken.  Again, the most important report (reconciliation) will not print on Quicken Deluxe 2007.

3.  The software would not recognize the C-drive as a working drive even though the program is running on that drive (?) - go figure.

4.  The overseas Tech Support is willing to play dumb and pretend they don't know there is a problem with the software, keeping you in the chat room for hours.  I guess as long as they get paid it doesn't matter whether they help or not.  The ultimate recommendation is to reload the software - just one more time.

As a past happy user of Quicken 2004, I was forced into this upgrade.
Don't expect the problems to be resolved quickly.  Intuit has been aware of most of these problems for over 6 months.

I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but this version of quicken is just that BAD NEWS

I've been a user of quicken for at least ten years. I've liked the product historically, but this version is garbage. Like other users, I too have fallen victim to the 'out of memory' error. Guess what? There's nothing I can do. I can't go back to a previous version of Quicken, because my data file isn't compatable. 

Honestly, I blame myself for not reading the feedback others had left first. I was brand loyal to Intuit, but now I'm paying the price. The software is garbage, stay away.

Background - senior IT professional.  I have been a Quicken user for well over a decade and have always been very happy with the product until the 2007 version.  First, let me point out a couple of things to like about this version:

- the interface; seems to depend on the eye of the beholder, but I for one find it pleasing and useful.
- the ability to append notes and check images to a transaction.  I love this feature.
- the Cash Flow dashboard and the Calendar

Now for the caveat: if you depend a great deal on downloading transactions using WebConnect, prepare for a great deal of frustration and disappointment.  This feature used to work reliably in all other versions.  In version 2007 it is prone to quit with a notice that there has been a "Quicken Server Outage" that prevented the download from succeeding.  These occurrences are sporadic.
Scores of users are reporting this on the support forums and elsewhere; I have seen no hint of a response or explanation from Intuit.  Horror stories about tech support at Intuit have kept me away from that venue, though at some point I'll call just to see what happens.  I upgraded to 2007 from a very solid and dependable Quicken 2006, and this issue alone has made me wish that I hadn't.
Weighing the new features against the new bugs I would have to say that I do not recommend purchasing this version at this time

This is the first review I have written in probably a few years.  Normally, I don't feel strongly enough about any product, good or bad, to bother entering a review.  With this new version of Quicken, I have something that I feel strongly enough to write about.

I have been using Quicken for close to 20 years.  I have built all of my finances around it.  For the past 6 years, Quicken has been going steadily downhill.  This latest version, I hope, represents rock bottom.  I don't see how the product could possibly get any worse.

Words cannot describe how bad this product is.  No functionality has been added in the previous 6 years.  What has happened is that the screen has become more cluttered with more links to Quicken's "financial partners", and more redundant links to other, old, program features, and more white space.  In return, the user has to page through tab after tab after tab to view the same information that previously fit on only 1 screen.  Further, each screen refresh now takes seconds, whereas in older versions a screen refresh was instantaneous.

Entering a simple transaction may require this bloated sofware to generate 2, 3, even 4 complete screen refreshes, each one taking maybe 1 to 2 seconds.  That means, once you hit the "enter" key to complete a transaction, you can be waiting as long as 8 seconds before you can move on to entering the next transaction.  As little as 3 years ago the same step required less than a second.  Obviously, time required will vary with your computer - but it is bad enough that Quicken now requires you to "downgrade" your Quicken software every few years - it is also necessary for you to replace your entire computer system at the same time just so you can realize the same performance level as you had in the previous version.  All of this with NO additional features or functionality.

There is a new kid on the block that I am switching to.  It is called "Moneydance".  It can import data from Quicken, it is fast, compact, and runs on any platform, Windows, Linix, Unix, Mac, even OS/2.  It is easier to use than Quicken and the support is great.  It is available for download - a functional evaluation version is free and the full version is only $30.  You can actually speak to a person to get help w/out having to pay.  Since I have been using Quicken for years, it will take a while to test Mondeydance out to make sure it works properly.  I am running the 2 side-by-side for a while to make sure the numbers agree.  So far, things are going well.  Then I plan to dump Quicken forever.  The well has run dry at Quicken; everyone who made the product great has apparently left the company.

Obviously the people at Quicken are free to make their product as bloated and as cumbersome as they want.  But they should not be allowed to force people to downgrade.  Yet, that is what they are doing.  I am absolutely positively through with Quicken, and I am not coming back

This is an extremely flawed software program. I have used Quicken for more than a decade, and this product is not worthy of the name. Runtime errors keep me from evening getting the program going. It contains 6 bank accounts which I cannot currently print checks from. I have reinstalled the software at least 15 times with no success. I have used every suggestion from tech support and the Quicken forums without ANY success. I guess I'll have to move to MS Money

Looks nice... but beware!

Installed Norton 360 on the 6 workstations in our small office.  As soon as I did that our accounting system (Peachtree) started to lock up a few times a day.  Even after turing off the firewall on all workstations the accounting system still locked up.

I've now uninstalled Norton 360 on the server PC and that seems to have solved the problem.

I wish now that I had just upgraded from Norton Internet Security 2005 to 2007...  Never again.

Installed great - looked good. Day 3 it started blocking me from websites 'as their security certificate had been revoked' - Amazon even? After a week of back and forth 'support' they couldn't fix it and left me with a partially working PC to drown.  THe PC support is partially automated as they didn't read my responses and their advice went in circles.  Plus trying to fully uninstall it is a nightmare.

It might work on XP but don't get it if you have Vista.

Having had Norton products installed for years including AntiVirus, Internet Security, and SystemWorks, I decided to replace the installed products with Norton 360 and a non-Norton password manager.  Obviously, it is critical to FIRST remove all Norton programs before installing Norton 360.  The installation process proceeded relatively smoothly.

My computing environment includes a 1.6Ghz processor, 1,000MB of memory, and 6GB of available disk.  

The background scans and LiveUpdate have played havoc with my other applications by periodically locking up the entire CPU at 100% CPU utilization.  One application that streams radio broadcasts now stops.  I immediately disabled the automatic updates and scheduled backups, however, the CPU occasionally still locks.  

Additionally, there is no way to transfer security settings from previous Norton products to Norton 360 thereby making the installation process very labor intensive.

If you now have separate Norton security products and are satisfied with them, save your money and renew the Norton subscriptions.

As an IT professional I would strongly recommend against installing Norton 360 on your computer.  I have been a big fan of Norton Security for years and I have it installed on all my home computers for years.  After installing Norton 360, it erased most of my security settings and my computer continiusly crashed.  It messed up on of my home computers to the point that not only it would crash several times a day, but I couldn't even use System Restore to recover my computer and I was forced to rebuild the system from scratch.

Don't believe the promise to install it easily on 3 computers either.  Symantec makes as difficult as possible for you to download the software and isntall it.

I am ready to switch to McAfee

My subscription for 2006 was up and I needed to renew - since I just reinstalled Windows XP Professional (SP2) on my laptop (a Dell Inspiron 9300, Intel Pentium M 2GHz, 512MB RAM, 60GB Hard Disk), I decided to simply purchase the 360.

I have been having issues with the Live Update for several weeks now (Error 5).  Instead I have to download a 15 MB file ever so often with the updated definitions.

After checking the technical support website, it appears that Norton is aware of the problem and is currently working on it.  That was just about two weeks ago.  Customer support is non-existent it appears since I have yet to be contacted.

Complete waste of time.  Renew your existing subscriptions instead.  I wish that I had

This version does not have voice prompts to tell you directions or some of the other features you might expect. Microsoft now provides voice messages in version 2006 and it is cheaper than this version ($59-79 depending upon timing). It is worth the price if you have a laptop. Pocket Streets is disappointing. By the way, it is illegal to have your laptop open in the front seat in some states so don't get a ticket (they allow a normal GPS but not a laptop serving as a GPS...go figure).  By the way, Microsoft does not give a discount to upgrade from version 2005 to 2006 so your only choice is to purchase a new product at full price

The video editing part of this software is completely useless.  It didn't come with a manual and I ended up buying on my own a book about how to use it.  It hasn't made a difference.  The software is completely uncooperative.  My computer more than meets the minimum requirements for running the program.  If you bought this software for the video editing, I recommend using the disc as a drinks coaster and buying something else

The video-editing component of this package, Video Wave, worked great for me for about a year, but it has recently turned into a NIGHTMARE!  The audio is anywhere between 2 and 4 seconds out of sync with the video, and after trying everything I'm convinced that its a problem with the code.  A quick product search will show others who have had similar problems.  I would STAY AWAY

That's exactly where my CD went. In the garbage. That's where all the other Roxio software I've ever owned has ended up. At least I never had to spend extra for their junk.

It's always came as  part of a peripheral or PC software package. 

No printed manuals are ever provided and it's always an issue trying to download one from the Roxio website...which I would then have to print at my expense.

I could live with the on-screen manual if the software wasn't buggy and they provided some sort of customer support. 

I can't believe that this company is still in business. I guess that they survive by making deals with peripheral and PC manufacturers to stick their customers with inferior software.

Be advised......don't be fooled by their slick packaging and website. Read the reviews here and elsewhere

The video editing capability is tough to deal with and not impressive when you figure it out. The tools are not explained and there isn't as much to do with it as they imply. May be nice for birthday party editing, i don't know. I didn't like it. It's not worth $100. The other capabilities might be nice,but from what i've dealt with, that's not the case

I was extremely disappointed in this "upgrade".  I had Roxio's Easy CD Creator 5 and loved it.  That product allowed you to easily arrange your music on the dics, burn it, then create a lable or insert for the disc with almost no effort.  Almost everything was intuitive.

Creator 7 is a big step back in ease of use and utility.  So they added a few new bells and whistles, so what?  The base use of this product is to make music cd's and to create inserts.  Arranging music is not as easy as it was before.  And the insert creator is so frustrating to use I don't bother.

In fact, I have continued to use Creator 5 and have simply written off the fact I paid $100 for Creator 7 - for nothing!

Now, with a computer upgrade, Creator 5 no longer works.  I don't dare try another Roxio product (just read the reviews for 7.5 and that appears to be a total waste of money).  I'll be taking my chances on ANYTHING else . . . not Roxio

Once I figured this software out, I was able to do a slideshow of my pictures, integrate video, and produce a decent DVD.  Only problem is, it distorts all my video footage by forcing it into 4:3 whereas my DVD camcorder shoots in 16:9.  This sucks.  I have been buying other software packages ever since trying to get my video to stay in 16:9.  Roxio support did e-mail me back with the blanket statement that it doesn't support 16:9 at this time.  Even in the new 7.5 version.  Roxio needs to join the rest of us in 2005 and bring their software to be compatible in widescreen

I foolishly purchased 7.0.  It worked ok for a few months then just kept hanging up my system.  Funny, it started hanging up when 7.5 was released.  I tried to get "customer support" but that's a joke.  Do yourself a favor, DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM ROXIO.  I'd given this software negative stars if I could.  Spend your money elsewhere.

The game disk does not run on my laptop. But it will play it on my desktop computer.  Very annoying, but at least I can play (other reviewers have not been so lucky).

The game has some good questions and I enjoy testing my Friends knowledge.  The game itself is rather simple and not totally fun.  The "game board" is the outside of the Friends' apartment building.  When you get a question right a window lights up.  When you get one wrong a window dims.  If you don't answer the question nothing happens.  You win when all the windows on that floor are lit up.  I would prefer that they make you answer all questions- none of this passing on a question- it would up the ante and perhaps add some excitement.

If you play a multi-player game you cannot select which letter is your buzzer and the letters assigned by the game designers are adjacent keys on the keyboard!  It's silly for the two players to be huddled together, hovering over the same part of the keyboard when the designers could have selected other letter keys set further apart.

There are SOME video clips and still images accompanying the questions, but it's mostly a trivia game without visual aids or embellishments.  Think Trivial Pursuit with a computer screen as the cards.

This game was a gift.  If I had to do it over again I'd probably spend my money instead on Scene It! Friends Edition.  As of right now, Scene It! Friends Edition is on sale at Circuit City for the same price as this game is on Amazon. (And though I haven't played it, the reviews of that game are much better than this one).

I changed from quicken to Quickbooks and regret it.  Yes, Quick Books does some wonderful reports and invoiceing but I have found it difficut to use and especially to download crdit card transactions from my business credit cards.  I have also found it difficut to match transactions.   To get a better handle on my expenses I am going back to quicken or try another program.   Online help and tutorials, "dummies guide.... not helpful either.

You would think see they make quicken they would allow import of QIF files.
dissapointed.

I have had to un-install and reinstall three times and it still won't update on a very current Windows XP version. I hate how hard it is to download from my bank and it never recognizes the stuff anyway so I have to go through line by line and create aliases. I like Quicken better but the accountant can't figure out how to import Quicken into his Quickbooks Pro so here it is. Hate it, hard as ever not easier, the whole thing takes way too long to work with. Reports are a bit easier which is good or I would have tossed it out the window and bought Microsoft Money

The product is great, calling tech support is a task though. Intuit outsources thier call centers overseas and it is difficult to communicate with thier support people by telephone. If this product wasn't preffered by my CPA I would never buy it ever again. Boycott companies that outsource to other countries, keep our jobs at home!

I was very happy with my QuickBooks Basics. But for whatever corporate reason they no longer support the Basics version, so I was forced to upgrade to Pro 2007. It is MUCH slower than Basics, it's more complicated to back-up (it asks SO MANY questions), also it takes longer to print a simple check (again TOO MANY CLICKS before it prints...

I'd give this product zero stars if I could.  

I use the QuickBooks online payment service with version 2004, and last week it started telling me that they were discontinuing support for version 2004 with that online service, so they forced me to upgrade.

So I bought the upgrade, and when I ran the installer it wouldn't accept my serial number.  I spent forty minutes on the phone with tech support on a choppy line to India, and he still couldn't get it to work.  I finally gave up when the next step he proposed was to disable all of the services running on my computer.

I had heard from others, including an accountant, that this version was bad but couldn't believe it would really be this bad.  I'd used QB since the early-1990s and never really had a problem.  But this is really, really bad.

Intuit needs to go back to the drawing board with this version.  It's a TOTAL LEMON

I installed quickbooks pro 2003 on my new computer running VISTA and had a small problem.  So, I bought an upgrade to 2007 since Intuit says it works with VISTA.  

It does not.  The software crashes at odd times.  It also crashes when attempting to call up invoices from the accounts receivable report.  It reports out of memory errors and closes two to six times each day.  I have set up my old computer, which runs XP, so I can use the new software until they fix all of the glitches in the 2007 version.  I recommend NOT buying this version if you are running VISTA OS

I have gone through all the major revisions of PaperPort, and I dislike them all.  The features have improved, but the program has become steadily more unreliable and bug-prone.  It often crashes, which means I have to shut down the entire program when editing a document and restart, which apart from taking ages, loses all the changes I made.   Very frustrating.  It has also become steadily slower as the version numbers have climbed - you just to sit around twiddling your thumbs waiting for it to load a document or advance a page on a scanned document, especially if it contains many pages.  If you can find an alternative, don't buy it - unfortunately for me, I can's see any alternative if you want to manage scanned pdf files in a sophisticated way.

Incidentally, this product seems living proof of the dangers of bloatware - it's pretty clear that the programmers have lost control of the software's innnards.

Plus, by the way, support for this product is a scandal - $9.95 for each email sent?  Unbelievable

Contrary to the advertising about runs on vista, what comes in the box may not run on vista. Upgrade now says you are up to date but it is not., However, you can use product id to download the real vista version. BEWARE the product license says "The software...is provided on as as is basis without warranty of any kind..."I had a major mess with Nuance's product verification process. When the product did start to run, it was not correct. To date I've been charged for two support incidents(maybe more billing will hit my credit card later) and I've logged 3 hours on the phone within the first two weeks as well as several emails. Otherwise I like the product but one should not have to have hours of grief and pay and pay to get it running the first time. I'll never by another nuance product.

No Support. You have to pay $9.95 to send an email support question. Still cannot print annotations in PDF files that you create. There is a workaround. Nuance should change their name to Nuisance. I hope that someone comes up with an alternative

I have been using Paperport since it came from my visioneer scanner for about 9/10 years and since then upgraded a few versions. After reading hyped-up product features of version 11 from Nuance website, I cannot justify upgrading my paperport software to PRO given its  current cost. I am pretty sure that a lot more people (especially loyal users like me) would snap it up if it was little cheaper. I will probably wait for some time for price to go down.... It will also need time to stabilize ( no patches yet !!!) and become compatible with Vista. For those of you who got lotsa money (please send me some), I would recommend Paperport as a decent doc managment s/w

I have been a user of PaperPort since version 9, skipped the upgrade to 10 because of bad reviews, received an upgrade notice in the mail, so I decided to buy it. It turns out it was a bad decision. The scanner that I use with 11 is the same as with 9 and is on Nuance's hardware compatibility list. The problem is, it took me uninstalling and reinstalling the program to get the scanner to work at all with PaperPort. Then, when I did get it installed - and I used the advanced setup option with it, tested it, all looked good - except everytime I scan something, the program crashes! It is literally unusable as a scanning solution.

I have seen a few companies with products that were once really good, sell it off to another company, and the product support seems to be essentially abandoned. It seems that this may be the case. There are no updates or bug fixes for 11, and I will not buy another PaperPort version in the future. I will attempt to go back to 9, and probably stay with that. If I run into any issues with it over time, I will look elsewhere, and I recommend others do the same. I normally don't write reviews for products, but this one is so poor, I just had to warn people

  I've used PaperPort for years mostly because it was the best of a bunch of poor options. However, Version 11 is buggier than earlier versions: every time I launch a Microsoft Office product, the PaperPort installer starts up.

  There is no reference to this in the PaperPort Help file or in the ridiculously inadequate knowledgebase on the PaperPort site. Another bug imprints a "trial copy" legend on your PDF files. This one is explained in the knowledgebase, but requires you to tinker with the Registry to correct it. That's a bit ridiculous. Why are they distributing code with a known bug?

  Nuance expects you to pay $9.95 for e-mail technical support - even if it's a bug in their own product.

  The product is a modest performer at best, but Nuance's awful technical support policies are the real sinker here.

  I've requested an RMA for a refund.

I used version 8 of this product and decided to upgrade even though all the reviews here warned against it.  Boy are they right.  This thing is terrible.

After installing on Windows XP SP2, as soon as I started the program it crashed.  Now every time I try to scan using my Canon Scanner, it crashes every time.

Product is useless.  Wish I had of never bought it!

DO NOT BUY!

After having used this product since version 4, each version had its problems.  The latest version 11 has improved document indexing and searching - a LITTLE bit - over version 10.  It does NOT scan both sides of pages as it did in version 10.  The "Capture Assistant" crashes the program.  If you need support due to bugs in the program, you have to pay, and pay, and pay

I bought it, installed it, tried it, uninstalled it and returned it (of course I had to reformat my computer to get things back to the way I like them). Reviews say it was a big improvement.  Maybe so, but I have no desire to learn a whole new way of doing things again. I spent years learning keyboard short cuts and putting up with a product I thought was inferior to WordPerfect (how I would love to have the reveal codes option for formatting).

Be prepared for a steep learning curve. If you use word a lot and are proficient, you will find it very frustrating. Menus are different, key combinations are not all the same. You can customize it, but to be honest, I don't care. 

Between Vista and Office 2007, I think Microsoft has finally screwed the pooch. I'll stick with the old versions (XP and Office 2003) for now. My next computer will be a Mac running OS X and some sort of open office application. I have had enough.

This review is for Turbo Tax Basic for Mac/PC 2005
The software is easy enough to use but either out of curiosity or self abuse, I checked the results manually and found a round off flaw contained in the program.  If you are self employed and use Form SE (Self Employment Tax Form) the program fails to round "up" correctly.  The mistake favors the individual and not the Feds.  This is a math error and the IRS can red flag it. 
 
I remember several years ago I purchased the Deluxe or Premire verson and the program recommended that I might consider putting $300 into my IRA in order to lower my tax bracket, it was great!  However subsquent versions did not do this, after which I only purchase the Basic version.

As another reviewer says:

"But the final tax forms I needed to file with were not included on the CD-ROM package. TurboTax instructed me to get them by using "one-click update." Well after I update and attempt to restart the software, TurboTax refuses to come up at all."

Exactly. I've re-installed it over and over and the same thing happens. I've used Turbotax in previous years and never had a problem like this. After spending hours entering in my data, there is apparently no way to get to the final filing stage. With four days before the due date, this is disasterous. Their support site offers no hint of a fix. Mac users, stay away

This was my first time to ever attempt using a software program to file my taxes. TurboTax sounded easy enough. And it was pretty easy at first. The software interviewed me in an efficent manner and saved all of my information. But the final tax forms I needed to file with were not included on the CD-ROM package. TurboTax instructed me to get them by using "one-click update." Well after I update and attempt to restart the software, TurboTax refuses to come up at all. I can't speak for this software on Windows machines. But if you are using Mac OS X, I suggest you explore other options first

The program does a great job in figuring my taxes. But now Intuit is charging for filing and the state program. Also I was unable to download the updates over my dial-up connection.  I called to have a CD version mailed to me but so far I haven't received it. I'm trying Tax Act this year. It is a free program and has free filing. IF I can complete the TurboTax version I will see if I can duplicate my return using Tax Act.  If so then good bye TurboTax

I have used Turbo Tax for about 20 years and have loved it.  In the past it was user-friendly, efficient and complete - it even printed out all the forms I needed - ready to send to the IRS.

As usual, I purchased it this year.  
The format changed and isn't nearly as user friendly as in years past.  You have to manually select the walk-through feature, section by section and it's very easy to miss sections.

When I got to the end, it wouldn't let me do a review for errors until I updated the version.  But, I don't have internet at home and couldn't update.  It crashed my computer 3 times before I skipped the review totally.  (God only knows what else I skipped in the process.)

When I went to print the forms - again it nagged me that the software was inferior and needed to be updated.  Again, I skipped it but the pages printed out with a nasty watermark saying the forms weren't updated and couldn't be used.  I can't use these.  I can't send them to the IRS.  So, I have to find IRS forms and manually insert the information myself.  So, why did I spend money for the software??

Why would they sell a product that you can't actually use?  Yes, it'll "prepare" my forms.  But, what good is that if I can't print them out?  

Why would they sell a product that was already so obsolete that you can't use it without contacting the company for another version?

ABSOLUTELY - RUN - DON'T WALK - RUN RUN RUN AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT.  DON'T BUY IT because it simply doesn't work.

I won't use Turbo Tax again.  They have lost a faithful and long time customer

I kid you not, this suite,program,resource *THUG* IS THE WORST GARBAGE ON THE MARKET. Like others i read the shiny reviews and took a chance and purchasing it because of the frequent trips to HELL I had logged in with other so called "SECURITY SUITES" over the years. Works ok for about the first month or so and then...WHAMMMM..crash city. Think I'm joking...buy it and find out for yourself. I'm no PRO yet, but i do have enough knowledge about programming to know when my PC goes from( NORMAL to CHOKE) out of the clear blue. Uinstalled it (3X) just to make sure that it was the cause of the problem,sure enough,it was. Other reviewers mentioned thier processor being pulled to the grind...well it's true. STAY AWAY...STAY FAR..FAR..AWAY

The most recent version 7.0 was sent via a downloaded upgrade to owners of this ZoneAlarm Internet Suit a couple of weeks ago and has been a nightmare.  The ZoneAlarm forums are filled with user's complaints.  This software is full of bugs, it has crashed user's OUTLOOK and OUTLOOK EXPRESS email programs, and we are unable to use our email.  ZoneAlarm customer service is the worst!  It took them 6 days to respond to my technical request email, and the response was canned and not appropriate to the problem.  I finally called their corporate office and was told "if you don't like the program uninstall it!".  If your want to speak to their technical support they charge $2.99 per minute, even if the problem was caused by them!  At this time the software remains not fully use-able, I have no email from OUTLOOK, ZoneAlarm has not owned up to the nightmare they have created with their users, and they are not responsive as to when a fix will be available.

I've been a long time user of Trend Micro's PCcillin but after reading poor reviews on their latest version I decided I didn't want to take a chance on it so I went looking for different anti-virus software. I stumbled onto this ZoneAlarm (piece of junk) and after reading mostly wonderful reviews I down loaded their trial.  It didn't seem too bad. After a few weeks I bought this 3 computer suite and installed it. I went a while longer and notice my computer's performance was not as good as it was. I downloaded upgrades and uninstalled old versions and installed new.  Now after about a month my computer is practically unusable (as well as the kid's - they have been screaming about slow computer since the start).  
This zonealarm is the worst software I have ever used.  It hogs CPU and memory.  It gets the CPU usage to 80 - 100% and it doesn't free it up.  I shut down all programs and CPU just keeps churning away. The interesting thing is that at times I would check task manager processes and system idle would be 90% but when you check the performance tab the CPU chart would be near 100%?  Go figure! I finally said enough and uninstalled it (and deleted every occurrence of zonealarm out of the registry) and downloaded Trend Micro's pccillin.  It's installed and I got my old machine back.  Log-ins take 40 seconds were they would take over 3 minutes with ZA.  CPU is back to normal.  You couldn't give me this cr*ppy software.  I wish I would have stuck with pccillin and saved the $40

I bought this product because of positive member reviews and and outstanding review in CNet. However, I just bought a new Dell Inspiron E1505 that shipped with Windows Vista Home Premium, and ZoneAlarm 6.5 is flat out incompatible with the new OS. I downloaded ZoneAlarm 7.0 and that is flat out incompatible as well. I'm sure this is a great Security Suite for Windows XP, but beware if you have Vista. There seems to be no update on their website when Zonelabs will release a Vista compatible ZoneAlarm. (They mention something about "after January 2007", but it's March, for crying out loud!) So there's my purchase price of a good product down the drain

I purchased this product after reading many negative reviews on other products (my last Internet security product was PC-Cillin, I didn't renew because of the Low ratings for 2007). What I found was that an huge load was put on my processor, and system memory apparently because I use a program that feeds video over the internet from a network cam.  I never had problems like this before, and after some research on the ZA support site, I found other users who were having similar problems with their processors overclocking.  VSMON.exe seems to be the culprit, and is the main component of the Zone Alarm product.  Everything seems fine, as long as I don't try to use video over the internet(including IM webcams).  I would recommend thinking about if you intend on using webserver programs before making this purchase

I bought a new PC last week and maxed it out with a gig of ram and 512 video card...Vista was preinstalled...

These are the basic specs of the PC I have:

AThlon 64 X2 dual core processor
2 Gig memory DDR 2
250 SATA HDD

not only did this thing run slow...I found out that a lot of my old software wouldn't work...what gives????

I ran Company of Heroes (seemingly a surefire bet considering the upgrades) and that crawles like I was trying to run this on a minimum spec'ed machine...and mind u I bought this new AND did upgrades (an extra 250 dollars worth) so I wound up spending a nice part of Saturday reformatting the HDD and putting XP back on my machine and viola! I really get to see whta kind of power I am working with...

for those of you thinking about going back to XP, do it and wait until Vista gets figured out...it's 250 dollar resource hog and it won't be on my machine for a little while...and while u are at it...please be sure to back up your drivers files...

I bought the vista upgrade with my dell computer.  I tried to install and half way through the set up, after it had uninstalled my old programs, I got a message to abort.  The abort left me with a damaged media program, and thus far I have spent over $400 trying to re-connect damaged files and programs.  My best advice is to wait until Microsoft gets the "kinks" out of the vista program and then buy the upgrade

This maybe the worst interface I have ever had the displeasure of working with and that includes console applications with DOS interfaces. Edlin and fdisk are more user friendly than the McAfee's Security Center. There is noway to disable the software except by uninstalling the program or opening XP's admin tools and then forcing the services to stop, which is not a recommenable approach for the average user.

Here is a short list of the probelms that I encountered. Counter Spy is cheaper, easier to use and has an interface that is user friendly!

* cannot select to disable during non-internet use so I can run software that Security Center has conflicts with like ProTools 7.3 recording software.
* the scan results are vague, ie returns 6 quarantined threats but doesn't display what the threats are and you can't print the result either.
* There are more......

There are some good features but the detractors win by a land slide.

Much worse than previous McAfee editions.

I dropped Norton on some older desktops due to its lack of support for W2000. I then went to the free edition of AVG anti-virus, which was OK but slowed things down. Thinking "you get what you pay for" I sprung for McAfee which has been OK in the past. The edition I purchased has 3 licenses.  I installed one of these on my wife's XP laptop as well as one of my desktops (luckily, she's still talking to me).

The 2007 McAfee Suite makes AVG look like a free Ferrari. Absolutely terrible performance, coupled with a mediocre interface. Perhaps the only poorer-performing way to assure you'll never get a virus, spam, etc. would be to hit your motherboard with a hammer.

This will slow down your computer (even worse, unpredictably). If you have lots of email in Outlook or Outlook Express expect to open your mail box, then have a long break before you can do a thing (as it rechecks everything for spam). There's a partial workaround for this, but users shouldn't have to search for workarounds. Every Web action now has noticeable latency -- as well as slower applications when McAfee is grinding away in the background.  If you liked your current anti-spam, kiss it goodbye -- McAfee may not let you keep it. McAfee (like Norton) is also difficult to remove from your system. What prompted this review? Today it appears the update process rebooted my computer without requiring a "yes" from me.

As for alternatives, I wasn't able to get Kaspersky anti-virus to run on an older machine -- somewhare a remnant of Norton persisted (possibly a document tagged Symantec etc. left over from a day of working with them ages ago). However, I did get it running on a laptop and its better than Norton-McAfee-and even AVG in my opinion.

So, consider Kaspersky or another vendor. If that doesn't work try AVG. 

It will be interesting to see how McAfee responds -- they've really shot themselves in the foot with this release

I have used McAfee for at least 5 years. This 2007 Suite is a piece of trash. I takes soooooo long to find a site that IF it eventually finds it you forget what you were looking for.  At half the sites, if they are found, it will not allow me to progress into the site. In setting it up it insisted upon registering but never did tell me if the registration was completed; just kept blinking. I assume it was registered because it did update. I cannot get into half the sites I visit on a regular basis. It won't even find the McAfee site. Just sits there searching until it gives me a notice it can't find the site. Never will I buy another piece of software from McAfee. I should have read the reviews before I bought it but I had been satisfed with the previous version so I never bothered reading them. Dumb move on my part. Dumb one on yours if you buy it. Never again.

As everyone else has said, this product is not at all what it should be.

It slows down the internet browsing to a crawl (my laptop that has crashed several times, is several years older and runs wireless loads pages faster than my new computer with McAfee).

You can't close it, as others have said, other than uninstalling.

The funniest part I've found, however, is that it warns you the first time it tries to access.  Being amused, I refused the program permission to update itself.  Other than removing the program, it was the best thing I did using McAfee

Buyer beware: this program will critically impair your system!  Internet loading will be drastically crippled.  Expect frequent system choppiness due to automatic downloading and background processes.  There is NO WAY to close McAfee to get around these drawbacks other than to uninstall.  I am going to return this first thing next week.  I gave them a few weeks to improve performance with patches and upgrades, but nothing has changed.  If only I had read the reviews ahead of time.  
Bottomline: if you don't mind these side-effects, by all means purchase this program;  McAfee has solid protection.  But there are easier ways to get that protection

I had McAfee ISS 2006 and loved it.  I bought 2007 when my subscription expired.  Oh my dear God!! What have I done!!  The thing is complete crap. My computer is 1 year old with duel core chip and 2GB of memory.  This thing never crashed.  I loaded 2007 and it was crashing every 5 minutes!!  I could not get on the internet with my browsers.  McAfee was updating and Microsoft was reporting the serious errors with no problem, but forget about trying to get help from their website.  They have got to be kidding!!  I tried to uninstall it, forget about it.  I was able to get enough of it off so that my computer is able to access the internet and not crash every 5 minutes.  Thanks alot McAfee, you took a good product and turned it into crap and made a mess of my computer.  I downloaded a free firewall and AVG anti virus.

I didn't use this particular product but the version that came with my computer which was slow but not the end of the world. The problem I had with them is that they aoutomatically renew your subscription without giving any warning that they are going to do it. I had a 2-year subscription and they send me an e-mail 2 years later saying they charged my account with never telling me that I was in auto enrollment! When I called to complain they of course had someone who couldn't inderstand me and I had to spell my e-mail address THREE times and was told it would take 3-5 days for the refund to be processed which is crap because I work for an online store and its easier to void a sale and cheaper for the vendor to do a refund the same day! I asked for a manager TWICE, the second time they came back they had the nerve to ask me if I was interested in an upgrade and subscribing to their magazine, and was put on the never-ending hold until I gave up 37 minutes later which was probably the plan all along. SO I called my bank and put a stop payment on the automatic payment. Now I am searching for another protection program and calling their customer service before my purchase to see how it goes

Do not use this product.  It is very hard to remove from your computer.  It is harder to install than Norton, and is an inferior product.  I will never buy their product again.

Yes, it's easy to install, configure and use. The footprint is small and it doesn't hog resources. That's the good news. The bad news is that this software's virus detection rate is abysmal and the company's tech support is worse. So, in short, don't *trust* it. 

Two examples, starting with tech support. After building a new computer, I had several blue screens (stop errors, BSODs) and my analysis seemed to indicate that EZ Antivirus was at least partially responsible. I emailed support with all the relevant info. Their (paraphrased) reply: "We understand that you are having Faults in Windows. This is because you have Windows installed. If you did not have Windows you would not have Faults. Thank you for contacting E-Trust." I should have that engraved on a plaque. 

Example 2, AV detection: When my subscription ran out, I uninstalled EZ and tried a demo of Kaspersky. It found 5 viruses on my computer that EZ never told me about. In this case, it's 2 strikes and you're out. Goodby, Computer Associates

Like some of the other reviews, I loved cool edit pro. Then Adobe got a hold of it and royally screwed it up with 2.0. I use this program often and tried to give it a chance. No way around it, it sucks now. I am going to use Sonar, a much better product. The only thing I like about 2.0 is that you can burn to a disc from Audition. That is the only reason why I gave it one star. This is not a user friendly program

I agree with the other reviews this is a horrible piece of software. I am a software developer and have written some serious applications in my career, and this one ranks at the bottom of the barrel.

I have a stock Dell XP machine, and after a 15-minute install, Audition 2.0 crashes every time on startup. I never even got it to run. Tried calling Adobe support -- useless...waited 35 minutes on hold then hung up. Search of Google groups for answers revealed nothing, as did their support site.

I *loved* Cool Edit 2000, and even Audition 1.5 to some degree. This new version is what happens when too many engineers get put on a project. It's a remnant of a once great application. Avoid it like the plague

I wanted to make sure people who look at this product have a full understanding that Adobe Audition 2.0 WILL NOT install on a Windows 2000 Pro or Server operating system. Almost EVERY reference I have seen regarding OS requirements say Windows but not specifically Windows XP. The only exceptions have been on the Audition box itself and this Amazon listing (go Amazon). So if you are a Windows 2000 user understand that you will need XP for this product. If you can find a copy of Audition 1.5 you're good to go.

I would say more about the product if I could actually get it installed but with the 12 PCs I use not a one has XP so I have a $300+ book end until I can upgrade (if you can call it that) to XP

Adobe Audition is my favorite program. I use it more than any other program I have on my computer. I have used it to restore thousands of old phonograph discs. I am only giving them one star because I can't give them no stars for this joke.

I knew this was going to happen. I had been using Cool Edit Pro for a long time when Adobe bought it and I knew that they were going to turn it into an Adobe product and screw it all up. I am very fortunate that I went to Adobes web site and downloaded the free trail version. I would have been really upset if I had actually paid money for this dog.

Lets start with the boot up time. I own a 2 year old average laptop and Audition 1.5 used to boot in about 2 seconds. 2.0 takes 20 seconds. That is almost as long as Photoshop or Premiere Pro. 

Next we have the user interface. They destroyed it. And the old one worked so well. Adobe is really hung up about making absolutely everything a "Palette" and so now every little thing is a palette, allowing you to resize and relocate them to your hearts desire. But after about a half an hour of trying I'll be darned if I could not make the 2.0 interface remotely resemble the 1.5 interface. 

The shortcuts buttons have been removed (wow that makes a lot of sense), however you can get it back if you look long enough for the place to do it. (Don't bother to right-click anything, in their imperial wisdom right-clicking is now pretty useless.) But if you do put the shortcuts back up they are now all black and white and it is really difficult to find the one you want. In place of the shortcuts they added some icons that I have yet to figure out or to need. What are they thinking????

A lot of the presets have been reconfigured and trying to figure them out gave me a headache. 

After several hours of playing with this pile of garbage I decided to uninstall it and return to using 1.5.

If, like myself, you have many DX and VST plug-ins installed on your system, then Audition 2.0 is definitely NOT the choice with you.  Somehow, the idiots who made this junk have made it completely incompatible with 3rd-party plugs such as Waves Diamond Bundle.  Oddly enough, this was not a problem in earlier editions of Audition, or its former incarnation, CoolEdit.  But now, Audition crashes irrevocably when trying to use many VST and DX plugs (except, of course, the ones made by Adobe themselves.)

Bottom line?  This software is crap.  Absolute crap.  If you're serious about audio production, go with Wavelab.  Heck, even free multitrack audio software like Kristal works better than this.

If, for some reason, you absolutely need Audition, then go with an earlier, more stable version, such as 1.5.

2.0 is about as useful as a football bat.

I am not a bookkeeper. Without bookkeeping software I would be lost! I own a small business and help keep books for a friend's business. I have Quickbooks from 1996 and love it so I convinced my friend to get this newer version. I am very disappointed with the format and see very little similarity between them. Aarrrgh!

This program is terrible to deal with.  I run a small business and bought QuickBooks Simple Start.  Once loaded and you go to use the program there is a pop up requiring you have an Administrator.  When loading the software it does not tell you to select or bypass the Administrator requirement.  You only learn this when you first go to use the program. The URL they give on the pop up for troubleshooting does not address this issue, either.  You are just locked out of the program.  Now it gets fun. So, you have to speak to them for help.  But this is where it gets to be no laughing matter.  To get help you have to email them to ask for help.  They then call you back at their convenience.  If you are busy working when they call back you have to start all over.  I have yet to be able to use this product since I bought it 3 weeks ago because they will not call back when it is convenient for me the customer and will not let me call in at my covenience.  Even worse, since they have bought out all their competitors QuickBooks customer support no longer is available after regular hours when a small business owner has the time to handle such operations issues.  I can't return this product for a refund because I have loaded it.  My first clue to how not user friendly this product is should have been the title: Simple Start

I'm sure it's a good product for beginners, but I already had an older version of Quickbooks (from 1995) and the only way I could export/import the old data into a newer version of Quickbooks was with QB Pro.  Simple Start doesn't allow you to import data from older versions

This is by far the most basic editing/creative package that I have ever used.  I have been using every version of Print Shop since some of their early versions.  I have Print Shop 22 and was haveing issues with printing in MS Vista.  I figured that I would be able to purchase one of Broderbund's similar products (one made for Vista) and it would be similar in style and usage.  Wrong.  I was not able to import other Print Shop projects, printing is limited, no drag and drop feature from other programs, limited editing, formating of text is off when copying from one document to another, sizing pictures and text boxes while editing projects is limited to dragging corners only, and on-and-on.  I tried to use Broderbund's tech support page, but it is very limited to their FAQ section.  Try asking a question or emailing for help; good luck.  I will fumble with this product for awhile (only because I can print more than one page at a time, because PS 22 in Vista only allows for this)and wait until the next compatible version of PS comes out for Windows Vista.  I would have thought there would of at least been a patch by now.  I think they may have made Zoom the way it is now to allow for newer, better versions.  I hope this helps...

I was very disappointed in this software.  It's not really good for anything and I still haven't figure out why this was even released.  I own Printmaster 15, American Greetings Creata Card 8, and an few other photo and scrapbook programs.  This software has templates to make banners, cards, invitations, and all that stuff.  The templates are few compared to other programs and then to customize them, well you really can't.  If you try to start out with a blank template and add your own photos you are limited to what you can do.  No borders, edging, font manipulating.  It's just insert the photo, do some basic photo touch ups and that is pretty much it.  I wanted to add shadows, edges, frames to my pictures and couldn't.  The fonts could only be made in single color.  You could not add outlines or drop shadows, NOTHING.  Add the font, pick your size, pick your style, and that was it.  You can only save to their 1 file format which of course only works with zoom.  No e-mailing or file converting.  What good is this program I have yet to find out.  I spend time to make a birthday invitation from my own pictures.  Well guess what, I couldn't e-mail it to my guests.  Print is all it does.  Complete waste of money.  This is the first software I ever purchased that I will be returning.  Spend a few extra bucks and get something like Print Master, Print Shop, or something comparible

I bought this product based on Consumer Reports review.  I've had Norton and McAfee in the past which slowed down my system.  My computer is slower to start up with ZoneAlarm, but faster than McAfee while on.  However, most of the time, I need to shut off ZoneAlarm in order to access the internet - just like another reviewer.  Defeats the purpose don't you think?  It also recognized my offices's software as a virus and although I allowed access, it keeps showing it as a virus.  I'm going to have to go to another product.

The idea of being notified of every possibly suspicious action sounds good, but in practice ZoneAlarm is too intrusive for most home computer users. It seems to have bugs too, starting with an installation that initially wouldn't work on one of the computers on my home LAN. ZoneAlarm also seems to forget some actions that are allowed and supposedly remembered. I haven't gotten exasperated enough to buy another antivirus product and uninstall ZoneAlarm yet, but I'm close

I am very disappointed in this program.  I have been doing my own graphics/cards for about 10 years.  I started with Print Shop (early edition) and progressed thru all the updates.  I then switched to PrintMaster and LOVED it!!!  Again, I have progressed to each new verion with very little or no problems...until now!  This has got to be the worst of the worst--- the program did not want to load without being babied.  When it finally loaded, it was very confusing and I found that I needed to get my graphics from the internet!  The area I live in only allows me to have dial up---you can imagine how long it takes to get the graphics I want!  If you are interested in doing your own graphics/cards, skip this program...go back to PrintMaster Platinum 16 for much better results.  As far as I am concerened, the River Deep Company needs to hide this edition in the DEEPEST RIVER they can find

I've been using a Win 98 version of this software for years and the opportunity to upgrade to the XP version was tempting.
However, it does not work at all in my portuguese XP.
After searching for the misterious error code through the manufacturer's database I was informed that it does not work in non-english Win XP.
All the previous versions worked fine in my PCs but this one was totally disappointing. Living in Brazil, I had to give up my money since the shipping costs were about the same value I would recover.
Shame on them

What an incredible lie.
This is such a piece of junk.  It has almost nothing.  The cards look TERRIBLE, a total embarassment.  It's HARD TO USE, it's easier to make it in Word.

I love PrintMaster.  I'm currently using PrintMaster 16 Platinum.  I have used many generations of this program with great success.  I have taught classes on creative desktop publishing and always recommended--even sold--PrintMaster, but this one is terrible!  Most of the images, even the previews, seem to be online and require a download which is very slow.  The thumbnails are low resolution and hard to see, so you have to download previews just to get a good look.  Most of the images can't be accessed at all, because there is a prompt for the intall/program disk.  There is no such disk.  There are separate install and program disks, neither of which satisfies the program.  
  Encore, which now distributes the program, does not support it.  Broderbund does not not support it, except through its website which does not address this issue.  If you try to phone customer service, you pay for a call to get an automated response which sends you to another response which tells you to go to the website.
  Do not purchase this product without a money-back guarantee

I've used Printmaster 12 platinum on DVD and liked it well enough but the disk wore out.  I knew from reviews of subsequent versions that Broderbund was giving us less and less but even still I was stunned by just how much less.  Where are all the projects?  Even counting the online projects there just isn't much here for anyone.  For kid's masks, version 12 has at least a dozen but this version gives you 2!  The cards are terrible - many are just small clipart images with a white background.  (At least you won't need much ink).  In short, if you want to create anything decent you'll have to design it yourself.  Inspired by the ONE nice-looking cut-out card, I was able to search the art work and create several nice cards that I would be pleased to send.

I have used lots of PrintMaster versions I had some trouble with version 16 with the address book so I was happy to find that a new version was out and called to order they told me I wouldn't have a problem with the new one.  This new version is JUNK; all the projects have to be downloaded so if you don't have a high speed connection forget it!  I don't like the fact that you have to go on line every time you want to create a card etc.  I sent a note to customer service and just received a generic response.  So looks like I have to find new software

Everyone uses office.  Everyone is familiar with office.  So why did MS change the interface to make it nearly IMPOSSIBLE to get anything done?  I am computer savy (I'm an engineer) and I find the new ribbon interface totally infuriating.  Worst of all there is NO way to go back to the "old" drop down menu system.  It honestly takes me 10x the time to get anything done with word/powerpoint because they've buried functionality behind these ridiculous ribbons.  MS claims that you will be able to be much more productive once you're familiar with the ribbons.  I don't know/care whether that's true or not.  The learning curve to get to the point of fluency with their new UI is immense.  So much so that the time investment to become proficient FAR FAR FAR out ways any "increase" in productivity....not to mention that it's overpriced.  Offce 2003 is a far superior product

I just wanted to write a little note about getting the case open.  I just received my copy today, and in my excitement discarded the darn instruction on how to open......I know you're all probably thinking I'm just stupid.....after realizing what I did - I'd have to agree!  :)

Anyway, if you pull off the "peel" tab and get rid of it - here's what you do:  

See that red tab at the top of the box/package?  Hold the case from the "spine" and pull the little red tab down.  I found it most effective if I used my thumb and index finger (I'm right handed) on the tab and placed my middle finger on the top of the spine, and pushed a little with my middle finger.  I've gotten so used to ink cartridges, and other items that have a "don't pull this yet" type of tab, I was a little afraid of touching it....until of course I finally found what I did with my "peel" notice and found I did need to pull on the little red tab.  

So that's all there is to it.  Again, most of you out there probably think I'm stupid - but for the one or two others out there that tossed that peel tab  - Enjoy.  I'm going to install tomorrow, and once I've used the programs I'll see about a real review then

The product was fine, but, I received an older version and as a result I couldn't properly update it even after registering it.  As a result, I purchased the newest version available directly from Lavasoft and it works fine and I have had no trouble updating it.  Why didn't you specify what version it was on your website; then I could have made an informed decision?

The software requires a "patch"...not a big deal.

Once I got the thing up and running my attention span was about 5 minutes.  The "goofiness" is a detriment and the aspect of trying to learn is hindered by the balance of trying to figure out how to use the software.

It has a tutorial but that is a waste of time as well.

If you are SERIOUS about trying to learn some basic conversational Spanish, try something else.  Don't waste your time or money on this one..

Great product for what it does!  However, my experience with Quicken products such as Will Maker is that there are no updates.  You'll have to buy the next year's version to stay up to date for changes in your state.  At the end of 2007, the software is obsolete

But after installed, I can not access my yahoo email. After calling customer service two times, even uninstalled PC-Cillin, I still can not access yahoo email. Now I have to re-install Windows XP. It will cost me a lot of time. Anyone knows what wrong is

This upgrade is a disaster. First of all, in Word, the view markups function is the default now, so you have to go through and change all the settings to hide markups (most people in my department do not want to see those distracting colors and balloons and do not need to edit the doc in any way). However, if you want to send a document that does not have the tracked changes embedded -- because you don't know which version of Word the recipient has, and you can't take the chance of them seeing all those comments -- you have to go through the document again, view markups, reject the comments, Accept Changes, and resave. It's kind of difficult to explain, and frustrating too. People think that if they can't see it, then the recipient won't be able to see it either.

This is a good explanation from a Microsoft help forum:

*Not displaying* tracked changes isn't the same as *not having* tracked changes. Even when using Word 2002, the changes were still in the documents, and anyone could see them just by turning on the display. All that has happened in 2003 is that the display is automatic. The way to have documents in which changes are not displayable is to remove the changes from the documents entirely -- and to do that you must *accept or reject* all the changes. Nothing you do with the view will be sufficient. If you need to retain a record of the changes, you'll have to maintain two sets of documents: one with the changes, which *never* leave your office, and another that has been "scrubbed" and can be sent out. 

Still, it's a big problem and more unnecessary work than 2002's version. Also, Outlook's new default view is quite different than before. The panes are set differently, so you have to go to View/Reading Panes to change the positions. And then you have to ungroup items (the breaks in between the weeks are very annoying...most people don't like that, although I guess some people think it looks more organized).

Oh, Microsoft - can't live with it, can't live without it.

Almost forgot...the buttons/icons are prettier in this version, and we all know that that makes a huge difference. Yessss! Pretty buttons! I can die happy now.

If you have not bought this yet, don't. If you have, but haven't installed it yet, don't. 

I've used Quicken for years, and this is the worst implentation yet. The major problem, an issue known to the company, is that reports will not print properly on many printers. 

Wait until they issue a fix before you use this product

Well you certainly will be able to recognize words and answer the questions correctly, but if you're expecting to understand what the words actually mean...I wouldn't recommend this.
I was able to answer the first seven chapters easily and get all questions right but I have no idea what any words in the sentence/caption actually mean.  
I've used it for a month know and I have no greater knowledge of Chinese than when I started....

If you do not have a mediocre-level understanding of Chinese, stay away from this product.  Rosetta Stone has a very unique approach that might work for children under the age of seven (the critical language learning years), but for every other beginner in the language the software is almost impossible to use.  The object of the "game" is to match a Mandarin phrase (said aloud and written in pinyin) to a poor, pixellated photo.  For example, in the first section of the first lesson, you are shown a ball, an airplane, an elephant and a horse.  A phrase will be read and you have to match it with the correct photo.  It gets much too complicated after that.  Basically, it's a pure guessing game for most of the time.  I gave this product a serious evaluation even after reading the plethora of poor reviews.  I thought the unique style was interesting enough to give a chance, but I feel as though I wasted hours and hours.  I can remember only two or three words from the entire experience.  Although I have spent fewer hours on Pimsleur's Mandarin audio lessons, I am able to recall many, many more words and phrases.  Although Pimsleur's isn't perfect, it's definitely the best choice for a beginner (along with a solid Chinese-English dictionary).

If you do not know well the basics of Mandarin, this software is completely useless.  Buy Pimsleur's instead

This is the most god awful method for learning a language I have ever encountered. My jaw dropped when I saw that NASA and other government agencies were using this software in order to learn a foreign language. If that is truly the case then I demand my tax dollars back. It is THAT bad. The reason I gave this software a shot is because their marketing campaign has been asserting that it was the absolute definitive method for learning a new language. You're probably looking at it for the same reason.

First, you should know that you can purchase a set of flash cards from your local bookstore and it is just as effective as any rosetta stone softare and costs 90% less.

I used this software when I borrowed it from a friend in order to see if it was better than my current method of learning mandarin, which I'll get into later. I had an opportunity to make copies of this software when it was in my possession but decided against it. Not out of fear of piracy penalties, just plain because I would rather not have this software than have a copy of it. That's really how awful it is.

Imagine if your parents tried to teach you English by only teaching you noun/picture association? It wouldn't work unless you learned about proper English grammar and proper syntax. If you learned about verbs and other things. This program will assume you know all your Chinese numbers automatically. In the very beginning a picture of a little girl will show up and it will verbally say 'one little girl' in mandarin... however it will not tell you which word means the number one, which word means girl, and so on. It's a guessing game, not a learning experience.

All the positive reviews I've seen for any Rosetta stone software on amazing seem absolutely phony and fabricated to me (especially on the Rosetta Stone Japanese page). Please beware, and there is no better way to prove that what I'm saying is true other than trying a demo for yourself. I am sure that it is as bad as the full retail version that I used for a week.

The absolute best method I've used for learning mandarin has been pimsleur's audio cds. (I've never tried berlitz and pimsleur's other competitors, but I'm sure they are better than Rosetta stone). I have used Mandarin I and II so far from pimsleur, and I am able to hold impressive conversations with other fluent speakers of mandarin. The great thing about it is that pimsleur explains everything to you, allows you to say it out loud, there is no brute memorization involved with pimsleur, only natural language assimilation.

Just ask yourself this, when you learned English as a child. Did you learn    by learning how to read and write first? Or did you learn how to speak and listen first? Didn't you learn syntax first and then use what you learned to formulate your own sentences? That's exactly how pimsleur has taught me mandarin. I was surprised how I was able to create my own grammatically correct sentences with pimsleur only a few lessons in.

Go ahead and try a demo of any Rosetta stone language. It should be enough to keep you away from Rosetta stone in favor of any of their competitors.
I've heard good things about berlitz and others, but pimsleur in my opinion is the absolute best.

You've got to be kidding me. There is no English translation, just pictures and Mandarin phrases.

How are people suppose to figure it out without a straight forward english definitions or explanation for each phrase?

They're suppose to be teaching Mandarin to an English speaker, not some boy raised by wolves who never knew any language.

This is retarded. Worst product ever.

Their approach might work for other languages, but for Chinese it's critically important to understand the grammar of the language, which Rosetta Stone never explains. It simply displays four pictures at you, with some incomprehensible (to a beginner) Chinese near them, and you have to learn to match incomprehensible words with the pictures. I've taken Chinese for two years, and I still found it impossible to learn anything from it. I either knew the words already, or I couldn't learn whatever it was they were trying to teach.

I would be happy with just a videotaped lecture of a Mandarin college course, but I can't find anything like this for sale or free online

I liked the software itself.  Being the first year I used it, I thought I'd start being a regular TT customer.

Then it was April 17 2007 and I tried to e-file.  The servers would not respond ALL DAY. There were no admins to be reached on the support sites or the forums (except for one who said "I don't know what is the problem and I have nothing to tell you").

One major failing with this software is that it cannot AUTOMATICALLY try to connect.  If it fails, it says "try again in 10 minutes".  Which I've had to do all night.

Now - I will miss my tax deadline and have spent 6 hours at my computer trying to get connected.  Mail is not an option now as my car is gone.

This is a major failure of the company and an utter lack of support, since their officials apparently couldn't be bothered to come in to work on tax day to offer us any solutions.

I will not buy again.

This is a product that is dependent on constant upgrades because the most current version of the 2006 tax forms are often not available when it first comes out.  That is the nature of the product.  

However, for the third year in a row, many Macintosh users have run into problems with their automated online form upgrade process.  If the automated upgrade process does not work, you can do the upgrade manually, but that is a somewhat complex process.  Alternatively, you can order a snail mail version of the upgraded program, if you can ever get through to the phone number you have to call.  They always seem to be encountering a large volume of calls no matter what time you call.  

Its a great product once you get it upgraded to contain the most recent version of the forms.  I wonder if the automated upgrade process works for Windows users?  At any rate, until they fix the automated upgrade process, an important part of the software, I have to rate it as low as possible

Having used Turbo Tax since 1990 I feel that I am qualified to comment on it.
I have also used Quicken, Quicken Deluxe, Quicken Home & Business, QuickBooks Pro 2003 & QuickBooks Premier Contractors Edition. The Turbo Tax product seems to get more user UN-FRIENDLY each year.  The navigation features do not allow as much mobility thru the program as they did in the late nineties and early 2000's.  Like I said I WAS using QuickBooks Pro 2003 until tax time last year.  I purchased Turbo Tax Home & Business like I had for the past 4 years, and really got a shock when I found out that it would not import my data from QuickBooks Pro 2003.  Three year old software that was not compatible with Turbo Tax in 2006(actually 2005 tax year).  I ended up purchasing QuickBooks Premier Contractors Edition 2006 
($280+) in order to upgrade just to get my taxes done.  Intuit in my opinion is a perfect example of major corporate greed.  I am done with them and will purchase TaxCut this year

Mutual fund basis calculations are broken,  updates fail on the mac.  Not to mention no state in this edition.  It's absurd how many different versions of TurboTax there are this year.  It almost takes longer to try to figure out which one to buy than it does to do your taxes.  I'm done with TurboTax, switching to TaxCu

Have used TurboTax for years with no real problems.  The low rating is due to the following:

Bought this in a store and discovered later when trying to download the state that it is FEDERAL ONLY!  If I had known that I would have ponied up the extra minor $ in the store rather than the extra $30 for download.  

Last year the state was included with this version - this year Intuit's new fine-grained tiering of their product line ripped me off!

Also, the price for this product is way too high, and the lack of an upgrade path is (pay less if you are a loyal customer) completely sucks.  Intuit almost lost me a couple of years ago when they introduced product activation.  They are in serious danger of losing me again

I have 3 computers with different expiration dates for the installed Norton anti-virus programs.  I purchased the 3-pack and installed it into the computers as the old subscriptions expired.  I then found out that the clock for the 3 units started when the program was installed into the first computer.  When I contacted Norton, they acknowledged that it was designed that way and gave me a code to enter into the three computers in order to increase their protection to a full.  When the code was entered into the first computer the clock increased to 1 year in that computer.  Norton would not allow the code to be entered into the other 2 computers.  I will never purchase another Norton product

This program works after it's installed, but the installation process is unbelievably flawed.  If you have a version of Norton on your computer already, this may cause all kinds of problems with the new installation.  Not only did I have to uninstall all versions (after Norton lets you install the new one), but I had to make a bunch of changes to Windows, also.  

On top of that, while you're struggling to install (I got it on to one computer easily, a second with some difficulty, and the third... well, it's been several days of struggle), Norton counts down the number of days in the subscription.  So if you install on one computer today, and another two months later, then your subscription on all your machines still expires a year from now.

I don't see how Symantec can put out a program that doesn't allow you to upgrade easily... after all these years, they can't fix this major bug?  That's just pathetic

I spent 3 days trying to get this installed.  I think the complication was that I had Norton Systemworks 2005 and wanted to add the NAV 2006 on top of it.  Well I finally got it done, but not until I'd restored my system to a backup from before I'd installed NSW 2005.  At that point I had NSW 2003 installed.  I had to manually uninstall that and remove tons of entries from the registry.  Norton's automated uninstall failed over and over so I gave up on that and did it by hand.  Then I installed NSW 2005 with NAV.  When I went to install NAV 2006 it was unable to uninstall the old version.  So I had to restore the system again.  This time I installed NSW 2005 without NAV.  I was then able to install NAV 2006.  It is working now.  It just shouldn't be this difficult

Bought the 3pack for home use.  Installed it on two pc's and then had defective a defective new pc that it was installed on and removed.  NOW, it won't let me activate on the new computer - their system is flawed!!!!  They want me to mail in original invoice, unlock code and disk and THEN they'll see what they want to do.  This will all take at least 2 to 3 weeks, in the meantime there is no protection on this computer.  HAAAAA!

They really need to have a specific code for each activation so that it updates to the active computer it is being used on - they really could figure this out.  They're taking the easy way out and getting more $$$ in the process.

This combined with all other slow down issues, I'm switching to ZONE Suite, as I've used Zone Alarm for years and it is great.

Best of luck

Bought this 3-pack about 2 months ago (three computers at home) and worked ok- no viruses. Then I did what I thought was a clean install of XP Pro from XP Home on one of the computers, and it carried over a lot of garbage from XP Home I wanted to get rid of, but that's another issue (clean install?}. After installing XP Pro, I was warned I didn't have virus protection and so I tried installing my NAV again. You would think at some point NAV would have enough brains to try and establish that this was a Windows upgrade, and that the NAV was legitimate. Nope- fatal error and computer lock-up, which I was able to survive. No contact opportunity at the Symantec web site.

I simply opted for Microsoft's recommended anti-virus software- Computer Associates. Another twenty. Then I had a heck of a time uninstalling NAV, which wouldn't install and now wouldn't uninstall. What a waste of time and money. Who creates these viruses? We certainly know who benefits from them.

There is really nothing you can do- they are immune unless they hurt someone with media clout. This little note means diddily, but thanks to Amazon anyhow for the opportunity to say something.

I have a recently purchased Acrobat 8.0 Professional. It installed fine on my new Vista machine, although it cites only Office 2003 products. But I have MS Office 2007.  After installation (and reinstallation) no Acrobat conversion options show on MS Word, and when trying to use Acrobat directly for an MS Word file conversion it first reinstalls itself, and then reports that the Word file (I have tried several) is corrupt.

I now have to ask colleagues with older software to do my PDF conversion.
I could not find out if or when Adobe plans to be compatible with Vista and Office 2007

She just called me for school to help her resolve an ERROR in the installation: The install reaches 100% then states it has encountered an ERROR, and quits. It remains uninstalled and is thus far UNUSABLE. An awefully expensive piece of plastic that does NOTHING. As a Senior Software Engineer I'd have been fired for less ...

I specifically bought Turbo Tax Premier because of stocks sales/purchases we made in 2006.  The section on stock income was confusing and it took me several times to figure out what information Turbo Tax wanted where.  When I thought I had it figured out and finished that section, I thought I would repeat it to make sure I did it right.  To my surprise, the second time I entered the information I received a different total than the first time.  So I did it a third time.  The third time matched the second, so I figured it must be right.  Then when I got to the section for error checking, I was told I had errors in my stock sales.  So I did it a forth time, which came out the same as the second and third time.  This time it passed the error checking, but instead of showing that we had purchased the stocks, Turbo Tax showed we had "inherited" the stocks.  I could not get Turbo Tax to change, so I printed out the form scratched out "inherited" and put in the date of purchase.  I would rather do my taxes by hand than use Turbo Tax again

I have been using Turbo Tax for years just as I jave used Quicken for years.  One of the big plusses for me was It's Deductible, a program that places values on items you give to charities and imports directly into Turbo Tax.  

It's Deductible was a stand alone program until 2006 when it went to Intuit for online entries.  You could not longer buy the program to install on your PC.  This would have been OK but then Intuit would not allow you to see the values placed on donations until you purchased Turbo Tax.  Intuit thinking of the bottom line rather than the customer.  I hated that and told Intuit my feelings - no response as I expected.  But what the heck, I entered my donations through 2006 and when Turbo Tax 2006 came out I purchased it from Amazon for a good price.

After installing Turbo Tax I went to see what my donation values were and to import the values into Turbo Tax from my online entries.  Nope - No can do.  Not only was It's Deductible buried in Turbo Tax with a very clunky and slow link to start the program but there was absolutely no way to import.  After much searching on Intuit's support pages - always a chore - I finally found a page explaining - no import.  But if you like you can get a voucher to unlock the online values and then manually re enter the information into Turbo Tax!  What a crock.  On top of that using It's Deductible and Turbo Tax slows my duo core PC to a crawl.  I will look elsewhere next year

You can try this for free for up to 60 days by registering with Microsoft and downloading an evaluation copy. When you're sure you want it, permanently activate it with the product key you get in your Amazon package.

The new version of Excel has two huge advantages:

1. It removes the old 256 column/65,536 row limitation.  You can now have 16,384 columns and more than a million rows.  

2. Excel 2007 can use all the cores/processors in your computer (or you can restrict it to use only some, so huge background calculations do not tie up your machine).  On my dual core computer, Excel 2007 is **way** faster than 2003 at almost every task.

I've seen no crashes, hangs, or hiccups.

But everything else about Excel 2007 is frustrating.  The new "ribbon" interface is unnecessary and awkward -- almost every operation takes more pointing and clicking than older releases. Bypassing the ribbon with the new "Quick Access Toolbar" is problematic because (bizarrely) Microsoft has deleted many distinctive command icons, leaving them with identical green circles.

Right now Excel 2003 costs more than Excel 2007.  If the two plusses don't help you, you may think that 2003 is worth more

I excitedly upgraded to Office 2007....'07 Outlook is FAR slower - ties my reasonably powerful machine up in knots (110% of resources) for minutes at a time inexplicably; spell ck doesn't work consistently; HTML emails have lost functionality I used to use often with 2003 ver; Excel opens MUCH more slowly; no real gains in Excel fuctionality; various add-ins essential to my biz no longer work in Excel 2007; Access 2007 was billed as much easier to use - FALSE; Word has a couple of improvements but messes up spell ck with Outlook if you keep both Word 2003 & 2007 on yr machine; the highly touted "Ribbon" is mainly cosmetic; I believe 2007's indexing is at the heart of some of sluggisness which might be ok if it worked..but it retruns strange results....NET, NET, I am uninstalling Office 2007 and going back to 2003 with all its stupid faults....it's too bad no one at MSFT actually uses thier products to realize how defective they are.

Normally I might wait to install a new software upgrade, but I just got a new laptop and thought it would be best to use Office 2007 with the new Vista operating system. I was wrong.

You would expect that a multi-billion dollar company like Microsoft could put out a powerful and bug-free piece of software. But after a month of using Office 2007, you get the distinct impression that this software is not ready for public release. Microsoft should be ashamed.

I don't know the root cause of my problems, but I have to stress that I am running a clean install of Office 2007 on Vista, so there shouldn't be any software conflicts or issues. 

So what are my issues? The list is long:

-- My biggest concern is that MS Word constantly hangs and stalls. It can making editing a document very painful. I suspect the problem is when I put images or Visio diagrams into a document. But that is something the old MS Word was able to do without an issue. Oddly, if I have a colleague open the document and save it out in Word 2003, the problem goes away! What?! It's killing my productivity.

-- When ever I cut and paste from an old document, Word hangs for 15 to 20 seconds. And often the formatting and margins in my new document go haywire. I keep having to spend a ton of time fixing things. This never happened in the old Word. This is another time killer.

-- Every few days, Outlook 2007 starts telling me that it cannot display my email folders. Uh oh! I have to completely restart my computer to see my email again.

-- Outlook 2007 breaks many graphic emails that people send -- they look like a mess. It is because Outlook 2007 does NOT render HTML correctly since it uses the Word engine, not Internet Explorer to display email. I have no idea why Microsoft did this, but they have got to fix it.

-- Many of the issues in the old Word 2003 still haven't been fixed. If you place an image, it can often be hard to get it to appear correctly. Why can't they solve this one?

-- While most Office programs have the new ribbon interface (which I like), some programs like Visio 2007 do not. So you have to remember how to use two interfaces. Couldn't Microsoft find the time and money to update ALL its programs? Give me a break.

-- On a few occassions in Visio 2007, my files have failed to save correctly. At first I thought this must have been my fault, but it's happened to me a few times and can't be a coincidence. A few times I've gotten an error message and lost my work. Ug.

-- Word and Excel 2007 use a completely new file format. So anyone you send a document to has to have 2007 installed (which isn't likely the case). To get around this, you can save it down to a 2003 file format, but then you end up with two files on your hard drive -- one in the new format and one in the old format. What a pain! Also, there definitely seems to be an issue with Office 2007 opening older Office 2003 files. Could be the cause of many of my problems, but there is no way I can avoid using old files. They should have worked harder on compatibility.

There are good things about the new 2007. I do like the new interface design and the new features in Outlook 2007 are amazing for organizing tasks and sharing your calendar.

But I don't think it's fair that Microsoft released a product so full of serious, serious bugs that have cost me hours and hours of extra work. I didn't spend hundreds of dollars on a beta product and don't think the public should have to suffer. Surely they can afford to do better!

NEW ADDITION TO MY REVIEW:
Today I discovered that I can no longer paste Excel charts into Word like I used to. When I try, the chart goes in, but any bars/lines disappear.

I'm good with computers and have used other architectural software, and this was most disappointing.  In fact, if I had not bought this on Amazon, I would have returned it to the local retail store with huge complaints.  It was difficult to install--buggy.  It had problems rendering a drawing and would often lock up.  The "objects" that you pull from its library can sometimes be opened and resized--and sometimes cannot.  Hardly intuitive at all.  Also disappointing was the way multiple stories did not synch up.  I had reasonable expectations for this software, but wish I had bought something else.  For $10 it would be a good purchase.  For anything over that, you are wasting your money.  Try another product, a demo first, or something.  But in my opinion this was a big waste of money

I was so excited to get this! The terrain on our lot has quite a slant to it because we're on a hill. My husband and I thought this would easily help us create a materials list for our retaining walls that we wanted to put out front. Long story short... I spent hours (at least 40) getting the dimensions of our house correct and trying to get the yard right. We even rented a surveying instrument to determine the slope of our yard to input elevation points. MANY hours wasted... the software does not let you set the height of the retaining walls and it inputs random walls and pieces of wall in the 3-D view that you can't get rid of. The flowers are hard to place, they don't end up where you want them.  Besides, the "Plant Chooser" doesn't have hardly any perrenial plants to choose from.  

Bottom line: I spent $50 in software costs and $50 for a surveying instrument and ended up having to calculate the wall length and height manually.  If you have a flat lot, this might work well for you.  For anyone that has hills, or slopes to their yard, Good luck!

I work for a software company so I know a little about the user interface concept.  This is one of the worst packages I have ever used.  I just spent an hour trying to draw my house and get the dimensions right.  The automatic dimension builder did not work.  I had to draw it, and redraw it to get the dimensions right.  Then I added a few windows and doors, and 2 porches. Then I tried to use the camera to get a vertical view.  The whole file blew up - can't find it anywhere.  The manual is useless, and the tutorial CD is just an overview of each topic.  What a waste of moeny

I have moderate knowledge of computers, etc. and I found this overly complicated.  This is not intended for the novice.  However, even if you are not a novice it seems to still be a waste of money.  I wish I had not bought it at all.  Perhaps it has secrets and treasures I am not aware of...but the directions are complicated and it would be by chance that you would ever discover them.  Save your money...this was a waste

This game can get very boring. It's very confusing and hard to control. It is sooooo frustrating!!!!!!!!! The instruction booklet doesn't come in handy either. Like some other people, I only got rabbits too. I bought this game because I wanted to heal cats and horses. But, only rabbits came. Buying this game was a big mistake. It is reallly no fun. Don't waste your money on this game. I gave up about a month ago. I've left it on the shelf and haven't touched it since.

Conceptually this is a great game, especially for a child with visions of being a Vet. You (can theoretically) learn about animals, their care and health issues. Those 2 stars for overall are basically for the concept and little else.

Unfortunately the general usability of this game, vis--vis lousy controls, is quite low. It's nearly impossible to move the character at times, which results in stressful failure in the game. It crashes. It can't remember simple settings like, leave the terribly loud and obnoxious music off. 

Playing this multiple times with my 6 year old always goes from excitement to frustration (bordering on tears more than once as a bunny gets woefully ill while your character is comically stuck bouncing between the sofa and ottoman).  

Once going you can engage your child by "studying" the books you've bought. Also, as you analyze the patients you learn about ailments as well as the treatments. That is all good stuff, but on whole the game is too frustrating to enjoy. 

One final note, this is the first time I've ever bothered to review any product.

I was very excited to get this game.  I did read previously written reviews. My 13 yr old daughter wants to become a veterinarian someday and loves spending time on the computer, so this just seemed like the perfect Christmas gift.  Alas, the game has many faults that does interfere with the game being enjoyable!  I should have listened to the reviews.....

The game is extremely glichy!  It makes playing it very hard and frustrating.  My daughter tried for one week and has given up.  The characters get stuck and just stand and vibrate on the screen until you start the game over.  Sometimes she will play for a half hour before it starts up and sometimes it does this right away.  VERY DISAPPOINTING.  

Also, some internal setup issues of the actual CD is that it works better running from the disk then saving it to the computers hard drive.  We have a pretty new computer, we have windows XP - this program just doesn't run well off our computer anyway.  We have other games that don't have this problem. In fact my son got a game - building machines and inventions - and it doesn't have any of these problems and actually requires more from my hard drive.

Also, my daughter complains of some of the limitations within pet vet that don't allow her to change.  You have to pay a specified amount to hire an employee and the employee in this game is a slouch - there are no other choices when hiring staff, no wage choices, you can't get this employee to work or and you cannot hire anyone else.  

Overall because of the gliches in the game, she hasn't been able to play it to the programs full potential and has given up....so the idea is great.. but the makers should have looked at this better before taking the consumers money and putting it on the market.  I cannot find any fixes or downloads online to repair it either.  BIG BUMMER!!!  BEWARE!  JUST DON'T BUY THIS ONE, LOOK ELSEWHERE

After installing it, I got popup virus alerts from BitDefender every 10 seconds.  No kidding.  I couldn't believe it.  I previously had a copy of Norton AntiVirus 5 on my computer which is highly reliable (not like the latest version).  I tried BitDefender based on the reviews below which were obviously written by people with less than standard operating systems.  I use a PC with Windows XP SP2 and IE6 (IE7 is still buggy).  Although multiple runs of BitDefender show absolutely no viruses or malware on my system, I continue to get these popup "virus alerts" every 10 seconds when I browse the internet, which is way more irritating than anything Norton ever did to my computer.  In addition, it drags my computer to almost a screeching halt when I go to a web page I haven't been to in more than a day, sometimes even the ones I just went to an hour ago.  I find this truly irritating and went to BitDefender's website and tried their online chat.  "Jack" was completely worthless.  He told me to completely wipe out my cookies, as well as a lot of other useful files for no apparent reason other than he's probably not named Jack, but something like Vishnu and this was the first thing on a long list of things to tell people to do.  Very useless.  Not recommended for anyone.  Try to get an old copy of Norton Antivirus 5 and pay for the update feature ($20 per year).  Much better than this garbage.  

In addition, there are virtually no options to customizing this product.  You're stuck with what they think is necessary (like automatically deleting internet files you may need--like shopping carts).  It literally cripples your computer.

I made the unfortunate mistake of reading fantastic reviews for this product and trying it out myself.  I went online and purchased the program, downloaded, and installed on my pc.  Installation worked perfectly. I ran a scan and it even found viruses that Mcafee missed. However, any program that used the internet now freezes or takes forever to load. After closing web browsers I have to restart before my PC recovers.  I unistalled the program and now everything works great.  I'm shopping somewhere else for my Antivirus needs

I'd give this no stars but it won't let me.

Why would anyone buy this? I was in Compusa today as they are closing down on Long Island & thought about buying this. I put it down & said I will researh this more at home. As I suspected, you can go to [...] & do the same thing that this software does. The software doesn't allow you to print stamps at home so what's the point? The only plus is that you get a sheet of free stamps, so it's like buying a [...] coupon, that's a one time use. I don't get it

I brought the software beleiving that it would help me with my scrapbooking.  It has very limited graphics and templates to work
with.  I would not recomend this software package.  Also the journaling sucks as well.  Even when you start a product from scratch the software isn't user friendly with very little guidence. As stated before 1 star is to much.

Complete waste of money.  I purchased my copy at Wal-Mart but wanted to warn others before they made the same mistake I did.  The graphics and templates they use on the package to lure you in are nice and tasteful.  The actaul program is SO not like that.  The graphics are down right cheesy, and low budget.  Having only paid $9 for this program, I feel like I was completely ripped off.  I'll for sure be calling the company and asking for a refund. 1 star seems like too many to give this awful item

This software is a waste of money to say the least. The templates on this software are terrible and ugly. You are lucky if you have five good templates to choose from. If you are looking for something quick and easy to use this is not it.You have to format everything. Please don't make the same mistake I made. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT

If you read the license, you find that you probably give away rights to anything you use in a comic book.  It also looks like you can't give away copies of comics you print, certainly can't sell them, and can't let others copy them.  

Unless you want your child's face on a cereal box without your permission, you probably don't want this software

This program is limited to a few word bubbles and sound effect fonts.
It is difficult for a novice to understand how to get his or her own pictures into the comic. The word bubble sdo not rotate, so they could be pointing anywhere except where you want them to.

It looks really great on the cover of the CD, and that's what sold me.
It was a disapointing christmas

Once again QuickBooks dangles promises to us Mac folk that just don't add up. If you're like me, your accountant and bookkeeper are on Windoz - that's why I was psyched when I thought I would really be able to share my Mac QB files with them, and vice-versa. Mistake #1 - I give my bookkeeper a backup from QB 2006 before I updated to 2007. BIG mistake. QB is not backward compatable. So when my bookkeper sent the file back to me in Mac format, (after spending hours updating it), I was not able to import it into QB 2007. To me, this is nuts. But the helpful tech person we spoke with, suggested that even if it had been '07 this sharing business between Mac and Windows versions is sort of a one time deal. This wasn't intended to be a back and forth thing, between Mac and Windows. Huh? So what's the point?  Here's my work-around: I bought a used XP box on eBay and am trading my Mac '07 for Windoz '07.

We have used QuickBooks on a PC since the 1990's.  We loved the way Inuit made accounting accessible for people without degrees in accounting.  QuickBooks for Mac is TERRIBLE in comparison.  If you plan to use the payroll features, it is unusable.  QuickBooks Mac payroll redirects you to the internet, where it is handled by PayCycle (an independent company).  Payroll is not integrated at all in the Mac (instead import/export operation). On the PC, it is part of the QuickBooks application.  We could not get job costing to work, and the tax calculations made no sense.  We were paying TONS of money to PayCycle, so fortunately the taxes were filed automatically.  We finally reverted back to QuickBooks for Windows and are MUCH happier with Intuit handling our payroll

I imported from Quicken for Mac to Quickbooks Pro for Mac and after 3 weeks of trying to make the result work, I gave up. The interface is far less intuitive than in Quicken (for example, entering vendor names by typing the first letters then scrolling through the choices with the arrow keys as in Q) does not work in QB, forcing one to guess at the exact vendor name the first time; and the imported names and addresses do not go automatically to vendors if they have been paid, and customers if they provide payments; rather they all go to an 'other names' list that, with a thousand or two names in it, cannot be simply dragged to the  correct list; rather each one has to be edited individually. When I started forming invoices and quotes for customers, I found that QB would forget the customer's address, sometimes including it and other times yielding a blank field. Also the field lengths in QB are often shorter than in Q, resulting in incomplete import of memo fields. In addition, export capabilities are negligible; one can only export transactions and other details in a proprietary format that can't be used elsewhere, unlike Q which exports in a readable and massageable format. Overall it seems that QB has been written by a different company than Q, and to a large extent the programs are not compatible even though the import from Q to QB appears at first viewing to work OK. It is better to start a new financial year with new software and enter all data in again by hand rather than try to make QB use Q data, in my view. I have switched to MYOB AccountEdge at a rather higher cost, and find that this clean start at the financial year beginning works OK for me. The MYOB product is a little clunkier than QB with more fields to fill in and numbered accounts all over the place, and its Q import is a total joke (with repeated questions on where to allocate accounts for each transaction without an explanation screen) so that import of any more than 10 transactions becomes laughable) but its export abilities are wonderful and I think its inventory control is better than QB; also, it has not yet lost invoice addresses the way QB did on me. One has to input addresses in fields before memorizing tranactions however otherwise the memorized transactions in MYOB don't update. I have found that MYOB is about as intuitive as Q when it comes to entry of payee fields etc; while QB has lost that data entry ease entirely. QB may have an advantage if your goal includes payroll however; MYOB seems to have a pretty sad service unless you are prepared to pay all of the taxes yourself.

When I considered purchasing this product, I was confused to see that some people thought it was great, and others thought it was terrible.  I couldn't understand why there were such discrepancies in the reviews.

After I bought it I understood: For some of the things it does, it works fine -- no problems.  However, there are many major bugs in the software, and if you need one of the buggy functions, you'll be sorry you bought it.

Examples of some problems: 

1. If you burn an audio track entitled "Blue Fog" Nero will give it the title "Fog."

2. Every time I run a backup, it tells me there was a write error, but the backup seems OK.

3. I backed up every file on my drive, but when my system crashed, there were problems that prevented me from restoring my system.

4. It has blue screened my system one time.

5. Many commands are poorly or not at all documented.  For example, the wave editor has a declipper function, but there is no documentation on how to use it.

So, I'd recommend that you look instead at a competing product.

Good luck

I could be home in bed. But I'm Fing around trying to undo the install of the biggest mistake I've made to date...purchasing, tossing money in the toilet for Nero7. The damage and the time it's taken to recover is about 20 times it's cost. Useless. I can't copy a disk. I can't burn and image. What's the deal??? 

All the negative stuff I've read true. Unfortunately AFTER I paid for Nero7 BEFORE reading what others have to say. 

What really puzzles me is who all the folks are that are writing all the wonderful reviews? Employees of Ahead? 

Keep your distance or you'll be sorry

Nero 7 wants to prevent you from generating ISO files and instead wants you to use its NRG CD backup file system. Then it doesn't want you to burn WAV onto CD but forces you to invest in MP3 encryption so that you can burn MP3 to CD. The software is full of these horrible twists that Nero has gone from the best burning rom to the worst burning rom by simply making it harder for you to do what you want. I rolled back to Nero 5.5 and had a fully functional and top of the line burning rom again

This software suite promises to do everything on earth, but doesn't tell us how.  There is no useful help file.  There are no tutorials or instructions on the website.  And, Nero's support is a joke (just try to get a message through).  I don't understand how a company that started out with the best burn program in the game has sunk to this

This product is worse than useless.  Right off the bat, the tutorials do not behave as depicted.  What is left does not run properly.  I spent hours and hours trying to make a CD from an LP, all to no avail.To make matters worse, this bug infested monstrosity, has very poor support.  There is no 800 number.  The version that I had came with 10 days of tecnical assistance that was useless!  After the 10 days, technical assistance costs $1.29 a minute, plus the cost of the long distance call!
I REPEAT!  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!

Ever since Adobe bought out this small operation, customer service has been severely lacking.  Software will NOT work on Excel 2007.   The promise for additional POWERLOOKS has become dead.  Granted that the program makes presentation more interesting, the Powerlooks that was in production are no longer on the website.  This is highly disappointing as I purchased this program in anticipation for further development on the Powerlook templates.

First, I should have listened to my instincts and downloaded the trial version BEFORE purchasing.  Had I done this I would HAVE NEVER purchased this product.  As it is, having bought the product from a box store and NOT online, I made a $99.00 mistake, plus tax.  

The product has too many limitations to be considered as a viable add-on to your powerpoint presentations.  As a presenter, using PPT every week, in training presentations, I can tell you that this product does more to limit PPT's slide producing capabilities than it does to add to them.  As a matter of fact, I found the product to "take away" from PPT's slide building procedures, NOT "add" to them.  

Save your money and wait for the next PPT add-on to come along.  This product is worth neither your investigative time, nor your monetary investment

They changed pretty much everything. For starters they completely removed all of the normal menus such as File, Tool, and Edit. Which means you can't use the keyboard for quick and easy menu access. Well maybe you can, but you would have to memorize all of the commands instead of having the nice little visual cues which made previous versions of Office (and almost all other PC programs) so much easier to use. You basically have to use the mouse for everything. And in my experience there is no faster way to repetitive stress injury than over-mousing.

The Ribbon is just awful. First of all it's huge. It takes up about FOUR TIMES the space of my customized toolbar. They place nearly every button imaginable on it. And as far as I can tell you can't change it around or simplify it. Every function is displayed all the time whether you need it or not. Which makes finding anything a real pain in the neck. You can make the ribbon retract which at first glance seems nice. But in reality it turns what used to be simple 1-click operations into 3-click operations (extend ribbon, spend several minutes searching for button, click button, retract ribbon). Good grief! What a pain.

This software didn't last 24 hours on my system before I restored my old version of Office. This new interface is about the most awful thing I've ever seen on a computer. I know of certain free open source office suites that I prefer to this monstrosity. That being said I still prefer any and all previous versions of MS Office to the free one. In fact I would rather be using my old Wordperfect from 1995 than this *thing* that MS is trying to shove down our throats. If only I hadn't thrown that disc away six years ago...

Before you "invest" your money in this software I strongly recommend you download the free trial version. Then buy an earlier version

You will probably be more productive and less bug ridden if you stick with what you have. 
Don't expect to turn this version on and be able to use it. Many changes are literally imposed on you, like the ribbons instead of the familiar icon bars. Missing menus and the auto-double space setting every time you hit return. 
There are new features which can be helpful to some, but Microsoft probably thinks you can afford a week for retraining. 

The arrogance of Microsoft not even to offer the menus everyone is used to as a classic or traditional option is incredible. 
You upgrade for hundreds of dollars to get totally stuck and run out to buy a manual.

Far from user-friendly, you will be at the office later at night tearing out your hair trying to find the buttons on the tool bar for even the simplest of office tasks, wondering "Why did I get this program again?" Its like reading another language after using previous editions of Word, which I was a big fan of. I guess with some extensive getting used to the it might be nice but for now it's a nuisance. I can't find anything on this toold bar that looks like an airplane cockpit. In the words of Thoreau "Simplify."
Good luck sending files as attachments to colleagues-they won't be able to view the newere version. Get used to saving in "97-2003 Word Format." Also, won't comply with other programs such as e-fax unless saved in this manner. At this price, you could do without the headache.

We are very disappointed in this product because it provides almost no options to customize the spreadsheet.  We cannot rename catagories that are not applicable to us (i.e., child care), and we cannot create new categories that are specific to our needs.  What's even more limiting and disppointing is that you cannot create a different tab for each month to use for comparison, which makes us wonder what value we gain from having a single month of finances captured.  Finally, the bar graphs for summary comparisons are shaded the same color of the background which makes it very difficult to read

I have used Norton Virus Protection and Norton Internet Security for several years. I am currently running NIS 2006. My experience with these products has not been good but out of fear I just renewed my subscription. Since then I have had nothing but trouble with NIS. Since my renewal is within the grace period I decided to request a refund. I tried to do this on-line but found it an impossible waste of effort. Their web site and support are as useless as their product. From Norton Internet Security I clicked on support linked to their web site. Once there, I tried to apply for a refund but their system did not recognize my subscription renewal order number.  It did recognize my product order number for NIS 2006 but that is not refundable so no help there. I gave up on requesting a refund and decided to contact support. If you click on "contact us" There are 2 options, Telephone or Email. Telephone support was down because of an earthquake in Taiwan. I decided to try email. I clicked on email and got the following security alert: 
There is a problem with this website's security certificate.
The security certificate presented by this website has expired or is not yet valid.

Security certificate problems may indicate an attempt to fool you or intercept any data you send to the server. 
We recommend that you close this webpage and do not continue to this website. 
 Click here to close this webpage. 
 Continue to this website (not recommended). 
How ironic is that? I know I was on their site because I navigated there by clicking on support in NIS. You would think an internet security company could maintain their own security certificates. I'm not surprised though because everything Symantec does is designed to make you hate them. Their product is abysmal. It bogs my system down to a crawl, disrupts the performance of other applications and hogs system resources. If you put NIS on your computer you'd better get used to staring at the hourglass icon for long periods of time, Especially if you don't have tons of virtual memory and hard disk space available. Nortons CCapp retards start up forever and won't shut down when you want to log off. Recently I had to reinstall my windows xp operating system. After that I had major problems with NIS and had to uninstall it. It was then I realized how much better my system ran without it. I had already paid my renewal fee so I downloaded and reinstalled NIS and have had nothing but trouble since. I tried to leave feedback on Symantecs web site but typical of them, that does not work either. I wrote a long complaint, then clicked on submit. An error message came up saying to go back and correct the highlighted areas. When I clicked the back button all the text I had typed in was gone... just because I had failed to enter a subject line in the feedback report. I'll be damned if I was about to type all that information back in again. If you buy NIS you'd better hope it works the first time. If you think your going to get good support from Symantec or anything out of their website - think again. Oh, and BTW Beware, Symantec enrolls you for automatic renewal unless you go to their website and un-enroll. Once they have your money just try to get it back. Symantec sets up road blocks so you eventually just give up in frustration. This is how they make their money rather than by making a good product.

I have been using Norton Anti-Virus since I purchased the Compaq Presario 4000. The reason I have stuck with Norton because this Presario came with Norton Internet Security 2002 attached to it. I never used the NIS 2002, though, but I purchased the Norton Anti-Virus (NAV) 2003 which I have bee using for the last three years. In fact I used the NAV 2004 for two straight years without any response from Symantec, then all of a sudden that subscription was eventually retired by Symantec. I liked the NAV 2005 (which Symantec six months prior to its due date subscription, which made me mad and hence my wanting to try NIS at a subsidized rate) because like NAV 2003, it could tell if someone or something was trying to intrude into your computer. It is after purchasing and trying NIS 2005, that I realized how low and base Norton can go with its software. First when I tried NIS 2005, it blocked all my websites. I couldnt access them and I could not read my e-mail (Whenever I tried to read my e-mail, the response would be that, that action has been cancelled). So I reformatted my hard drive and the NIS 2005 appeared to be working quite well until I tred to install Adobe Reader 7.08 and couldn't allow me to proceed. Moreover, it was snail slow in allowing me to read one mail to another. So I uninstalled NIS 2005 and installed NAV 2006, which appears to be working well. I have now purchased Tend Micro PC-cillin 2006 as well as McAfee Viruscan 2006 at subsidized rates, should Symantec pematurely terminate my NAV 2006 prematurely i.e. before the 366 days of subscription are over. I think one of the reasons why NIS could not work is that it is a program that it is trying to do more than it can chew. It tried to be an anti-virus, personal firewall, privacy control, antispam as well as parental control in one. It reminds of the days when it was better to purchase a cassette player separate from  the radio, since the technology at that time could not produce a good combined raio cassette player. I think Norton Internet Security is in that mode. It is not yet competent to produce a combined solution that is both antivirus and anti spam,anti-spyware at the same time. Hence the many complaints of its being a buggy program. At this stage, I would stay away from any program that calls itself "Internet Security." I may try Trend Micro internet Security which has received rave reviews from a couple of its users, but that will be if something goes wrong with my current NAV 2006. Otherwise, I am still wary of those programs that pass off as "Internet Security" such as "Norton Internet Security" or "Trend Micro Internet Security," pending their perfection of this technology at some future date

Okay... so I'm not as astute in the technical aspects of software as some reviewers, but I can say that my experience with this software is absolutely terrible.

First off, it is built to integrate with Outlook, but doesn't really. It always leaves one e-mail in your outbox (the one you posted first). If you open your outbox before they send, then the one you posted most recently won't send either. Seriously, the only way I have been dealing with this is that I have left a dead e-mail in the box permanently. If I need to change something that has been posted to the outbox, I have to open it, then get out of the outbox, change it, and repost it, otherwise it won't send -- ever.

I have set NIS so that it doesn't scan my outgoing e-mail, as it blocks anything over 2mb, and in my business, I send things that big all the time. In a recent update, however, it has reinstated that and now scans all of my outgoing e-mail whether it is set to or not.

I spent hours and hours on the phone with (supposed) technicians, who refused to answer any questions unless I disabled my whole network. What that has to do with this program, I don't know. I tried the "live internet chat" function, but -- and I kid you not -- it took almost two hours for me to get ten responses from the guy. When I complained, he hung up on me. Gotta love that.

When I tell NIS that something it has categorised as spam "isn't spam", it doesn't remember the sender's e-mail address, like it is supposed to. It just keeps calling it spam and quarantining it. 

Regarding spyware, I have another piece of anti-spyware software called Webroot Spy Sweeper, that routinely finds spyware on my computer that NIS didn't catch. 

This has just been one headache after another. Their customer service was unresponsive and totally unhelpful, with not ONE actual solution to any of these problems.

The only piece of software I have ever bought that was anywhere close to as bad as this is WinFax 10, another Norton product.

I will NEVER, EVER buy another piece of Norton/Symantec software again as long as I live. They should be ashamed of themselves

(this review is of the Spyware edition)
NIS takes 25Megs of ram - ok for an all-in-one (if you have &lt;256Megs your lightweight CPU can't carry enough armor to make Windows really Zero-day Net safe IMHO)

NIS has most of the features I look for in a firewall/spyware/virus scanner/intrusion detector, BUT 
half don't work right, and some that do seem to fight every attempt to make them work.

Even after LiveUpdate this week,
One buggy automatic firewall rule autoloaded, and port 80 was open listening half 'naked' on the Internet.
I replaced it, and at the first passing probe my rule was erased, autoreplaced, naked again.
Only after I stumbled onto the secret trick (add a block all rule after the pass rules) did it close it.
It took 11 clicks (!) just to add the block all rule - miserable!
The log is a nightmare - pages of long sentences explaining "permitted once" 200 times, no actual info
	until I click on one of them. What's worse is, none of them I checked WERE "permitted once" IIRC.

NIS detected 2 trojan/spywares, but could not remove either.

Enabling program component monitoring started an avalanche of popups, all suggesting I block access, but I actually DO want IE to access the internet. 
Running Windows update brought a popup asking if 100's more dll's are ok. How would I know? I do want Windows updated. 
Great feature in theory, totally useless even if you know the names of every evil dll not yet invented.

If you have more than 1 or 2 programs not in the automatic ruleset, plan to either "permit all" or spend many hours actually writing the same set of 3 rules over and over for every autoupdating program you use - assuming you understand TCP vs UDP etc. Why no "permit all local + DNS + outbound port 80" choice? That would mean 1/10 the work! Jetico lets me pick "web browser" ruleset, so its UI from Hell gets used once per category.

After spending all day and half the night getting it working, I discover that it is not possible to save my precious rules - or to reload them. I would be less furious if I had a fresh install of windows, but not much.

All good, until a program autoupdates, and 3 more rules to write. Too angry for words.
Jetico lets me clone the old rules or edit them to update the program sig.

I would not use NIS if you paid me 10 times its price.

The Good- This software completely locks down email access, internet access, network access etc.

The Bad - This software completely locks down email access, internet access, network access etc.  

The UGLY.  I bought a new notebook I was going nuts trying to figure out why Outlook wouldn't send/receive emails, my wireless connection wouldn't work, why new software I was installing wouldn't update over the web, it was taking 5-10 minutes JUST TO RESTART THE COMPUTER!!! Hmmm all these issues started after installing Internet Security 2005.

To be fair I said ok, better make sure I have this set up right...So I took a step back, went to Symantec's site and spent time learning to properly configure the settings, software etc.  Ok great, my bad right?  Wrong.  When I tried adding Comcast's server addresses to the trusted list NIS 2005 would freeze up, I would have to reboot, and 10min later the same thing. 

To make a long story short, I would not reccomend this product for anyone with less than 110% of patience and complete understanding of the product installation and set up.  The best thing about NIS 2005 was it only took 5 minutes to uninstall.

I have always used Norton antivirus, and had no problems with it at all. I have recently had to migrate to Outlook 2003 and Norton IS 2005 and have non-stop system crashes. I have now uninstalled it and resinstalled my old version of Norton Professional and hey presto everything is working again - and not talking two hours to load.

I have always used the other well-known office suites in the past but when I received an offer on this suite at a significant discount, I thought I would try it.  I should mention I'm a doctoral student in the middle of a dissertation, so the challenge was to migrate important data and documents into WordPerfect and Quattro Pro.  While I was able to get it done the Quattro Pro interface with SPSS, which had worked seemlessly with the other spreadsheet, failed horribly.  Not to mention the complicated details of what should be simple document formatting--the Visual Basic Editor kept freezing or denying me access.

Invest in a better product if you have serious work.  I've gone back to the benchmark office suite product

Quicken software continues to contain prominent advertising for Intuit products and services.  In my opinion, it is fine to offer additional services to customers, but give the customer the opportunity to say "no thanks" and then leave them alone so they can be productive with the software.  Forever pestering a paid customer with advertising for the same products and services is not a good idea.  Advertising takes up space in the user interface and is a distraction that reduces productivity

I've only had this software for a few months and already know half of the tech support population of Bangalore, India. One problem with this software is that it has an auto update function that results in "Patch Engine Error," which I've solved through versions 2, 3 and 4. Another problem is with Quicken's servers, resulting in CC-501, CC-502 and CC-899 errors. Translation: Quicken's servers are unable to reliably update your bank account information. Today, in the time it took Pandeep to respond to one of my online chat questions, I was able to migrate a dozen accounts to MSN's free online version of Money, which updated all of my bank accounts easily. Conclusion: Save your receipt for their 60-day refund

I have been a long time user and have always had good success until the 2007. 

I have tried to install on my new PC and have not been successful. I called Intuit Phone support and spent and hour changing setting on my computer. We did the usual things for WinXP Pro:

1. Set up a new account to verify it isn't a permission problem
2. Shut off all service and switched to safe mode

None of these made a difference. So the Support Technician told me to call Microsoft and then hung up. That was it, no chance to even complain, just a dead phone line.

Luckly, I know enough to put my PC back in worki9ng order but this is pretty lame support. 

I never though Microsoft would get me to switch and they haven't but Intuit has forced me off all on their own.

From my experience just about all support calls are routed off shore.
Most of the tech support staff just take your question and type it into their work station. They say "May I put you on hold while I check my resources". Then they read answers off their screen. Several times I had to say to the tech - I can't understand your English. If you buy the package I'd find a local QB certified accountant and pay him/her for their time.

When converting my 2005 data over to 2006 version it lost all of my time data.  I have to rebuild my datafile just to use the check register now.  Also the new program will not allow me to add a vendor or a customer.  I've had to change names and addresses of obsolete customers and vendors just to add new ones.
Intuit's support sucks and cannot seem to resolve my problems.  I have two copies on two different computers and am having the same problems with my data file on each computer.  My recommendation is if you are using the 2005 version, and don't need tax tables, don't mess with 2006 version.  It has literally cost me thousands of dollars of my time trying to work out the bugs on my own

The res on the artwork here is less than miserable. The interface is high-tech circa 1996. 

I'm dissappointed in this purchase. I would have thought it was fantastic when I bought my first PC in 1993

I've installed and tested this for several clients.  Whether backing up to a local HD or over the network, the system has worked; I install and come back a week later to do a test verify and restore, and it's always worked.  I did have trouble once; Windows froze up.  This was probably due to poor programming combined with insufficient RAM; it worked the second time.

I don't get why a product with mostly single star ratings like this still gets 2.5 stars.  Annoying Amazon 'feature'!

Since 60% of Windows PCs are malware-infected, I'm figuring most Windows PC support issues are malware-induced.

It's a piece of junk, so save your money and some headaches. Even Dell technicians can't fix it.   My new Dell computer had Norton Ghost pre-installed with a back-up hard drive just for cloning.  It sounded like a perfect setup except my Norton Ghost wouldn't work.  Contacted Dell three times and they supposedly coordinated with Norton to no avail.  Now I'm stuck with saturated backup hard drive that is useless to me

I should have listened to the other reviewers...  I wanted to replace my C: drive with a faster one, and Ghost 10.0 says it can do it, but don't be fooled.  Even if you follow the extra steps from their support site (which are not in the documentation), you will end up with an unusable copy that will boot up but then fail with assorted catastrophic errors.

It will also give you occasional error messages that are neither in the documentation nor on their support site.

A friend recommended Acronis TrueImage which I ended using instead.  It's much easier to use, copies about 2x faster than Ghost, and best of all it works.  I cloned and replaced C drives from two laptops in a couple of hours with no problems.

Don't waste your time and money!! EXTREMELY poor product support! 60 day return policy which they exploit by trying to solve your problems and delaying past the 60 day limit, then you're stuck with worthless software.
I installed it on my computer making a complete backup of it. Then my computer crashed and I lost everything. I thought I was covered since I just made a full backup on an external hard disk but when I tried to do a restore Norton Ghost wouldn't recognize my external hard disk.
I spent a full day with their support people and he finally gave up telling me he had to send the problem to the next level of support and that they would call me within 48 hours. Nobody called!
I bought their Extended Download service and tried to download the product again. It didn't work and after spending 8 hours online and on the phone I still haven't got a working copy. The product key they said I needed and I tried to use also doesn't work. I'm writing my credit card company next to try and get a credit but I expect the same result - NO credit back and software that doesn't do what Norton said it would do

I got Norton Ghost with my new Dell PC, so I thought I would use it for backups to an external USB drive. After about 6 months of 'trying' to use it, I finally gave up and uninstalled it. Reason, most of the backups somehow get corrupted and the software seems to have trouble working with it. Twice I removed all the partial backups and started from scratch, but again after a few weeks the backup agent would hang while doing an incremental backup.

Now, the software is good for making a complete clone of the hard disk or restoring system from an image, but it does not seem to work well with incremental backups

I have used this procuct in the past with great success, but Ghost 10 is useless. Symantec tech support is (as far as I can tell, been doing computers since 1957) the worst. If you get the Boxed version It says PC Magzine September 2004 "Belongs in every serious PC user's toolbox."  Think about it using a 2004 quote. In 2004 and 2005 I would agree.  The 1st sys I installed Ghost 10 is a Dell XPX600, Boot disk will not work, BackUp will not work, blue screen when backing up.
Tech support directed me to web sites that don't exist, and the sites that did come up didn't have the files NU tech listed.  Dell Workstations 530 and 360 both dual processor, no games, 15,000 Scsi Raid, 4GB mem, 1GB nVidia, Dual Displays -- They Crashed and had to be reformated and reinstalled. System works 2005 expired I couldn't use my Ghost 9 backups, and I kept getting virus pop ups that were generated by NU, the systems were shipped to Panama and were in Customs for over 6 mo this is not a usual event in the life of a computer, but with no tech support and my computers only starting long enough to tell me Sys Works was not up to date I reformated. I purchased (in anticipation of setting up my computers) boxed from Amazon and download from NU Ghost 10,Sys Wrks prem, NU int sec (2007 versions) but couldn't install them. That was Mid December 2006, now its January 19, 2007 and still not one answer from NU that works, yes all systems are pluged in to  TrippLite Smart3000RMU & TrippLite line condidtoners (2 Batery Backup Units), the computers lived in ST Maarten and the power was 105 to 140 volts with lots of downtime.
Panama weather, people, public offices are great (Driver lic $24 Lic plates $30 for 3 years, St Maarten driver lic $450 for 2 years, Lic plates $400 yr) sailing is better in ST Maarten. Life in Panama ( and I don't speek Spanish yet )is good Norton is bad. l read a lot mostly tech books, I purchase tools, electronic gear, software, computer hardware, etc without Amazon it would be hard to live offshore,no need to go to Borders, Amazon is online 24 7.

I bought this for my two sons, ages 6 and 8, to help them develop speed with their memory math skills.  What a disappointment.  Even when they do know the answer quickly it can take them a good minute to find the actual answer in the game.  Each playtime you must start from the beginning a work back up to where you left off.  Good for review but it takes so long to get to the levels where practice is really needed.  I wish I'd purchased a different product

This concept is good but the user interface and playability is terrible.  My 7-year old was frustrated with being forced to use the keyboard and no mouse.  And we couldn't figure out a way to go back to the main menu without exiting the game.  And playing a later level requires you to go through all the earlier levels.  And...did they actually test this thing on humans?  What a waste of potential.  It is a good concept

My son had an earlier version of Math Blaster, it was wonderful.  I saw this new version and expected more of the same.  WRONG!!  After 10 minutes of loud sounds, and pulsing video, he was complaining.  It was impossible to focus on what he should do with all the distracting background stuff. Never could get to a point where learning might take place.  Wish I could get my money back.  

After this disaster, we purchased Mia's Math Adventure. This was more in tune with the first Math Blaster.

I just got a 2006 version of math blasters, I played it for a while and I thought that it was really frustrating and it didnt help me at math at all! I think that anyone who plays it will probably fall right to sleep when they start playing! The box it came in said it was for age 6-12 but I think it is for 6 or 7 year old kids. I really dont think this is a good game to play

If I had $1 for every time a CS2 app crashed and made expend real hours to redo work, I'd have about $10. And that's enough for me to say, BEWARE of this set of applications! Adobe has allowed them to get too bloated, too slow, and the results are that all the programs (but principally GoLive, InDesign and Illustrator, in that order) are crashy and will quite suddenly, forcing you to expend the precious hours of your life redoing work you just finished. I cannot stress how disappointed I am in Adobe, and how distraught I am that we as a nation have allowed the only two competing companies to join, thus guaranteeing that there will be less quality and innovation in the future. In any event, do not buy the CS2 apps, Adobe does not deserve your support

We purchased this software to map retail locations on a region.  It is missing too many features to be usable.  For instance, when you import a custom graphic pushpin, the software doesn't resize it as you zoom which forces you to create multiple sizes in another program.  You can add text description boxes but have no control over the font or sizing -- and they don't resize either.  

We highlighted our specific region but the software doesn't let you print just that region (called 'territory.)  We searched the help files and their word 'territory' is not even listed.

You cannot save your map graphics in any standard graphics format, e.g. JPEG, PDF or ai.  We tried printing to a PDF generator, but Map Point's map output is of very poor resolution even on the highest settings.

After wasting a lot of time, it's apparent we should have tried Google Maps/Earth with our graphics editing software for a solution that works

If you buy this be sure to set a Restore Point before installing. This may work if you have never installed any other Anti-Virus software. This is not for a novice computer user to install unless maybe you are installing on a brand new computer.

After uninstalling Norton (my previous anti virus software)I installed Kapersky and immediately had total system lockup with warning message from Windows (the old blue screen of death) saying a serious problem had occurred and if I had recently installed new hardware or software to uninstall it.  Which I did, then logged onto the Kapersky forum and was told to download a Norton Removal tool and run it and then reinstall.  I did this and still ended up with total lockup and warning message.  After three tries I gave up.  Luckily I had set Restore points and was able to get my system back and am now back to using Norton.  According to the forum there are also problems if you have installed McAfee.  I am running Windows XP.  Since I never got to use it I can't judge whether it has any value.

I have this program on a 30-day demo.  It might be OK if I didn't mind my computer becoming almost unusable.

I tried to run the system virus scan, as recommended, but after 3 hours it was only 2% done because it was stuck on a file it couldn't seem to get past.  I skipped the file, but then it quickly got stuck again.  The "time remaining" said it would take 4 days to complete, so I cancelled that scan.

It has a learning mode that initally blocks EVERYTHING.  Apparently, this program has no brain.  For example, I have the Live Search Toolbar installed in Outlook.  It had to ask me if it was OK to run that dll file.  In fact, each program that called up a process from a shared dll has to ask permission before it could run.

Don't even get me started on the Quickbooks and Internet Explorer problems.  Which is what it wouldn't let those programs do, even after they had been run and I repeated clicked "allow" over and over.

Twice today it got so slow running IE that it finally crashed the computer so bad that  I had to do a hard re-boot.  If you have it checking ports on your computer, almost nothing would run or download on IE.

So, I'm going to demo a few more, but it's probably back to Windows Live OneCare, which I had the past year.  It just doesn't seem to do much (no long list of features), but it also doesn't jam everthing else up

If I could give it 0 star, I would. My humble opinion is that Kaspersky is not better than Norton at slowing down your computer. One brand new computer, plenty of space and memory. One old computer but with plenty of space and memory as well. Each time Kaspersky updates, I can't open Outlook Express nor Explorer. Well, the programs do open actually but I have time to vacuum and dust before they're launched. I used the repair fonction and uninstalled and reinstalled without any improvement.

After researching a few options on the market I tried Kaspersky Internet Security Suite 6.0. I needed only anti-virus but since the rebates made the whole suite cost the same as anti-virus alone I decided to give it a try. Man, I was really disappointed. Out of 7 programs only 2 started and have been working properly: anti-virus and proactive defense. The suite was trying to start other 5 programs and was requesting to reboot laptop constantly. After trying all I could I decided to call or email for help. And this is where I got my surprise - none of the contact information led me to any LIVE person. I emailed to all addresses available on the net and in the program. I called all US numbers I could - they even don't have a live representative here. If you try to call a number for US and Canada you will reach one of those accept all calls and leave your numbers with wait all you can for response time. I filled out two bug reports directly from the program with the same result.
One of the selling points of anti-virus program was HOURLY updates. Well, guess what. You are lucky to have a DAILY update without a manual interaction. I thought that something is wrong with my work laptop and installed second program (I was nave and bought two) on a BRAND new installation of Windows XP. Result was ABSOLUTELY identical.
If you don't believe me - try to contact ANY of their support (not SALES) channels BEFORE you buy their product. My final view on this product would be:
1.	Great idea
2.	Maybe great initial implementation (the reviews were great)
3.	And UNAVAILABLE SUPPORT. 

Don't waste your time and money

Before buying, I downloaded and installed a 30-day trial version of KIS 6.0.  First, I uninstalled Windows Live One Care.  After installing KIS 6.0 and rebooting, my Windows XP Home Edition computer just locked up.  Had to go through Safe Mode to remove the program via Windows Explorer, since Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel will not work in Safe Mode.
When I reinstalled Windows Live One Care, it offered to remove the remains of KIS 6.0 that I couldn't. 
Next, Internet Explorer 7 would not work at some sites.  Had to call Microsoft Support and a great technician in India took about an hour to straighten out the damaged files in IE7 at no charge.  Thanks a lot, Kaspersky!
Now, my computer is working fine.  I am sorry that I did not have a chance to use KIS 6.0, but I will stick with One Care and renew it when my 1st year of free updates expires soon

Based on lots of great reviews, I decided to buy Kaspersky.  After two months, I got a message saying my activation key was blacklisted.  I sent an email to customer service and got an auto reply saying they were too busy to respond within 48 hours.  Finally after three days someone got back to me and told me to try deleting and reentering the key.  This did not work.  I had to reply again to customer service and got the same auto reply. This time, no one ever replied.  I sent another email threatening to write negative reviews of them and they still, weeks later, have not replied.  I emphatically advise against buying this product.  If you ever have a problem, you will not get help

At first I thought the idea of offering a set of the most popular applications at an affordable price was great. Recently, however, many computer makers have started using MS Works as the standard pre-loaded suite on new machines.

Users who need more than very very basic features will need to buy more dependable software packages(e.g. MS Office). The word processor in Works, for instance, does not have many macrons that are commonly used in Dutch, Scandinavian, Turkish, romanized Russian, Japanese etc.. In the end the low price of MS Works is a way to save money to computer makers and to squeeze out extra money from buyers who will need to upgrade to better products anyway

I started writing code for the web back when you could still order it as a text only service.  DOS ruled the day, and there were no ads plastered on every site.  This is the first product that takes HUGE STEPS BACKWARD in useability, functionality, and performance since the public birth of the web.  Unlike the previous reviewers glowing account of AS 4000 I am looking at new software because the service that this company provides and their complete lack of a proactive nature with regard to its useability have rankled me one too many times.  To wit:

1.  I am running a dual core 3.0 with 1 gb of memory and the 3d draw is slower that previous versions.
2.  Tech support had the audacity to tell me that going to a drop down menu to rotate an item selected is faster than a right click of the mouse and a context menu that would allow me to do the same from that menu.  This is a step backward of at least 10 years.  Previous versions had the right click menu which also had delete and other frequently used commands available.  Really piss poor on their part to eliminate this feature alone.
3.  Despite a fast newer machine, once you select an item you have to wait before you can move it by selecting it a second time.  Pitiful.
4.  Won't import standard dxf files without saving them as one layer.  Making a product that won't play nice with others is a bad thing.

I have other issues, but just don't want to spend any more time on this company or their products.  If I ran my business and failed to listen to my customers like punch, I would be out of business.

Bottom line:  NO LONGER RECOMMENDE

The graphics are clear, but they are bad! Horses look nothing like that and it is really gross! I would say get it for the younger kids, because they won't care.

There is nothing to do with the game except earn money, build your hotel, and keep your horse from getting sick. You don't get to ride that often because it said "you have ridden enough for this round" and it is very enoying. you can't pay enough monay to keep more than one horse, but you need to jump them to earn money so you can build your hotel / parking lot / jumping corse / breeding paddock / ect. But you can't do that unless you can jump the horse alot, and you can't. It is easy to go 'bankrupt' so I would say this game is not for little kids because of the money dealing.

not for older kids because of the dumbness of the horses look, not for younger kids because of the money problems.
So don't get this game

If you have an older systemworks loaded, NSW will go to remove the older GO BACK version.  If it does, (depending on your system) OK.  However, if it wants you to go to Symantek web site and download a GO BACK removal toll, beware.  I downloaded it and ran it and it stated it wanted to restart my system.  What it did was screw up the partition and crashed the system.  GO Back puts your data in a seperate partition.  Symantek knows about this and has a "fix" you run before loading NSW, but they didn't let anyone know that it may crash your system.  On an older PC, without windows restore tool, it works OK.  However, if you have a newer PC with a windows resotre loaded and then have an older NSW GO back loaded, it will crash your PC if you use their GO Back removal tool.  Emailed Symantec twice, they stated they would get back in 7 days - never did.  Hope you have better luc

The new Systemworks has a horrible interface.  You can't see what your options are easily.  You can't see the status of your components.  You can't see what version you have.  When you load it after loading Norton Personal Firewall 2006, the Firewall will not load program rules (you have to uninstall the Firewall and then reinstall it).  I'm not sure how the protection works, but the software "redesign" was done by an ergonomic moron

I have used System Works on my computer since 2000. The 2007 version is nowhere as good as the older ones. They have deleted many of the "real" diagnostic features (Registry Optomizer), dummed down the rest, and added (rather forced) an auto-load Norton Protection Center that takes over the Windows Security Center and cannot be easily unloaded. Software should be made to be user-friendly ... this version is nothing like the previous ones

The software installation is buggy.  It try's to download the entire installation from the SnapStream web site, even though there is a installation disk included.  If your web connection fails the installation trashes your system and you will need to reinstall Windows.  I have Windows XP SP2 with a flakey internet connection. Although I am computer literate, after two attempts to install this product I have chucked the whole thing out the window. P.S. SnapStream has no tech service department to speak of

After 25 years of building PC, and installing software, beta testing software, I am unable, even with Adobe's technical support staff to install Acrobat Version 8.  Software gets to the end of the install process and stalls.  No combination of repair, uninstall, reinstall, registry cleaning, advice from THREE technical support staff after hours on the telephone can solve the problem.  Using XP, with all the latest upgrades, defragging the drives, with 2 MB RAM, and a Adobe Tech support clean registry still fails to properly install the software.

I use Adobe Acrobat Professional extensively both as an attorney and as a researcher/author.  Because of the new features advertised which would enhance Acrobat storage of PowerPoint presentations, I bought it off the shelves at a local Staples office supply dealer.  I am proficient at my own installations and expected no trouble on this.  It acted like a virus.  The program did not finish installing.  Worse yet, it corrupted the underlying 7.0 installation and fixed that so the Windows Controller program could not install it. I had to hack through the registry to remove traces of it.  Finally I got to a stage where it appeared to be going through the registry process again.  Then I received the coup de grace -- a BAD SERIAL NUMBER MESSAGE.  I checked carefully and it matched the serial number exactly as on the label sent by Adobe inside its factory package.  I used MicroSoft OneNote to make a colored screen copy of this phenonema and marched the package back to Staples where they refunded my money.  It's too bad about the 20 plus billable hours as a lawyer lost to this process.  My experiences in calling Adobe in the past when I puzzled through a far lesser discourage me from wanting to talk to their technical support people (who too often know less than me given the increasingly apparent out-sourcing to people who read from a script and give us credit for knowing far less than we do).  At any rate, I am now bitter.  My 7.08 installation of Adobe worked great on my favorite computer where I had the bulk of my multimedia presentations which I hoped to reduce complete with sounds to the Adobe 8.0 format.  I suspect that wrong serial numbers were slapped on the packages.  I am deeply disappointed, even ANGRY at the inconvenience this has caused me.  I took it home and tried it on my desktop there and it also would not complete the installation and ruined my chances of a clean uninstallation of 7.0.  Deactivation of 7.0 could not take place either after installation of 8.0.  I don't know what Adobe was thinking -- or if they were thinking.  I have been a loyal customer of theirs for many years, but I'm thinking distinctly non-charitable thoughts about them this early morning.  I hope they get their act together -- soon.  They owe us all a quick fix and patch and they need DEEP REPENTANCE for the damage this did to Windows XP home installations which also appear to be corrupted in the process of installing this "upgrade" program which acts more like a computer worm or virus than a program

After spending over an hour waiting on their help line and trying all of their non-functioning suggestions, I was still unable to install this on either of my PCs. They don't want to admit it, but their ad for Deduction Pro kills the software install at 21% (or 26% for the standard version). And no, their "font patch", killing all startup services, upgrading the Flash Player, nor starting in Safe Mode did not resolve the problem. I'm out the money on this and am switching to TurboTax. H&R Block has lost this customer.

I just input all the information for my return and this software has me owing over $8000.  By my calculations I'm owed a refund of $150-200.  It is not taking federal income tax already paid from annuities into account.  Back to the calculator for me

I just purchased the software and successfully installed it on my computer.  When I got to the point of entering dividends and capital gains, I couldn't figure out how to import the data from Fidelity that I've done for the last few years.  Looking around on the Fidelity website, I can across the following statement: "For the 2005 tax year, Fidelity information will not be able to be imported directly into H&R Block's TaxCut programs. H&R Block expects that these products will have this functionality restored for the 2006 tax year."  Unfortunately, this is the reason I'm using a software tax prep program, looks like it's back to TurboTax

I have had to set up a few new installs of the Vista Business on some servers and I was disappointed with the overall performance. 

My biggest gripe is when I tried to remotely log in from another PC and I sat there waiting and waiting only to discover that the Vista default setup is to ask permission to run even the most basic operations and was actually sitting there waiting for someone to click 'YES' to allow the process to run. How irritating! Kinda self defeats the idea of remotely logging in doesn't it?. 

Also if you happen to rename the administrator account the change is not registered somewhere in the Remote Connections authorization. So when I *thought* I was remotely logging in under the new admin account name Vista wouldn't let me in and it was only after searching for what seemed an eternity - some hidden place it took me 15 minutes to find, I discovered that the the new admin account name had not been authorized when I did the name change. yikes!

For those who need to run VNC Server on Vista, be aware there are issues -  installing and running that you will need to work around as well. 

It seems like Microsft drastically changed the menus, overdid the default security features, and installed a new hood ornament. Other than that I don't see what the big deal is.

I was required to purchase this with my new computer. I thought I'd give it a chance at work. We have a dedicated wired network, which just requires that you register the machine's MAC address with our DHCP server. Nice and simple, and very much like the LAN in any home where the user has a NAT router.

I plugged in the network and tried to get the MAC address. Vista would only give me the wizard to connect my network. OK, I tried the wizard. It offers to let me setup PPPoE with a username and password. That's it, no other options. I asked for other options, and it only offered that I use a modem (that I did not have in my computer.) No options for a dedicated network at all, that I could find.

I went to another machine (on the 'net) and searched Google. None of the Microsoft sites were helpful in any way. Lots of PR posturing, but no useful information or troubleshooting.

I gave up, found the license and install disks for Windows XP, and downgraded the new machine. It was far, far easier.

You can get Mac OS X for 129 bucks and it has everything as opposed to the Microsoft's 227 dollar Home Premium which is the low end. Buy Mac and get all the functionality in one OS. When spec'ed out the system are comparable in price, except apple doesn't offer low-end hardware options which is why they seem more expensive

The upgrade is $75 cheaper and you DON'T need to have a previous install of Windows to get it to work. Simply do the following:

1. Boot with the Windows Vista Upgrade DVD.

2. Click "Install Now."

3. Do not enter a Product Key When prompted. 

4. When prompted, select the Vista product edition that you do have.

6. Install Vista normally.

7. Once the install is complete, restart the DVD-based Setup from within Windows Vista. Perform an in-place upgrade. 8. Enter your Product Key when prompted. 

This is according to Microsoft's internal documentation, and reported by Paul Thurrott at Windows IT Pro

I was a private beta tester for the new OS. I tested the software for a whole year and I am not pleased with it.

If you depend on stability for your existing software, you are out of luck. The hardware and software support for the new operating system is horrible. Many businesses will have to upgrade their hardware to use Windows Vista. 

You are better off upgrading to a Mac. After all, Microsoft did steal many ideas from Apple Computers.

I hate this product. Since I'm used to Office 2003 (at work), opening this program and having to look at the childish-looking menu bar was a shock. The layout is irritating, poorly designed, and does not provide sufficient features. To make things worse, this sorry program does not allow you to save files directly to CD. The one-star rating was too generous.

I have been a Microsoft Money user for many, many years. (Going back to Money '98? I forget.) I reluctantly upgraded to Money 2007 Premium earlier this year from Money 2004 when I read somewhere that Money 2004 was no longer going to be supported. (I also read that Money 2005, Money 2006, and Money 2007 had issues. Hence my reluctance to upgrade.)

For years, I have sync'ed Money with my online accounts on nearly a daily basis. I'm that kind of focused on keeping my eye on my money, and Money has historically served me very well in this habit. Money 2007 does not.

Since installing it, I have:
 
1) Battled with my prior bank for nearly two months to get them to figure out by Money 2007 does not synchronize with their systems. 

2) Installed and reinstalled Money 2007 on several different workstations to test the synchronization issue with my years-old Money file and new, empty Money files. Always fails.

3) Now I have *switched banks* thinking the syncing issue was my bank's fault. It wasn't. It's Microsoft Money's fault.

Syncing fails *every* time with a helpful OBRES 22063 error. Oh, yea, that 
one! We all know just what that is.

I have read every Microsoft knowledge base article I can find. I have perused public.microsoft.money and other usenet groups. I have Googled. I have read blogs. The only thing I find is that lots of people have this problem with lots of different financial institutions, and Microsoft is doing nothing about it

In Money 2004, this worked flawlessly nearly every time. Why did it 
break?!?!!

So if you're looking to have Money synchronize with your accounts online, look elsewhere. But if you're all about putting everything in manually, this product will serve you just fine.

Buy a copy of Quicken instead!

I bought this program because I wanted to use it on the pocket pc (DELL Axim X50v).  The program is very confusing to use.  It took some time to load on the PPC first, then you have to load the maps.  I tried to load the map of the whole state and it wasn't working. The map would come up and the gps reciever would pick up where I was, but when I would write an address of a street that exists, it would say "SEARCH DONE, NO MATCH FOUND."  I called the Delorme support many times, they helped me go through the application, but I feel that this application wont give me directions that I want off of the PPC.  

I should have bought the iguidance.  One of my friends has this application and it is awesome.  He loaded 3 states all at once and it gives you directions very easily.  There are many points of interest.
I particularly like the screen that shows you all the streets in a 3D fashion.  It is easy to use.

"DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE THAT I MADE, BUY THE IGUIDANCE OR TOMTOM SOFTWARE."

Unit gives inconsistant results especially with front projection sets.  Spyder also requires room to be as dark as possible in order to make adjustments.  This is not always practical.  The tripod mount fits too loose on Spyder and easily falls off.  I think this is a good beginning to a potentially fine product, but not yet ready for prime time

I am really thinking of returning it to Amazon. I think I will stick with good-'ol MS Word. You see I wanted a 12-page form and spent two days creating it. It's a form to survey boats so it also had graphic areas for photos (about 12). Well, all seemed fine until you printed a filled form to .pdf. The size of the created .pdf was near 10MB! (Similary done with MS word resulted in a 1.2MB finished .pdf). Well, I can't be e-mailing 10MB files!
I also recieved the book for the 5.0 filler which says it can use Dragon Naturally Speaking (I use that). I'll be darned if I can figure out where that tool is, "you must activate voice recognition in the tool bar." And, if you use Dragon Naturally Speaking in the form filler area all sentences start out without capital letters, say and select does not work. (I should note that Dragon Naturally Speaking works flawlessly in MS Word!) So, you manually have to go back and capitalize each sentence. Finally, as others have said, there is no FAQ and generally no troubleshooting help on the ScanSoft web site.  This is very poor for a near $100 product. There would be no way that I would spend $700 on their premium edition.

Do not buy anything from this company unless you will be able to return it within 20-30 days of the shipping date.  (The receipt says 20 days but the web site says 30 days.) You don't have much time to return an item, and the company does not give any leeway for Christmas orders.  I am stuck with the item my son did not want for his dorm room, and I can't exchange it for another item because he didn't like any of their products.

I bought this product on the strength of the Norton name, and a positive review in Business Week.    I uninstalled ZoneLabs, Ad-Aware, and all Norton anti-virus.  There were still NAV files after the uninstall.  I had to download their Norton Software Removal tool, which also could not remove some NAV files.   Everytime I re-boot, those problematic NAV files want to re-launch NAV.  

The NIS 2007 install was still difficult after all of that effort, and once installed NIS 2007 either freezes up my computer, or makes my internet connection so slow that it is un-usable.

So, now I've uninstalled NIS 2007, still have issues with the corrupt NAV files, and will being go back to ZoneLabs and Ad-Aware.

I have always used Norton products, and upgraded to IS 2007 when my
subscription came up for renewal. WHAT A MISTAKE. My computer
freezes up all the time, and the software is difficult to use- it is
not at all straightforward like previous versions of Internet Security.
Do not buy this product.

I bought this product because I thought Norton was a quality product. Man did I make a mistake buying this product. I only had it on my computer for 1 month and it made my computer crawl , almost to where it would not  hardly work. I deleted it . Then my computer starting working just fine. This happened to me 2 times before I got tired of it and trashed it.

I bought a new Desktop PC installed with Vista.  It came preinstalled with McAfee 2007.  I have been using Norton products for years, so I bought a 3 user package of North Internet Security 2007.  For the 60 days of the trial, my computer ran flawlessly.  But it was time to install Norton as McAfee had run its course.  I installed the program last night, which took 45 minutes with the Vista update from Symantec, required updates, restarts and the full system scan.  After this time my computer, which as I said ran flawlessly for 60 days, well now every 60 minutes I get the blue screen of death and a forced restart.  I contacted Symantec's customer support only to be greeted with an hour and forty five minutes wait to chat with an analysts (seems that I was not the only one with Norton troubles).   After all this time, the advice I was given was....uninstall and reinstall!!!!  Gee, Einstein, I would have never done that already before I wasted my time contacting you.  But the Symantec analyst was firm that this was the problem.  So I took my morning and uninstalled and reinstalled and...THE SAME BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH but now in under an hour of use!!!  I'm uninstalling this virus and buying a McAfee package ASAP.  

Oh also, during the time my computer was not crashing, it ran SLOW!!  It is a 2.8 gig processor with 2 gigs of ram but it ran as if it were a 386 processor with 32 megs of ram.  And everything you run, Norton needs you to approve its connection...EVERYTHING.  You can allow Norton to decide what can and cannot connect so you do not have to click every five second, but then you will not be able to user 1/2 of your programs as the geniuses at Norton did not include them in their `safe' list.
I regret buying this and only wish I could give it ZERO stars!!!

After years of using Symantec Norton Antivirus and related internet security products, the upgrade to 2007 seemed like a no brainier.  That was until the install started.  If you run into error 9999,171 you may as well give up, it is over.  

Following the Symantec directions for resolution of the dreaded 9999,171 error caused the entire windows XP install to be corrupt and necessitated reinstallation.  Believing that a reinstall was not all bad as it would clean up several old and no longer used software pieces and provide a clean base for installing Symantec I marched forward.  Once XP was installed and current with the patches it was time to install Symantec again.  No luck, I was still receiving the 9999,171 error.

Now it was time to get someone on the phone for support.  This is a good trick since Symantec does not readily publish a phone number for support.  The number by the way is 877-832-2810.  Be prepared for a long wait on hold.  During four support calls I experienced no less that 40 minutes on hold and the longest was over one hour.  Support is provided by offshore resources in India so not only are you fighting a technical problem you must also overcome the language barrier.

The four separate calls to support resulted in multiple steps to clean up old installs, prep for install, reboot, reinstall, hack through the registry, and oh yah corrupt windows XP again needing a second reinstall.  During the final call, the support rep finally gave up and indicated the Symantec could not be installed on this Windows XP machine.

I have since moved on to McAfee Internet Security Suite 2007.  The install took about ten minutes and I am now up and running again.

Norton is now owned by the huge behemouth Digital River, who haven't a clue how to run support or customer service.  They are useless and anything with their grimy mits on it and we take a wide berth of it, wouldn't consider it.  Norton used to be top notch, now it is like pouring mollasses into your computer.  It interferes with everything.  Microsoft seems to have given up on them too, as Norton has not bothered to interface properly with Windows, a consequence being that it is also buggy and problematic.  I can only warn you ~ AVOID!!!  A bad bit of software and a company that hasn't any clue about what customer service is and doesn't look likely to change.  Profit seems to be likely more important to them than service or keeping the Norton family of software up to date and working well...

This is my first public review of any product. I generally dont have the time or motivation to go throught the process of posting a review. However, I have never had such a negative experience with a commercially available software package before. From beginning to end, the process of repeated attempts to install and then trying to remove NIS2007 was time-consuming, frustrating, and crippled my computer. 

First the operating environment details. I'm running XP-Pro SP2 on a 2.6ghz pentium with 1GB of RAM. 

Upon the de-installation of the existing NIS 2006 and Spyware Doctor applications, I proceeded with the installation of NIS 2007. The installation appeared to go cleanly, but upon attempting to restart, my computer hung on shutting down, and upon attempting to come up, I got a blank desktop with no task bar, start menu, or desktop icons. Later, as I was working with Symantec support and was able to get a desktop back, I also experienced things as not being able to bring up the control panel or click on the 'My Computer' icon. Of course, I had no internet access during the whole ordeal. 

Since I couldnt find any phone number contact in the ridiculously minimal instruction manual that came with the package, I called my local ISP to find out what they knew about the affects of using NIS 2007. Through them I got a phone number for Symantec support. As a side note, the manual points out ways to get support if you have access to the internet and email, but gives no direction if you dont have access to those. 

Over the course of the next 4 days of working through my issues with NIS 2007, my experience with Symantec support left me with the impression that they were mostly incompetent and quite innefective. I give Symantec credit for having 24/7 phone support, and I did work with one knowledgable support person there named Jay, but most of the experience was frustrating and time-consuming. The help desk is located in India, and the first problem is that they couldnt hear me though I was speaking loudly. The next problem is that I had to answer the same questions repeatedly as if the person didnt understand my answers. On a number of ocassions, I felt the person on the other end was just going through a script, and wasnt listening to what I was saying or reading my growing case notes. I got passed around a lot to different people and spent a lot of time on hold. They kept trying to get me off the phone even though we hadnt worked through the problem completely. In one instance, the helpdesk person was trying to tell me that things were all fixed even when I had told her there was an activation error during the re-install we were working on. 

Having worked with tech support and edited registries, and tinkered with start-up configurations and various services settings, I could never get NIS 2007 to install (tried four times). Trying to un-install the package turned out to be almost as difficult and troublesome. Uninstalling has left me with problems with my computer I have yet to work out. I still cant use my scanner because it complains about a symantec DLL issue. I have no idea why that would be. 

Anyway, I would rate this product less than zero if I could. There was nothing that went right, and a lot that went wrong. I cant believe Symantec could put out such a pathetic piece of software with such inffective support. I'm returning NIS 2007 and trying my luck with Zone Alarm.

This product is horrifying. It worked for three months, at which point it experienced a complete meltdown. Started getting Auto-Protect errors, and suddenly could access the internet with Explorer, but not Firefox. It kept trying to send me to Live Update, which wouldn't work, so I uninstalled and reinstalled Norton. Now the error happened again, and I could access the internet with Firefox, but not Explorer. An error message referred me to an online "fix," but -- guess what! -- you can't access any of their fixes with Firefox. You MUST be using Explorer. (Which is, in and of itself, offensive and obnoxious.) Explorer, of course, wasn't working. (Incidentally, with Norton uninstalled, all worked fine, so that was indeed the source of the problem.) Uninstalled and reinstalled Norton again, hoping to get on Explorer and get the fix before the error recurred, but now I couldn't get on the internet AT ALL. At that point, I uninstalled Norton for good. Ditto on the fact that they don't support the product, apparently don't stand behind the product, and apparently aren't very concerned about their reputation. Very disappointing. Previous versions were just fine; this is a complete mess

Just terrible software.  Often does not work - if that would be the only thing it would be enough.  But it is worse than that.  Bogs down your computer big time.  Makes it run super slow.  Horrible.  Whoever has written good reviews must be shills for Norton.  Avoid.  Repeat.  Avoid

Bought System mechanic 6 pro online, it repairs but reports problems but you cannot get information at all. None of the modules report what is being done. If you need assistance forget it, all you get from IOLO is go see the FAQ's, I don't think humans work there just a computer that generates emails. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!!

After installing in Sony vgc-ra810 system crashed. Unable to find C:. Have been waiting two days for a legitimate answer from I0L0 and now have two case ##. Phone attempts are met with automated replys the same as the internet. The Amazon seller has been very helpfull so I can not blame him. If I ever get my computer running I plan on visiting all sites that support reviews with a word of advice about lack of HUMAN product support by IOLO. As for now I wanted to get this out to Amazon customers so I am using my neighbors computer

Save your money!!!

I used the evaluation version of System Mechanic version 6 for 29 days and thought it was great enough that I paid for and upgraded to System Mechanic Professional version on the subscription option for $69.95.

I download the installer and ran it at 7:30 am on Sunday morning.  None of the modules, I repeat NONE worked.  I uninstalled.  Cleaned out my registery and directories of all traces of this and the previous version and reinstalled, several time to the point that I gave up at 8pm the sam night.  I search the online support and found no help.  I wrote an email and as of today (Wednesday) have not yet received a reply.  Their phone is constantly busy but I did get through last night at 7pm eastern time (they close at 8pm eastern/5pm pacific) and was transferred to tech support.  For the next hour I listened to the message: "All of our support specialist are busy.  Please stay on the line and your call will be answered in the order in which it was received" until 8pm when the recording switched over to: "Thank you for calling Iolo.  Our business hours are from 9am to 5pm pacific time.  Please call back during these hours."

I'm extremely upset.  I'm not a noob and have been using computers since the 386 days.

As soon as my American Express bill cycles, I will call and have the charge removed.

Version 6 was great, version 7 tanks.

Save your money.  Spend it with a company who responds to their customers

Systemic Mechanic 6 seemed to be helping, since it handled a lot of the advertised functions well. 

However, the "repair broken shortcuts" function does not work properly.  

For a variety of reasons I use a large number of Microsoft Word Shortcuts in my Folder/ File  system.   System Mechanic "repaired broken shortcuts" on a large number of my short-cutted documents by directing the shortcut from the correct file target to the wrong file target.   Now I am pulling up documents which are similar ( but are actually older versions which I have save to an auxiliary hard drive ) or unrelated to the actual, correct target file. This has had severe productivity consequences,  since I have to double check the target of every file opened via a shortcut.

Contacting on-line Help was of no help whatsoever.

My daughter (13) and I tried The Number Devil together. She has ADD and has difficulty with math. We found the intro to be too long and the games boring.  This game did not keep her attention at all.  We also tried Math Blaster and would recommend that game instead. I am glad others have found this game helpful unfortunately it didnt for us.

I bought this software two days ago, Installed it on my laptop and all of a sudden, my network connection was messed up. I could not figure how to connect to the wireless or wired network. My other computers were still able to connect, so it was a problem with the computer with Fix It installed. After much work, I finally uninstalled the software and right away was able to get back on the network. I am not sure if there is some kind of firewall setting with the software, or if it was just the software itself.

Anyway, I am unsure whether to reinstall this software or not

This software might be recommended if better utilities weren't out there. This one gives the user a sense of security, but when my system crashed, Fix-It couldn't. I dutifully put in the Rescue Disk, booted up on it, restored my earlier system, exited and rebooted.

Nothing. Before I'd been able to get into safe mode, but now nothing. So when I manually restored my system, guess which program got yanked? And it freed up a lot of system resources, too. (Had I known how much before, that alone would have soured me.) My system now runs faster and doesn't lag while typing.

Another small criticism: Even though Fix-It has automatic update for virus scans, I found more often than not I had to go to the VCom site and manually download the anti-virus files. No reason was ever given; I'd just get a message telling me to do it. Very inconvenient.

Also WARNING*WARNING: This program has strict activation. You can only have it on one computer, so forget putting it on your notebook computer. 

Finally, be careful when cleaning your registry. Look at every entry this suite wants to delete. If you run it on default, it may remove critical registry keys and settings. In fact, I'd use a different registry cleaner or some of the free ones. 

Fix-It has some great features, but not enough to make it worth the system resources and a system sluggish system. (Not to mention the anti-virus problem). Try System Mechanic instead.

I installed this software after getting it free after rebates, and I must say I am not the least bit impressed. It claims to speed up your system, but instead only slows it down. Seems like it would be because it was bugging down my computer, but it's relatively new and has a gig of memory. As another reviewer mentioned, my internet stopped working correctly (although the other computers on my network without this program worked just fine with internet!) and my system restore just wouldn't work. It deleted a lot of entries I needed to run my system correctly.

The anti-spyware was an absolute joke & the updates were large files almost every day. 8 MB a day practically.

On a lighter note, Fix-It Utilities found a virus other programs were unable to find.

I use Zone Alarm Security Suite and then use CCleaner to take care of the rest. I think they're the best combination. No program beats Zone Alarm's. Fast, secure, and won't bug down your computer. I had to reinstall my operating system thanks to Fix-It Utilities

I installed the product hoping it would help me with all the errors I was getting (I have Windows XP). Well, 2 weeks and $200 it's what it took for me to have my computer repaired. It would not let me log on to windows, I got errors I've never seen and it completely messed all my files. BIG waste of money. I had to re-format my hard drive and my computer is only 1 month old!!

Purchased Fix-It Utilities 6 a few weeks back and installed it on my desk top running Windows XP.  Immediately after installation I ran the program and repaired only the minimum errors as recommended.  However, many programs on my computer would not run and could not access many files.  Called VCOM for help ,but  their solution did not work.  I was even unable to get system restore to correct the problem. I had to re-format my hard drive and re-install all my programs and files.  I cannot recommend this registry repair

Don't buy this software even if you get it free after rebates.  It corrupts your windows registry and makes things worse for you.  You will feel your computer is far better after uninstalling this software.

Instead, just follow these steps to keep your PC fast:
1.  Run Disk Cleanup (provided by XP)
2.  Defrag your hard-disk regularly
3.  Clean the registry (there are lot of free software available to clean your registry).  

That's all that you need to keep your computer fit.  No need to use softwares such as Fix-I

I recently purchased an HP Laptop that, to my regret, came with a pre-load of Win Vista.  Some of the bad things about this package are:

1. The help files are all on line.  If I'm not connected to the internet, I can't access the help files.

2. HP does ship it's laptops with the Vista install CD's.  Instead, a CD to purchase an upgrade to the next version of Vista is included.

3. For the newer laptops, HP is not producing drivers for any other OS except Vista.

4. Vista is less user friendly than XP or even 2000.

5. And yes, Vista looks familiarly like OS X, but is harder to work with.  I have owned several Apples and looks are deceiving.  Just because it looks like an Apple doesn't mean it works like one.

6. All of my instructional software no longer works.  I use a lot of software to teach Information Security that no longer works on Vista, such as:
  a. CyberCiege (An information security wargame)
  b. Boson CCNA Network Simulator
  c. Visual Studio (Not everything works)

7. Also, some of the network management tools will not run or run properly on Vista.  I do a lot of remote management from the workstation versus going to the server.  Many of the vendors that provide tools are way behind the power curve on their Vista support.

I could go on but what's the point?  I can't even dump Vista to go back to Windows XP or even 2000 if HP won't even make an attempt to produce drivers for the laptop.  Linux is out for the same reason, no drivers.  So I'm basically stuck with an overpriced emailer and word processor.

If you plan on purchasing a computer, make sure that if you plan on dumping the OS and going back to XP or changing to LINUX, the vendor has all of the drivers to support the change is not on the Microsoft Vista Conspiracy bandwagon

Come one people, Windows Vista is not only as unstable as it's Windows predecesors with a very uglu memory management and a really unsecure and ineffective hard drive and files management; I've lost lots of very important files due to Windows "errors" that shut down applications and even the PC itself, so i decided my self: TO USE LINUX OR TO DIE WITH MICROSOFT !, and i'm still alive ! ;-)

As i told you, Vista is nothing more but a cheap copy of visual effects that Linux users had from several years from now; in facto, right now i'm using a Linux version called Sabayon and it is a million light years away from Windows Vista, it's visual effects are simply incredible (try searching "Beryl" in youtube for you to know what i'm talking aboyt), i have not only 3D windows, but 3D Desktops, incredible effects to minimize and maximize and a veeeery looooong list of features that you have to see it for yourself to beleave it.

I know that you might be concerned for several aspects at this points that wooried me in time (when i was evaluating Windows Vs Linux):
1.- My Documents, that will happen with them?. Nothing will happen, in fact you'll ba able to open them and modify them as you please, the OppenOffice suite is totally compatibble with your Microsoft Documents.
2.- My programs?, well there are several options to run Windows programs in Linux, as "cedega", "wine", etc etc etc, si it means that you will be able to run most of the windows programs in Linux.
3.- Is it hard to use ?. No way !, it's as easy to use as Windows, you will only have to dedicate a few time (may be a couple of hours) to understand several conceps as the multiple destops, the file system, and the users and permission management (that is the one of the most secures in the world) (Microsoft Windows cant's say that!).

So, if you don't beleave search google for sabayon and youtube for beryl and you will open your eyes!.

So... think about spending this 400 bucks twice, because Sabayon and other versions as Ubuntu, Kubuntu, some versions of SUSE, and other Linux distributions are TOTALY FREE of charge!. you only have to download them and burn it to a CD or DVD, whatever you like.

I bought Vista to get the inevitable familiarity over with as early as possible and what I discovered was an operating system not even close to being compatible yet. Half if not 80% of all routers are not Vista-ready yet, so you can't get a network running for at least a few more months. Any accesories you own with your system no longer work unless they're compatible.. (ie, printers, scanners, burners, etc) so you not only buy an operating system, you have to buy an entirely new set of hardware to go with it. Majority of my programs did not work with Vista, be it Adobe software, Maya, Poser and God forbid any games you own like Warcraft. For the expense and complete hassel, it's not worth owning until eveything is "Ready" (which will probably be a year from now) Save your money. - I returned my copy

This OS is not for any ordinary user.  If you know nothing about drivers, peripherals, etc, then don't get this OS.  Lots of incompatability issues.  I thought this OS would make my gaming experience better, apparently it needs lots of work.  Can't play CS:S, Day of Defeat, Lord of the rings Online, etc.  BF2142 and some other games play slower in Vista compared to XP.  I hardly write reviews, but I just want everyone to know that this OS suxs!  Stay with XP Pro SP2.  Games move faster and load better and encoding video and editing software runs much much better on XP.  It isn't worth getting right now, wait a year or two until it gets worked out.  Feels like BETA, which it shouldn't.  Microsoft, you get a F- for your new OS.  You fail.  Nice try

I'm not a tech guy.  But from a simple user's standpoint, there is no reason whatsoever to change unless you just have to have a small change in appearance.  About 1/2 the software you might have purchased that worked with XP won't work with Vista.  

I was thinking that Vista would be an improvement.  But there is nothing there.  Just some minor superficial changes as far as I can tell.  Maybe for IT people, there might be some big difference, but for your average user, there is no improvement at all.

Save your money.  Don't buy it.

You will probably be more productive and less bug ridden if you stick with what you have.
15 years of Outlook and you can't print a single address label or an envelope with one click. (or 10 clicks for that matter)
There is no function to easily print out mailing labels either. 
Lets remember Outlook is a Contact manager ... next to many other things... 

Maybe Outlook 2010 will be the answer.

For those considering Outlook 2007, beware of my experience: one morning I ran Outlook 2007 to find it would not download email messages at all. (I would get an error about MAPI.) This appears to be due to an automatic office update of the junk mail filter.

One of the most important features of an email program is that it doesn't suddenly stop being able to check email (imagine being on a business trip). Automatic improvements to the junk mail filter sounds great, but if that means one morning I wake up to not be able to check email at all, then the medicine is worse than the disease.

The new features and changes Outlook 2007 really do not compensate for the lack of reliability. If you have another email program that works, I'd stick with it and not switch to Outlook 2007.

On a positive note, I was able to fix the above problem by running repair (reinstall) from the Office 2007 install program, but this took half an hour or so to run.

I have 7 and 9 year old boys that play chess.  They are also both very computer savy.  I bought this program to buff up their chess playing skills and stategy, but they say they find it boring and don't think it has anything to do with playing chess because the game pieces and boards look nothing like the traditional game pieces.  The characters are very difficult to identify and confusing, they are cartoon renditions dressed up in costumes.  I'd save your money and look for a better chess program or get your child involved in an actual chess club

Im going to rate this product a 2 because I like it but I would change a few things if I could.  It does show you a lot of chords and how to play properly and all that good stuff.  The couple of things I would change is the fact that when they are teaching you a chord, you can play along with the program but its only about 15 seconds, then  you have to stop and click play again.  I wish there was an option where  you could choose to repeat it on its own a few times so you dont have to stop every time to play it again.  The other thing is something a little more important.  The product has a program where you could go online to down load a lot of songs to play, its called OLGA.  Well this website is having legal problems and is not online anymore.  So you dont have that option of learning to play your favorite songs from the Beetles or Metalica or The Grateful Dead or anyone else, and thats what they advertise "Play hit songs". So overall, knowing all this I would have shopped around more.  Especially for the price, its defenitly not worth 40-50 dollars when all you get is little 15 second examples on jingle bells and little traditional folk songs.

I bought this CD title b/c I wanted to learn how to play the guitar again.  My decision to purchase this was based solely on all the Amazon reviews that I perused beforehand.  You can definitely learn to play the guitar with this, but there are so many other titles out there that are cheaper and more up-to-date.  Furthermore, there is nothing more annoying to me than hearing the instructor loudly singing the songs over the guitar strumming.  His voice dominants in many parts of the lessons, and it deafens the sound of the guitar which makes it very difficult to hear the chords being taught.  Again, the software is good but may not be the best on the market.  Then again, I've only purchased three titles, and this one offers a few things that the others don't include

The problem with this game starts with the introductury movie... it develops slowly, goes on forever, suffers from disconnected animation and does little to set up the ridiculous premise for game play. 

Once game play FINALLY does start, my child found the games boring and the TRANSITIONS between the games tediously slow.  Cute characters...zero edutainment.  It was consigned to the dustbin by the end of the day

I guess I'm spoiled by the I Spy games I've purchased for my children. This game has an enormous amount of "story"...it's almost as bad as sitting your child in front of the television. Interaction is confusing and frustrating. I'd rate this lower but it's clear that a lot of work went into the animation, which is top notch. I just wouldn't classify this as a learning game.

I have a 2 month old high-end Dell PC with tons of memory and disk, running Windows XP Pro.  This game doesn't work.  Period.  First of all, when I installed it, it reset my graphics options.  Second, when I attempt to play a game, even at the settings that it chose, I get nothing but a white screen.  After numerous tries, and killing the program with the task manager, I finally attempted the other Activities options.  Clicking on them does absolutely nothing!  It doesn't recognize my mouse clicks.

I'm assuming that the game was written for the Apple Mac, and ported to the PC.  Trust me, it doesn't work.  

BTW, we have tons of other kids games and have never had a problem with any of them.  

Now I have to figure out how to return this silly thing.

This thing is a nightmare. First, it is impossible to understand unless you already know how to run some other comparable system. Next, it requires a huge amount of fiddling with buffers (believe me -- read the help files on this, which are huge and suggest ten different things to do when your music doesn't sound good, and trust me, it won't, either before or after unlimited tweaking). Finally, it actually does not export as it says it does. It lost my files, including one song I cannot quite reproduce (gone forever). Bottom line: If your idea of fun is spending two weeks of vacation fiddling with software that does not work and will never work, then by all means, buy this garbage. I have been using computers since 1985, and this is, I think, the worst single product I've ever seen. On the other hand, if you want to actually make music, you might want to try Sony's ACID Pro 6, which you can try out for free (the company thinks you'll like it, whereas the sadists at Cakewalk must know perfectly well that you won't, hence no demo).

Cakewalk"s advertisement saying something like..." no experience needed to operate this software..." is, in my mind, mis-leading at least and a down right lie at most. I've had it now for about three weeks, work on it most days, usually in the middle of the night so I can really concentrate on it, and still cant get anything out of it.
All I wanted was some backing tracks for my acoustic guitar work...blues, pop, country....so far nothing and I am thinking about giving up.
I can operate a computer but this skill has nothing to do with this most confusing piece of junk I have ever seen.
BEWARE...unless your a recording engineer you probably will be disapointed.

This is the slowest. Operating. System I have ever used. The first time I installed XP Home, I didn't see what was so bad about it, but when we tried installing it on our new Gateway Machine, it imedettly slowed all system operations down to a crawl. Even My brother's laptop, which is a very Fast Machine, has XP pro, and it randomly slows down. Don't get this operating system. It's slow, buggy, and expensive

This operating system was one of the most unsatisfactory I have ever used--including DOS, Win 3.1, Windows 95 and Windows 98. 

Aside from being incompatible with older hardware, XP Home Edition crashes frequently-particularly if you like to work with several windows open at once. 

Most important, the program is highly susceptible to viruses and hackers. Preventing these two problems requires expensive add-on software and hardware. 

True enough, the built-in firewall OUGHT to work. But in my case, hackers got in anyway. I had to hire an expensive data recovery guru-another story in itself. 

Even reinstalling the program did not solve the problem. My computer was completely compromised. I was eventually forced to junk the machine. 

After my dreadful experience with XP Home Edition, I have sworn off Windows forever. Mac and Linux are both far superior

Do not buy this.  Go with Mac OS X 4.2 Tiger, it doesn't crash or lock up.  Plus you will get access to really cool applications out of the box that lets you do almost anything media-wise.  I could go one for hours how the Macintosh operating system is better but I will say one last thing...  Tiger is faster than Windows.  Research has proved that Tiger and all the other operating systems conserve CPU performance to such an extent that 90%-100% of the speed is left for applications and such.  Windows eats up so much speed along with DOS that from 20%-30% of the performance is left for the user.  That puts a normal Windows computer (3Ghz) at less than 1Ghz.  While a normal Mac computer (2Ghz) runs at 2Ghz.  Plus the fastest Mac is a dual G5 each running at 2.7Ghz.  So actual speed is 5.4Ghz.  The fastest Windows computer is around 3.6Ghz which runs around 1Ghz.  That is a HUGE difference (5.4Ghz-1Ghz.)  When Apple moves to Intel chips next year (about,) The Macs will run around 6.4Ghz if not more.  That is an even MORE HUGE difference.  Take my word for it.  The Windows world is not worth it.  Whenever I go on my Mom's computer (which is running on Windows XP,) I encounter a lock up or annoying hickup in the OS, EVERY TIME!!  I agree that a good amount of people don't find Windows to be unstable, but even when I go to a friend's house I notice them there as well.  Every Windows computer I have used for more than 20 minutes has locked up.  But it's not just this, it's also that Tiger is so much easier to use.

Take my advice (I've converted many people) and switch to Mac... Please.  I swear that most of you who read this and switch will be very pleased.  It might be a little wierd at first to get used to the new OS, but I mastered it in a day when it took me months on Windows.  Plus you can purchase Microsoft Word for Mac as well (which I think is easier to use than the Window's counterpart.)

So go and throw that ugly Windows computer away and get a spanking new, shiny white, STABLE, Mac!!!

I have used DOS, Win3.1, Win95, Win98 and now this piece of crap OS. Microsoft's only interest is making money, thats why they come out with a new release of an OS upon a new release of an OS. Each one just as buggy, insecure and unstable as the previous version.
Anything coming from Microsoft just plain sucks.
I have now switched from InterCrap explorer to Mozilla and from Out-Crash-express to Thunderbird, soon I will completely switch to Linux, a FAR better and FUNCTIONAL OS for a far better price, namely free. My next laptop will be a Mac.
Dont waste your money, Microsoft designed software is garbage by definition. And for the person saying he can understand we are not all geeks : I shouldnt HAVE to be a frigging geek to use an O

Since buying the upgrade of windows XP i have had to reinstall
it 3 times -onto a clean hard disk- The first time it just disappeared and turned into a blue screen,with messages that hive files were gone missing? 2nd time round the registery got
corrupted and the last time it refused to boot,and not wanting
to have to trall through another install i used the XP CD to try the recovery consol. This was as much use as a cigarette
lighter on a motor bike. None of the commands worked,and even trying the help file was useless. There seems to be a serious
problem with system restore in XP, and im fully updated with all the latest SPacks,and stacks of space on my hard disk  alotted to SR! Check dates will disappear and when you really need ST to get you back and running -it goes pear shaped! I now running 3 restored version of XP completly backed up on a seperate hard disk using Power Quests Drive image.
My experences with XP are ITS NOT RELIABLE..

I'm going to have to the Mac store genius bar to get the problems straightened out.  All in all I think that every thing will work OK but I'm going to have yto travel over 50 miles to get it fixed.  Maybe it's best to stick with Mac software for Macs.  I've NEVER has a problem installing them

This product arrived with 2 number 2 installation disks for the Virtual PC and no number 1.  As a result, I was not able to install VPC, which was one of the reasons I purchased this overly expensive product.  The Office part does not seem that signicant an upgrade to the Office X that I had. So it is both an aggravation and a rip off

I purchased the upgrade since I'd already bought both Office v.X and Virtual PC 6.1 last year. 

The biggest letdown is that Microsoft's promised support for the G5 is nearly non-existent.  I have a dual processor G5 with an ATI Radeon 9800 card (Apple), and after trying to install Virtual PC 7 three times, I cannot get a VM to work.  It did install (and work) flawlessly on my G4 Powerbook.  Googling for reviews finds it's very hit or miss, but if (when) it misses, you'll regret investing the extra $$$ in an immature product

This product will not work on my notebook even after multiple installs. The tech support emailed that any CD or DVD copy software had to be removed. I guess that sort of makes a DVD or CD R/W drive rather pointless. I removed the copy software and still have bad results. About 1 out of twenty times it get to the menu were you can actually use it.  Maybe it doesn't like my corporate virus protection. I find it hard to believe that a lot of government agencies and large companies use this software if it that picky. I rate this product as totally useless.

I have had trouble and no satisfaction with this product.

I am downloading Grateful Dead concerts from the internet. I want to turn them into audio or data CDs. Sometimes I get a whole concert as one giant file; I want to cut that into tracks and save it. Sometimes I get a bunch of tracks; I want to combine the songs that "go into" one another (my car stereo inserts a two-second delay between tracks). One of the things I want to do is to save the files (which are mostly MP3s) in the same bit rate and format as the originals, so I loose as little "music" as possible.

The MP3 codec seems to be really buggy. Most of the combinations of bit rates and codec strategies create really wacky files: some go 5/6 normal speed, others are compressed into chopped up shortened versions of the original. When I pick a combination of settings that work, I usually lose a lot of fidelity as compared to the original (even when I'm only combinining four MP3's into one).

Try cutting one MP3 into two, and then recombining the parts into a whole. No matter what I try, there's a little click in the place where the two files are joined. This should be an easy thing, since a lot of very basic editing is cutting and splicing.

The upshot is, buying this was $40 down the drain. I'm going to have to find better software for my purposes

The reviews of this software are a bit harsh, but pretty much true. It slow, is a resource hog, doesn't really like to share the machine with other applications. Support is bad, email transfer to move it to another system just plain doesn't work and it is really hard to make a complete backup with all of your attachments.  And - Windows Vista support is really limited.

That said, if you have a really fast machine it does work well and has features I use every day that I can't get anywhere else. You can save any email as a history record attached to the sender OR any other person in your contact database. These attachments are copies so they stay with the database even if you purge your email (which is nice). 

Email client is simple, but because it ISN'T OUTLOOK - I have personally been almost completely unaffected by worms, virus and other email hazards that have over the years affected most MS Outlook users. This is a feature that has saved me more time than the hassles in the first paragraph.

The program runs smoothly for me but, I have a Core 2 Duo 7200 with 2 gigabytes of RAM. Just about the fastest processor you can get. I think without the maximum processor and memory you WILL have delays and slooow loading times.

One more issue you might have is making backups. Since it uses a SQL database that is open whenever SQL Server is running, a normal backup program might not be able to backup the database file. You need to stop the service first. This is a hassle that if you don't know about you might be setting yourself up for disaster.

Let's start with Outlook interface.  These are the exact words from their user manual:

"ACT! 2007 E-mail will work through Microsoft Outlook versions 2000, 2002 (XP) or 2003."

So those of us with newer versions of Outlook cannot synch the Outlook email or calendar with Act.  What's the point?  Then what are you supposed to synch with your Blackberry - Outlook so you can get your calendar and email information or Act so you can get your client database.
The Act email is so basic and primitive looking, you  can't put attractive auto signatures on it.

Then they tell you that you can have one month of telephone support, but it's only available during work days, not on the weekends.  Since I purchased the product on the weekend, I won't be able to speak with someone to ask for a full refund until Monday.  I've used this product for 24 hours and I'm giving up.  What a waste of time and money.

How does this company survive with such a bad product?  

If anyone knows of a good CRM program for a small business, please share.

iF i COULD, i WOULD GIVE THIS NEGATIVE STARS.Caveat emptor! Let the buyer beware. I made the horrible and expensive mistake of buying this the beginning of Feb. 2007. I had to open the box to realize I needed to load it as administrator. That was beyond my limited knowledge. Since it was opened I stupidly believed in their money back guarantee and got a return authorization. It took forever and many calls. They kept on lying on when the refund was mailed. Yes, this went into April 2007!!!!! They insisted the mailing date was April 9th. On the 18th I thought I'd never get it. They stopped payment and maybe issued another. Well, I received the $199 (I am shafted on my state sales tax.) But because those idiots didn't put the name of my street, it apprently was returned and what I got was postmarked April 16th!!!!! And they refuse to rescind the stoppayment. Sooooo...I now need to pray I will ever receive the replacement. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I can't beleive these people sell accounting and contact software

Good grief.  Where do I begin?  We upgraded two computers from 6.0 to ACT 2007.  Prior to the install, we totally reformatted our hardrives and did a clean install of Windows XP.  We performed an XP update, installed MS Office and basically had two smokin' clean machines - more or less brand new.  Then we we installed ACT! 2007 expecting perfection. Our problems with the software have been:

1) Miserable, buggy installation - barely worked.

2) Inability to convert our old ACT 6.0 e-mail database into the new version of ACT 2007. 
 
3) Slow, slow, sloooowwww performance.

4) e-mails will delete themselves for no apparant reason.  This is the worst of all.

5) Terrible syncing with the Palm.  Sometimes it works, other times it doesn't, overwrites data when it is not supposed to and vice-versa.

5) Useless Sage tech support.

Don't buy this product.  In fact, I would never buy another product from Sage ever again.  My colleague has already ditched ACT! and switched to using the Palm Desktop and Outlook Express.  This was after losing all his e-mails.  If I lose all my e-mails again - I will uninstall and ditch my copy altogether.

I would love to reclaim the hours of my life lost to this poorly written loser of a program.

1 Star is being generous.  I've been an ACT user for almost 20 years.  I think it's time to say good-bye.

Reasons:

1.  2007 version is agonizingly slow.  Effects my whole system.  I added 1 gb of RAM bringing my total to 2gb with no improvement.  Seems like 5 secs to execute ANY command in the program.  Doesn't seem like much bu count it...one one thousand, two one thousand...  It adds up when you use the program all day, every day.

2.  Support is atrocious. You get 60 days after purchase and then can't even access their tech moderated forum unless you pay $300 a year.

3.  It ought to be broken down.  I use it to manage client information and communication, I don't need all the Opportunity garbage and one can spend more time managing a process than actually doing the darn thing.

4.  Support sticks.  In the last couple of years, I've never had a phone call answered in less than 30 minutes...and that includes when I was dumb enough to pay the then $200 a year.

5.  Support stinks even when you pay 300 a year.

6.  Support is a ripoff.  One support plan.  No by incident option.  300 bucks or nothing.

7.  Did I mention that support is the worst?  They seem to do things on the website and then think about what they just did.  Navigating their forums is a nightmare.  I had to click around for 10 minutes this morning to figure out how to post in an unmoderated forum.  (BTW, 4 messages total in the 2007 section in 6 months.  I guess most pay their 300 bucks for the moderated forum.)

8.  An example of how time consuming it can be:  It took me a week of phone calls with several reps to get the UPGRADE installation to function.  And I mean it didn't function at all.  It made such a mess that I had to reformat my hard drive to get it to install.  A first in 20+ years of computer use.

Sage seems to think this program is the only one a user installs on their computer.  Bad attitude.

SAGE and ACT! are poster children of everything bad about the software industry today.

Do yourself a favor, if older versions are working for you...stay there.  The enhancements in 2007 are not worth the trouble.

If you're looking for a contact manager, look elsewhere.

It is difficult to use words harsh enough to describe this product and this company.
I have owned this software for about 80 days. 
1. In 80 days of use this product has completely locked up or not opened twice.
2. I have called the 'support' line 4 times. The minimum time I was on hold was 40 minutes.
3. My initial 'support' period is about to expire and I now will have to pay $200 to get more 'support'
4. You have to buy additional software to get your data onto a palm device.

In summary: The product has locked up about every 40 days and the average hold time is 40 minutes when you call them.

Save yourself the grief - buy nothing or buy something else

I have been a long-time ACT! user. My biggest complaint is recovery. If you have to move the email and database to another computer due to a failure you have to jump through hoops; that's just what one feels like doing when the pressure is on. I still can't bring my ACT! 2007 email over even though ACT! says it was restored successfully (empty folders!). They have a ridiculous technical support team unwilling to help unless you pay, pay and pay and their knowledge base must have been restored like my email: non-existent. The earlier versions were great. I agree with a previous reviewer that when they switched to SQL it all went downhill. I think I'll stick with anything else. It is really ashame. ACT! used to be fast, tight and clean; now it is clunky, lethargic and hangs for 20 seconds on all the time (for some stupid reason) running on an a 2.4 dual core AMD with 4GB memory. Even when Symantec had it they didn't screw it up, but now, you may be better-off sticking with the Palm Pilot contact management software--well, maybe not

I just purchased the top end Dell Dimension XPS (with the 10,000 RPM harddrive) but I still have to allow about 10 seconds for the initial program startup, then it seems to hang for 15 to 20 seconds after that. I usually just go get a cup of coffee when I start ACT and when I come back we are ready to roll.

I also reboot my system every time I close ACT.  The system just seems to run better without any "lingering" remnants of the program in memory.

Whenever I delete a contact the program locks up.  It has done this through several versions.  I simply reboot, restart ACT and it works fine.

At some point ACT changed the date on many (hundreds) of my activities to 11/18/2004.  Now I manually type the date into the call, to do, meeting and note fields to avoid this problem in the future.

I have been an ACT customer since the early DOS days.  I have a huge commitment to the program in that much of my important data is now stored here (and some of it is nowhere else).  It is so difficult to export "all the data" (including notes, history, etc) that I am basically trapped.

My point is, a program like this is not one that you can easily bail out of like Word or Excel, which has some alternatives available which will read your current files.  A lot of the ACT! database is proprietary and while you can purchase a conversion program from a few vendors, it is not a cheap proposition to do so

We may never know if we like this product as the Amazon box was empty when it arrived.  We have had no help from amazon, compusa, nor the maker of this software after numerous emails and phone calls.  This was my son's Christmas present and he's still waiting... at this rate we'll end up with the opinion that we shouldn't order software online...

DarkBASIC is only good for people very new to programming and interested in games. To make a commercial-quality game in this language would be lunacy, BASIC just isn't quite flexible enough to do that with ease, and the DarkBASIC renderer looks very, very ugly. However, BASIC remains very easy to learn and DarkBASIC has some commands that are fun to toy with.

If you're trying to get into serious game development, learn C++ and either learn how to use libraries like OpenGL or DirectX, or start modding a popular engine like the Unreal engine or Source. And make sure you've learned a good deal of physics and math

I got this as a present about two years ago, and I have had mixed feelings.  I like it, but I get really frustrated because the program is buggy.  I cannot create a standalone executable, and the program has random bugs.  Also, it is very hard to create proffesional-type games.  Be aware that the machine you run standalone programs on has to have a video card, regardless of whether you use it or not.  In conclusion, good idea, but very buggy

I bought a new state-of-the-art computer in February that came preloaded with Windows Vista. I was initially excited to get a computer that was running the newest operating system, and I hoped it would mean that my computer would have a much longer effective life. I have been nothing but disappointed since receiving this machine, especially knowing that had I called Dell, they would have installed XP instead.

PROs:
-Better security (it prompts me & allows me to stop some of the annoying "automatic" programs that software makers sneak onto your system)
-Better appearance (this is strictly cosmetic, and I'd rather stare at an ugly screen that worked rather than a pretty, useless one)

CONs:
-FREEZING: I use this computer 2-3 hours a day and I can expect 1-2 freezes/day. Restarting often fails, and I have to cut the power and restart again.
-DISPLAY PROBLEMS: although the cosmetics of the program were better, Vista can't display anything right. I tried updating the display driver which caused a major crash after restarting. I had to boot in safe mode and rollback the driver to get my computer back. Apparently, the newest display drivers are incompatible with Vista.
-INCOMPATIBILITY: Entirely too many programs are incompatible with Vista, including some fairly big ones (lots of Adobe software, iPods, display drivers, etc.) I know Vista is new, and these software companies are slow to adapt, but does it really make sense for an operating system like Vista to render virtually all of my other software obsolete? Why can't Vista play nicely with the other kids?
-ITS SLOW!!!-- Part of the reason I bought a new, state-of-the-art computer was to replace my old laptop (which still runs OK, but has become a little buggy & sluggish in the past 4 years). Although this computer is light years ahead of the old one, it actually runs EVEN SLOWER than my old laptop. Technical support has largely attributed this to the demands of Vista.

BOTTOM LINE:
1. IF YOU ARE NOT GOOD WITH COMPUTERS, AVOID VISTA LIKE THE PLAGUE
2. VISTA IS A RIP-OFF. Save your money and keep/get XP-- I'm probably going to return my computer and make the manufacturer install XP so I can regain some speed and system stability. Maybe in the future Vista will work OK, but not right now...
3. The incompatibility issues-- though there are several-- conspicuously include problems with Mac-oriented software (iPod, Adobe). I can't help but feel that Microsoft built-in these specific incompatibility issues in order to battle Apple

 Microsoft should have done more testing on this product.  This is one mess up product.  I have never seen a version of Microsoft Windows so mess up.  There are so many bugs in this product it is not funny.  I've always been a big Microsoft fan, but I can't endorse this version of Microsoft Windows.  I'm a PC and Console gamer and let me tell you something.  Microsoft Windows Vista does not go with most PC games.  That is very sad.

 Even if Microsoft gave me a free version of Microsoft Windows Vista Home Premium, I wouldn't take it.  I've read where some Federal Government Agencies won't even use Microsoft Windows Vista because it so mess up and it has so many bugs in it.  I'll stick with Microsoft Windows XP which from what I understand pretty much does all the same things that Microsoft Windows Vista does but without all the bugs in it. Plus you can play any PC game on Microsoft Windows XP.  You can't do that with Microsoft Windows Vista.  I love Microsoft Windows XP.

 Why should anyone waste their time and money upgrading to Microsoft Windows Vista if it doesn't work right?  It is really frustrating because brand new PC games coming out right now and in the future aren't compatible with Microsoft Windows Vista.  If you don't believe me, go into different gaming web sites and read about all the problems people are having playing brand new PC games that just came out with Microsoft Window Vista.  Please Microsoft, fix Microsoft Windows Vista

I think this product is highly overated and this claim
of being 99% accurate is false.
Once in while it can amaze you by typing a sentence with 100% accuracy , but this enthusiasm is quickly dashed when
you realise that the very next sentence is complete
gibberish which bears absolutely no relation to what you
said and you wonder how it could have possibly interpeted
what you have in that manner.
I think this program maybe accent sensitive so that a person with an American accent may get good results while 
a person with a British or an Australian accent may get poor results for the same level of training.
In summary I think the program is unreliable with an
accuracy of 45% at its present level of developement.
It has plenty of potential and with future developement
 it could much more reliable but at its present level of
developement I think the performance is mediocre.

I will never buy another product from this manufacturer. I have a legal copy of this program, and on the weekend my motherboard died. I had to buy a new board then reinstall all my software, and when I got to DNS8 it told me I'd registered too many times and I had to buy a new copy.
Hidden somewhere in the site I found reference to uninstalling the previous install whilst online to allow me to install it again. So, I dug out my old hard drive, set it up temporarily, connected to the internet and uninstalled. Went to the new machine and installed and ... no dice. Same message.
This is the worst example of product activation, and when I went to customer support they wanted my credit card number in order to charge ME $9.95 to install a legally purchased product. I will now explore other means because I fully intend to use the software I paid a lot of money for.
And in case anyone from the company ever reads this (unlikely), I'm going to use all my online clout to tell people just how annoyed I am. I only get one thousand three hundred unique visitors per day to my websites and blogs, but that adds up to quite a few people over a couple of months and you can be damn sure every one of them will hear about this. I once wrote a lengthy blog post praising your product. Now it's time for the addendum

G'day, 

I bought DNS 8 Standard to use mainly on trips so I could keep a diary of the trips.

When I tried it, the voice recognition was so-so.  

The worst part was that after about 3 pages the "file" fills up and you have to begin a new one.

Now maybe there is a way around this, but I and no one else will be able to find out from Nuance.  Their customer [dis]service is down at the bottom of the Marianas Trench.  [I could make reference to whale droppings, but that wouldn't be polite.]

I emailed them about this and was told to call for an answer.  However, that would be my one and only free call.

I really think, Nuance needs competition.

Hello there Microsoft

I bought this software because I really wanted to learn Spanish and be fluent. The price and marketing of the company made me believe that this package was the most complete package on the market.
So I was very excited to receive it after spending $450 on a software. My excitement did not last long after that.
I was shocked to see how the software itself looked, I was expecting a top of the line interface for the price I paid but that software seemed years old.
But I still wanted to get my money worth so tried the first level for hours, even days, as I was convinced I could learn Spanish with it. I also tried the other 2 levels to make sure that my issue was not only with that first level.
I had looked at the demo and noticed that most of the content was based on that same acitivity with the 4 pictures. I was expecting different exercises for the full version...The software gets so repetitive, I was really disappointed, even more because of the outrageous price of that package

This was a huge waste of money. If you have plans to make a custom animation, do not buy this.  Anime only alows you to manipulate one of their few charecters.  You can not change eye color or hair color.  If you want a good animation you have to go to one of their websites and purchase a character for $10- $20.  Their free ones are completly dumb. Using their "easy to use" bone rigging tool takes a long time to set up and use.  It took me ten minutes to make one for a stick figure. (which didn't work very well) You can't even group anything unless you buy their $180 upgraded version.  I  spent hours trying to use this, and could figure none of the above out.  It also took two weeks to get here instead of four days.  I don't recomend this to people who are looking for an easy to use animation creator.

Don't buy Vista--any version, yet.  MS released it WAY too early.  Some examples why:  

* Too many hardware drivers not yet available, i.e., Creative Audigy  sound cards; Nvidia graphics cards, and Linksys wireless network components, just to mention a few.  When I contacted product manufacturers, I sensed a ho-hum attitude.  Moreover, some peripherals are totally incompatible.  Example:  My Epson Perfection 1650 scanner was rejected by Vista, so I was forced to buy a newer model (Epson Perfection 4990 Photo).  Hmmmm.  One wonders whether these sorts of incompatibilities result more by design (purposely?) than from insurmountable technological deficiencies.

*  Too many Vista compatible application updates are not yet available. 

*  The "Upgrade" versions of MS Vista (versus the "full" versions) seem to be full of bugs.  Soon after I installed Vista Ultimate, I encountered a major problem that MS tech support has been trying to resolve for over two weeks.  It is so pervasive that MS Outlook 2007 has been affected to the extent that some of its features are not available.  It appears that during the installation process, something went awry with "Windows Event Log" and the "Event Viewer."  Furthermore, the latest version (Vista compatible) of Diskeeper 2007 Pro will not launch, most likely for the same reason. 

*  It appears MS went way overboard on security features to the extent of paranoia.  Every time you click on just about anything, a pop-up will appear asking your permission to "allow" it to launch.  Very annoying, and VERY unnecessary.  It's as though MS adopted an underlying assumption throughout the development process that the average end user has an IQ of about 85. 

*  MS tech support quality has deteriorated substantially.  Most of the time when you call you will reach someone in India.  Albeit these people are very polite, they cannot think "outside the box."  Nor are they in touch sufficiently enough with the nuances of the English language, thus impairing expeditious understanding on both sides of the conversation.  Based upon my recent experience with these folks, I sense that a soccer mom could be trained as a MS tech support rep in very little time. What I mean by that is this:  During my multiple contacts with them I developed the feeling they rely totally on reading from manuals, scripts, and on-line knowledge bases.  In other words, they seem not to be able to analyze and troubleshoot problems independent of external references.  

* Bottom line:  Do NOT purchase Vista until AFTER service pack 1 is released, or whatever they happen to name their first major fix-it update package.  For now, stay with the more reliable XP versions.  I truly regret that I had to discover all of this the hard way.  It has been very costly in more ways than one.

I have used Turbo Tax for as long as I can remember.  I have always purchased their business and their personal tax products.  Generally I had been satisfied. However this year after spending much time over many months working on a complicated return, Turbo tax dumped all the data including that which was saved many times over several months. It corrupted all but 2kb of data and can't even open that. Of course you can't get a person via telephone or email.  

I would give them o stars if that was an option. So long Intuit

This was my first year using Turbotax, and it's also my last!

Since 1992 I was a faithful user of HR Block's Taxcut for Mac.  In spite of it costing more than the Windows version, I used it every year except for 1995 when various problems related to my AOL dial-up service prevented me from using it.  Since TurboTax is the only option out there for people who use a Mac, you'd think I'd be continuing to use them for now on, - but you'd be wrong!

I purchased my copy of TurboTax Deluxe from Amazon.com to save $5.  Since TaxCut made certain that no information from it's software could ever be imported by other software, I filled in my personal data as I began.  I was a little disappointed that TurboTax doesn't allow you to skip the "step-by-step" method, and just fill in the actual forms the way TaxCut did as an option.    While the downloads were an annoyance (6 or 7 separate files each time), for the most part the software was OK.  Picking up from where you leave off wasn't always possible, but 5 or 6 clicks would get you back to the right spot.

My first major annoyance came with the state software.  After filling in some data, and seeing the overall results, I wanted to look at the forms to see what they were doing with my data.  I also needed to see where they had placed data that was imported from the federal information I'd entered.  Well, there's no way to see your data on state forms until you're finished and print them out (or preview as .pdf files from the print dialogue).  When you do that the software somehow magically creates the state forms for printing, but the state forms don't seem to exist anywhere else except in that print spool!  I found this extremely annoying, and a real time waster.

The final blow, however, was when I got to filing.  The advertising is an unnecessary annoyance.  Since I don't owe any state taxes, I just usually print those forms out and mail them in --- it doesn't make any sense to me to pay for filing something when I don't owe anything and I'm not going to benefit from that "faster" refund.  Then I came to the crusher.  TurboTax wanted $30 for e-filing my Federal forms!!  TaxCut charged $14.95 and $15.95, but then they always rebated the cost.  I was told that Intuit used to do that, but obviously they decided to make some additional money this year.  Earlier in the day that I filed the saw the head of the IRS on CNBC being interviewed. He said that e-filing makes their job so much simpler.  Well, if it helps them that much, they should devise a way for computer users who buy software to file returns directly to the IRS without Intuit, H R Block and the others as middlemen.  And they should let us file for free if it makes their work so much easier.

While I have had my doubts about the services that allow you to fill out online forms, and then do your filing for you, I haven't heard of any security problems with them, so that's the direction I'm planning to take next year.  As far as I'm concerned, TurboTax blew it by being unfair with their e-filing fees

I have used Intuit products since 1992, and was quite satisfied until 4 years ago when Intuit began installing hidden software on users' computers in an attempt to "stop piracy", which caused numerous problems for us honest users who paid for the program.
 Secondly and even more significantly, I began noticing an apparent shift in Intuit's philosophy toward it's customers: cut back on customer support, and attempt to exploit them at every possible opportunity in order to make more money.
In short, Intuit disrespects their customers.
As a loyal paying customer, I will not be disrespected or taken for granted. Their level of service and support has declined. Their products constantly pimp you to spend more money on Intuit as you try to use their programs.
That is why I have sworn off Intuit products when there is an alternative.  Why reward someone who treats you badly?

if you have used the online version in the past, stick with it. buying it on disk does not allow you to import data from previous returns if done on line and you can not upload to myturbotax. almost as if two separate companies! plus the User interface on this software stinks bigtime. very hard to navigate back and forth. online version is actually better (though i didn't try it this year). does intuit actually employ programmers or watch real users? they spend far too much money on useless features like videos and not enough on simple ui issues

I have been using Turbo Tax since 1998, I use computers every day, and (as an engineer) I am used to using difficult applications (Pro-E, Mathcad, UG, etc). This years edition of Turbo Tax Deluxe was the worst Turbo tax I have ever seen (& I usually like it very much). I purchased in January and had to update 4 times. One update took 6 hours (some of us live in the boonies and broadband is not an option). In addition, the application brought up menus and selections that were not applicable (farm income at the PA State form). When I tried to delete the entries (at the Federal level as instructed) they would not. My 1 business expense entry kept getting duplicated ("copy 2" and every time I deleted it, it would reappear on the next pass through. Every time I entered the "State" tab, it acted like I was never there before with a "Start State" button that always lead me through all the same questions (It did retain my answers from prior visits). Where was the "Continue State" button? I also noticed that using the "back" button and then moving foreward again caused never before seen dialogs to occur, even though the same "foreward" choices were made. Once I backed up to check something & then moving foreward caused my state tax status to jump from +$46 to -$1548!! Upon backing up I saw that some of the check boxes regarding the sale of my home were unchecked. I did not check them, but rather backed up two more screens, then moved foreward again the two screens and the boxes were again checked! One more foreward click and my taxes again returned to +$46. One of the years I liked best was when there was a "checklist" so you could see where you had been and what was already addressed. This years State was definetly worse than the Federal, but even that was a dissapointment. I did complete this years filings & submitted both online, I hope I don't get burned! Turbo Tax!-- Please improve for next year or it may be my last year. You realize that at 59.95 + 39.95 filing + my time + aggravation like this year, and an accountant is looking attractive. If you are on the "inside" you probably know why this is happening...outsourcing code gen to India, not  outsourcing code gen to India, programmer cut-backs, programming application changes, archiving application changes, project management issues, whatever. Just realize that there is a problem & fix it

Since Tax Cut decided not to produce a Mac version this year, I got stuck with Turbo Tax.  Their website promises that one may import data from the previous year's Tax Cut return.  Then you buy the thing, and you find out that it requires you to load the Turbo Tax program and your 2004 Tax Cut data onto a Windows machine, transfer there, then load it back onto the Mac for this to work.  So, like a chump I borrowed a friend's windows machine and did all this.  But, it doesn't work.  Not at all.  And it takes a lot of time to find that out.  Tried every workaround I could think of.  Nope.  It doesn't work.

For federal returns this is a generally usable product with a very poor User Interface and Help system,   For state returns this product falls below the bar of "usable".  I have used the principle competitor, "Tax Cut: in the past and have found it to have generally a poor UI, but it was significantly better than Turbo Tax.

Some examples of the poor User Interface experience are:

*	If you enter the employer ID number from a W-2 in an attempt to retrieve it from the internet and the retrieve fails, then you are asked to re-enter the same ID number when you enter the W-2 information manually.

*	Investment Sales: I have about 20 stocks I've sold over the past year, but the window only shows 3 at a time (with a scrollbar).

*	On the form page, Schedule D-1 (the continuation form for stock sales) is displayed on the screen with scrollbar if the number of items exceeds the window height, but the scroll bar would not let me scroll to the bottom 2 entries.  Printing these out does however show them

*	When entering a stock sale, you can indicate it is worthless to which Turbo tax will tell you that it will set the sale date to 12/31, regardless of what you entered in compliance with IRS rules.   So on my next stock that was worthless I tried to not enter a sale data knowing it would just override it, but the program insisted I enter a sale data, only to then immediately override it.

*	Entering Federal information was usually clear enough, but an obvious lack of effort is shown in the state returns (PA in my case).  Cryptic questions are asked with no explanation and no useful help.  For example "Enter adjustment to income, and indicate type of adjustment -- the choice for type include OID, ABP, etc. with no explanation of what these are!.  It is not clear whether the amount of the "adjustment" should be an absolute or a delta. Requesting help brings up a screen on an irrelevant topic (penalties for early withdrawal of savings).

*	On my state return, it dragged me through 3 screens for EVERY stock sale I made.   (about 20 of them - so 60 screens).  Since it already had the info from the federal return I was doing nothing other than clicking Continue over and over. Much better would be to present me with a table of all the sales and ask me to check the information there.

*	It transferred information about my stock sales from my Federal to my state return.  However I was only a part year resident of the state and it made no attempt to either calculate, or warn me, that many of the sales would not be taxable events in that state because they were sold when I was not a resident of that state.

In conclusion, while Turbo Tax ultimately did help me get the job done, I think I'll try going back to TaxCut next year

After purchasing this product, I found there were several problems with scanning. I contacted Nuance (who purchased ScanSoft) to ask for assistance from Technical Support. However, I then learned they want $9.95 for each incident when a request is made by email. Not by phone - by email. After putting out a great deal of money for this product, I should not have to pay $9.95 for assistance with each issue that is a problem with their product. Save yourself a great deal of grief and avoid this product. I regret that Amazon does not allow me to give this product "0" stars.

I was a real fan of omnipage until this version. The scanning speed is slug like. The proof reading function has is less functional the version 14, and it tends to forget the scanner settings.

No noticable new features where added from version 14, and this seems to be a new version for the sake of milking the client base

If you spend a good deal of your time doing OCR on books skip this program. It is even slower than the previous version (which was tortoise-like) still screws up the order of columns, is very bad at reading mixed numbers and letters, Takes forever to move through long documents, and just genreally makes you feel like you are back to using a 486 when you are working on a pentium 4. Oh, and don't be fooled by the claim that it can actually create fillable forms. It will take you less time to create it from scratch in Word than to scan it in and then fix all the errors. I'm switching to Kurzweil

I've used Omnipage 12 and 14 and got the latest version to convert an out of print book to a text pdf.  Nothing really fancy, two column text mostly w pictures and captions plus 3 tables. Using this software was a nightmare.  The OCR worked better than the previous version BUT it showed mixed fonts on the page (two column text w a title about 1/3 down and above the text).  No problem I thought, I'll just use the wysiwyg (what you see if what you get) text editor to fix this..it looks very nice w some good features.  Well, wysiyg is more like wysiwyDON'Tget.  I'd fix the fonts, save the file, open it in adobe reader and find that Omnipage had made some startling changes in the fonts/size and the titles.  I tried for 3 hrs to get a simple table of contents page w just a title and 8 lines (each w text followed by a page number)...no go.  Plus the wysiwyg editor would sometimes inexplicably throw me into 'replace text' mode while I was trying to insert text and I couldn't get out.

In frustration I used a friends machine w Abby Finereader 7.0 Pro...what a welcome change.  OCR was at least as fast and accurate and the editor, while not as feature laden as Omnipages, actually worked!  I did in 6 hrs what I'd been trying for well over 12 to do in Omnipage..and that was w/o going thru any of the tutorial info..just loaded it and started.  I'm buying Abby for my next project, they've upgraded to 8.0 and I'll bet it's editor delivers what Omnipage only promises.  I wouldn't recommend Omnipage 15 Pro to anyone

I bought this to convert some .AVI and .MOV files so I could try video podcasting with a web multimedia class I teach.  I've done this successfully with a shareware product, but thought the resulting video could be a little sharper, so I was willing to pay for and try a commerical product.  (Pinnacle, right?  They do a lot of this stuff, they must know what they're doing . . . . )  HA!!!!  HUGE mistake.  The interface is horrible, and the conversion just-plain-sucks.  Everything came out in flouescent colors with huge blocks covering the screen.  Totally, completely unwatchable.  It looks like a 60s psychedellic experience, like "motion art," not like a proper video at all.  Avoid this product!!

I bought this, installed it, patched it, and then started going through the rather incomplete and disorganized documentation. The examples I played around with all worked fine. I started writing my own program, a simple math game with basic sprites and speech. I wrote a simple speech and graphics routine, which mostly worked. I wanted to try to figure out why one of my functions was going into an infinite loop and so I started the Debug mode, so I could watch what the variables were doing (very simple, basic, and common programming practice). Blat - debug mode crashes. Debug mode works on much simpler programs and for the few examples I tried out, but on my 200 line routine it generates exceptions. After the crash, I opened my project and found that everything I had written in my source had been reverted to an old version. I know for a fact that it was saved many times since then, but for some reason it decided to recall an old version for loading, as if all my Saves after an arbitrary point never happened. If I can't run debug mode on my programs or save my sources, then what's the point of this software? Complete and total buggy garbage

Don't be fooled by the box saying how many they've sold anyone who knows anything about software knows you cannot return an opened software box so sold means nothing.
This software in unimpressive, I bought it because I needed to do my wedding invitation and I liked the description thinking I could use it for may other things as well.
Well I ended up using WORD for my invitations, yes WORD, why because word actually did everything I wanted that this program said it would do but didn't! I spent HOURS trying to use it's "simple" templates to no avail they would not print correctly or in the size they claimed to be. In the end I am out the money I spent and pretty mad about it

I bought this to protect my new Dell Axim, a replacement for my Palm Tungsten E (and a step up).  The Axim is wireless enabled so I wanted to protect it.  When I tried to install it, I ran into major issues.  It automatically wanted to install to the Palm (seeing the Palm Desktop software).  There was NO way to override it or choose which device to which it should install.  I contacted Customer Service (an issue in itself) via phone and email.  Emailed response told me to uninstall my Palm software.  How stupid!  I have no intention of uninstalling the Palm just yet.  Meanwhile, trying to PHONE Customer Service was a joke.  I tried a few times, once spending over 60 minutes on hold, another over 90 minutes, with no human contact.  I have a business to run, not plenty of time to waste!  Maybe it works great, but the complications of trying to install prevented me from ever finding out.  Amazon was terrific and let me return the product

I Purchased this product in Nov 2006. Reviews at other sites indicated this was a wonderful product, the very best, editor reviews - not user - the product is to new I guess. I looked at the specs and it had features which looked very appealing, so I thought I would try it - Bummer. Acronis 10 installs fine, sets up a file system on a seperate physical drive and appears to work, until you verify the images, all are corrupted. I have contacted Acronis several times, they have given me several test tools to find out what might be wrong.  Nothing has been resolved after 4 1/2 months. The tools and debuging has shown no errors in my hardware.  I have to keep using Ghost-2003 to do my images, it works fine. Acronis support acts like its a unheard of problem, but I now find references all over the Internet about this image corruption problem going back to version 6

This product is a huge waste of time.  It loaded easily enough, looks friendly, and is feature rich but it just doesn't work !  And support is awful.  Biggest problem is it just would make a good back up image.  Burned many dvd's and the program kept telling me the files were corrupted.  In most cases, I couln't even get confirmation of that.  The program did something to my DVD drive.  It would ask me to swap a spanned set, yet disable my drive !  Process had to be cancelled, whole system rebooted just to get access to my dvd drive again.  When I tried manually checking the files they wouldn't open.  Explore or mounting the images kept requiring a "password".  But I don't use passwords !  Made sure the settings were all password free.  
Stick with Norton Ghost !!!!!

This software is fine for altering digital pictures if you do not have any other programs, but if you want to make exciting slideshows, this software is very basic and not user-friendly.  I had technical problems from the start.  You are better off using MS Powerpoint than this software

...buy it here and save $s!

Shipping cost from the UK added $46.95 to the price AND a Foreign Debit Card Transaction fee of $2.51 for a waste of $49.46 that could have been spent getting additional models.

Or get the download version and save even more as like someone else pointed out, the included manual is near useless and has not improved since version 4. Practical Poser 6 is still the best book to get if you are serious about doing Poser 6 development

I installed Adobe 8.0 at the request of a client in order to view secure docments on-line.  Two serious problems were caused by this: 1) Window 2000 Outlook runing under XP would crash after the Adobe reader was launched. Closing the reader and restarting Outlook would not always fix the problem. Often the computer would require a cold re-boot. 
2). More serious, Adobe 8 installation corrupted my Agilent Technologies Genesys 8 and later (Eagleware) RF simulation software tools.  This resulted in the Genesys simulator to fail to find the authentication file.  Because the correlation between installing Adobe was not apparent considerable amount of time was lost on this project.  Adobe also causes problems with OrCAD 15 license server.

I have currently un-installed Adobe 8 had to re-install and patch previously installed Microsoft and enginnering software tools.

Please see reviews of the previous version 7.0. The Adobe activation process can cause a lot of continuing problems for legitimate users of this software. Too bad such good software is hampered by such a process. Being in the software business, I don't mind companies worrying about piracy and taking some measures but this is a bit too much. You might need to allow the software to access the internet regularly to keep your activation (and not bother you with notices of reactivation) but that also means you open it for Adobe to do their push marketing into their software. I have used Adobe products for over 15 years and have always liked them. Too bad, they have lost the customer focus in their rage for software piracy and greed for intrusive marketing

TaxCut did not warn me that I needed to fill out additional forms required for taking the exemption for a qualified child, nor did it lead me through the Schedule C like TurboTax does. TurboTax may be more expensive, but it's well worth it to save the headaches that this program caused. If you have complicated tax forms or unusual tax situations (or prefer an intuitive program, rather than something that makes you say "What am I supposed to do next???") stick with TurboTax

This program has a bug in processing 1099-R data that makes the whole software package useless to me.  After filling in the data from my 2005 1099-R form, the program informed me that these monies were taxable in 2003 not 2005, and that these data would not be included in my 2005 return.  I could not find a way overide this problem. Also, there was no apparent way to directly contact H&R Block to find out how to fix it.  After wasting a couple of hours I now have to trash the taxcut software and spend more money to purchase turbo-tax, which from prior years experience is relatively bug free.

I got the hang on the 21% and all they could tell me at tech support is to shut down extra services. Well the only services I had running was the security services (firewall and antivirus). As an experiment I tried loading it on two computers set up identically. On one I shut down the antivirus and on the other I shut down the firewall. Neither would install. So I shut down both on both computers and it installed perfectly on both. I cant believe that they want you to shut down security in order to install. Makes me wonder.."What are they hiding that they dont want me to know about". I checked adaware and a registry cleaner and even ran my AV again and found nothing but still... It makes you wonder. Also the layout is very poor, so buggy they have many, MANY patches and updates. Will not print forms correctly and want to charge you fees to e-file when it is free from the governments. They just want more money. 

In my opinion...DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAP. BY THE TIME YOU WASTE YOUR MONEY ON GETTING THIS TO WORK, YOU CAN GET A PROFESSIONAL TO DO IT FOR YOU FOR LESS

I was thoroughly disappointed.  The first few words I looked up in the thesaurus were not listed -- words like upholstery!  When I went online to see what I might be able to glean from their online site, first Fogware had not sent me a coupon, then I had to deal with bad customer service (I am not doing business with any companies anymore that give bad support) then after I finally got the coupon code they had left out of my box, the online info is exactly what we have in the cd -- so save your money and do not subscribe to their extended services site unless you need a spanish online dictionary also!  VERY BAD!  I am now going to go buy Roget's and check it out

Although this dictionary's contents are extensive, the screen functions are relics from the DOS era.  They are laborious and clumsy.  To find a word for difinition, it has to be spelled perfectly, there's no list of proximations to the word entered.  Changing a word selection is also clumsy especially in the thesaurus when the cursor doesn't show up in the entry slot. If someone knows of a better software, I'd sure like to hear cause this thing sucks!!  Maria McGowan

I have been using FrontPage since 1997.  I am webmaster for three websites and have alway really thought this was a great program!  BUT!  I have only upgraded to FrontPage 2000 and find that with my XP computer, Win XP does not support FrontPage.  Now, if I want to continue with my family Genealogy Site and a community Genealogical Society site, I will need to purchase and learn ANOTHER program.  At age 70, I really don't feel like doing that!

Does anyone know if FP 2003 will work on Win XP?  OR  How can I get my FP 2000 to work on my WIN XP computer?

I am not a 'professional,' but figured out how to build a website with this program, which I bought thinking that it was going to help me produce more professional-looking websites/pages, and I invested a bunch of other money in how-to books I'd ordered here, and lo and behold, the server with which I have a website I maintain for my city gov't does NOT support any sites made with this program, and then I find that NEITHER DOES YAHOO where I have my personal site and have been promoting to the city to move their official website to!!!  I've apparently wasted a lot of money and had NO CLUE this would happen when I finally put a website together with this program.  I never would have imagined Yahoo would not support the most current page builders, but it could be they want to force people to use their wizards.  WHY would Microsoft not have a patch available or something to fix this problem so this program can be used for more than just my entertainment spending hours and hours trying to learn it and build something, then find out it was for NOTHING???  Of course, both the server with the city website and Yahoo work with versions up to 2002....but I can't invest another over-$100 for the old version now just for that.  Yeah, it's great....made a pretty page, but only I can see it.  If I could publish with it, I wouldn't have just given it one star here

I gave this a 2nd star for a support call ms provided.  If you do have a frontpage server, and have it set "on", it had some advantages over ftp.

I bought it for use on our family website which is mainly pictures.  I've used 6-8 programs for creating galleries over the years.  I think a perl script using Linux' mogrify worked best.  This works worst!  The free ones w/ the digital cameras beat it.  Frontpage is missing the most fundamental piece to view photos-  A next/previous button.  You can choose from several thumbnail displays including a cool mosaic/colage type thing.  Once you expand it, you must remember the shot you were on, back up, and then click on the next one!  Unbelievable.  

I know what I need for handling photos efficiently.  Flicr has it- cross-tab indexing of the same photo.  I think picassa is close and getting closer.  This wasn't worth the cost of Picassa- FREE

It tells you to check the log.  Well, there are over 85k entries and even if I found the errors I don't see any way to correct the errors. When I try to run it I get "starter MFC Application has encountered a problem and needs to close".  I'll be returning this puppy to Amazon for a replacement

i am underwhelmed with the dvd-rom from britannica. it ia a waste of time 

and money. their main object is to sell britannica with snatches to create

interest.these dvd-roms should be sent free to arouse interest. i now own

EB own words: "Unfortunately, at this time the Britannica software is not compatible with Windows Vista. We are working on developing another version of the 2007 software that will work on Windows Vista and we are planning to release this version in the upcoming months. Please check back with us in another month or so and we should have some more information about the Vista-compatible software. But, it is entirely possible that we will not have Windows Vista compatible version of the 2007 product available and that we will wait until the development of the 2008 software." They do NOT offer a reasonable on-line subscription

Since most of the complaints are from recent switchers I went ahead and bought this because most of their problems don't apply to me (running on PowerPC, no old data to transfer), and because intuit offers a 60 day money back satisfaction guarantee.  Oh, and i downloaded it from their site, saving like 5 bucks.

Here's the thing.  The QFX file that quicken uses to get data from financial institutions is restricted.  My bank offers the download, so i can get the file just fine.  However, part of quicken's import process is an internet check with the bank to see if they "support" mac users.  By support, all that really means is the bank pays quicken to allow mac users to import their QFX files.  If not, you get an error message saying to try the import again later.  There is a hack floating around the 'net that invloves changing some of the text in the QFX file, and it works.  BUT there are cheaper alternatives out there that support the format (moneydance is one) with no fuss.

Aside from this issue, the interface is really bad. It looks like a check register.  If I wanted a glorified spreadsheet in the shape of my checkbook, i would have made one.  The program is not even close to intuitive, which means if you dislike/avoid tracking your finances like me this software will scare you away pretty effectively, making your purchase pointless.

Lastly, the customer support is really very bad.  You basically get canned responses that don't even really address the questions you ask, in semi-broken English.

I'm sure that someone with banks that have mac supported QFX, tons of patience, and is predisposed to dealing with accounting minutiae would find this program useful/powerful.  For me, all the advanced features in the world don't matter if i can't even use the most basic ones

I've been using Quicken for Windows for years.  Since I recently bought a Mac, I thought I'd switch Quicken over from Mac to Windows.  Forget it!  The Mac version is totally incompatible with Windows, you must export your data and then re-import it on the Mac.  This works OK for simple checking / Visa accounts, but it **fails completely** for investment or brokerage accounts.  If you look on Quicken's support site, they say "Reinvest Dividend, Reinvest Income and banking transactions in an investment account must be *manually entered*"  Hello?!  Like I'm going to manually enter 12 years of investment transactions?  With most major products (Adobe Creative Suite, MS Office), the same files work transparently across Mac and Windows.  Quicken's inability to even import the data, nevermind actually opening it, reeks of incompetence.  Stay away from this product

Intuit charges banks extra to support Mac users, and many banks don't pay.  So the convenience of automated transaction downloads is impossible for me on Quicken Mac.  Several other features are lagging behind the Windows version.  And for some inexplicable reason, transferring data between Quicken for Windows and Quicken for Mac isn't complete or straightfoward.

I haven't used competing products, but for Mac users I recommend either running the Windows Quicken version (using Boot Camp or Parallels) or buying another product.  And by all means, let Intuit know that their pricing practices are costing them customers

I purchased this product thinking that it would revolutionize my financial organization -but I should have known better after I have started to read all of the product reviews.

I can't even give a thorough review, since I can't seem to get past even downloading my savings & checking information from my bank.  The incorrect balances are showing, and the register doesn't show all of the transactions that my banking website shows.  I'm finding that I have to actually check my banking website to cross-check Quicken!  To me, that ain't so quick.

I've just spent over 45 minutes on an online "chat" - which was more of a waste of time than anything.  The customer's support suggestions pretty much entailed deleting files, restarting, deleting files, restarting.

10 minutes ago, he wrote this:
Ashish R.: Thank you.
Ashish R.:  Please  give me 2 minutes only.
Stacey: I think I would just like to return the product...
Stacey: It isn't working...
Stacey: are you still there?
Stacey: Right...
Stacey: Hello?

I'm still sitting here waiting.  I want to return this product - DO NOT BUY!

I've been using Quicken for over a decade, and I have to admit it is critical to my personal financial management.  But I had no reason to upgrade from Quicken 2004 until Intuit decided to "break" it and force the upgrade by crippling certain features.  Quicken 2007 for Mac's feature set is not significantly different from the 2004 version, much less 2005 or 2006, and is certainly inferior to Quicken for Windows.  That's bad enough but Quicken 2007 is also WAY less stable than my prior version (I'm using the R2 update).  It crashes frequently.  Bottom line, Intuit should be absolutely ashamed of themselves for putting this garbage on the market.  I for one will never buy another one of their products and recommend the same for everyone else out there

I have to agree with all these reviews already posted. I was getting error messages for Intuit stating that I would not be able to download stock quotes after a certain date, so I ordered a new copy of Quicken for $50 thinking it would be an upgrade. To my amazement, it is exactly the same as Quicken 04, no real developments. I feel very cheated by Intuit. If 04 was only going to be good for a couple of years, they should have disclosed the fact in the first place. If they are going to squeeze money out of loyal customers, I would at least expect and improved product. They are making a real mistake here, as their credibility is now zip. I have been buying TurboTax every year, and have been a loyal Quicken user for many years, but now I think I will look for something else.

I concur with the review that points up the problems with Adobe's new "license manager" method of activation. When you pay as much as you do for this app, or the entire suite, you should not be faced with complete lockup should you have hardware problems, or can't connect to the Internet from "location shooting." I took one star off for this egregious marketing tactic.

That said, this version of Photoshop is superb, an otherwise 5-star app. If you take the time to use the tutorials included in the help (used to be separate folders, with chapters 1 - 4 of the Classroom In A Book, but no more alas), or get one of Deke McClelland's fine tomes and do all the lessons, there is nothing in this app that the novice can't start to use from Day One. With today's point & shoot cameras packing more resolution, and more manual control, into their functions, use of Photoshop becomes more than just a hobby. You can really "rescue" photos that are too dark, too bright, exceedingly color-shifted, from the "cut" folder and still make prints. Further, the Camera RAW functionality allows anyone with a sufficiently functional digicam to touch up snapshots into fine photography.

A warning: you need the fastest processor you can afford (a Core Duo or Quatro will be superb), and as much RAM as your system can take. There is an optional performance plug-in which maximizes performance on systems with more than 1 Gigabyte of RAM. You need AT LEAST that much under Windows XP to get good performance out of PS CS2. If you can use 2GB or more dual-channel memory, that's even better (the dual-channel RAM adds a small boost when handling large file sizes, e.g. Camera RAW image sources). If you don't have these, don't expect Photoshop to act fast. 

Adobe Bridge is a major improvement for this version. It offers superior file and image management functions, and can even do batch editing on images. You can even perform Camera RAW adjustments right from Bridge. Bridge can perform batch processes WHILE YOU EDIT IN PHOTOSHOP. If that isn't cool, I don't know what is. If you doubt me, check out Deke McClelland's PHOTOSHOP CS2 ONE-ON-ONE tutorial for his chapter on using Adobe Bridge. His video introduction (included on a DVD in the book), and chapter on using and customizing Bridge, are terrific introductions.

If you're a user of versions 5.x (as I was), 6, or 7, upgrading to CS2 is a no-brainer. Don't wait. Get it now before the Adobe License Manager gets worse in 2007

Adobe Photoshop has a long history of being the best software in the business.  It's only downside is that it may seem a bit daunting to the beginning user.  There is, however, a plethora of texts, tutorials, learning guides, and even video's to help abate the learning curve

don't get me started on that latter program, argh
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
Nobody, and I mean NObody, could be more of an Illustrator novice & ignoramus than I. Several months ago I was given a licensed copy of Illustrator 9 that a departing coworker had used. Wanting a chance to design the departmental logo that otherwise would've gone to an agency, I raised my figurative hand and volunteered blindly for duty. Having taught myself everything from MS-DOS to TurboCAD, to Photoshop Elements, not to mention Word, Excel, and Powerpoint (don't get me started on that latter program, argh), I figured I could tackle at least the basics of Illustrator 9. Loaded it on my laptop, took it home for a weekend....and just about lost my sanity -- and several fingernails -- trying to learn that confounding program. I managed to produce a few logos, one of which was chosen. But egads, what a big, stinky bear Illustrator 9 was to wrestle. 

When I saw that CS2 had this Live Trace feature, I pleaded with my workplace Santa to get it for me, and WOW! What an overall improvement!! 

Illustrator will still not be as intuitive to pick up as an MS Office product, but this comes darn close. With CS2, they've given us "hot tips" -- little clues about what some of the tools do, that pop up when you mouse over the tool. The intuitive menus are nice too. Also cool is that all the text & paragraph and fill & stroke features, which used to be huge boxes taking up valuable real estate on the screen, are now condensed up on a small horizontal toolbar, like in the Office products ... and when you mouse over them, the screen tips tell you how to expand them. Aaaahh! Finally some help for dunces like me. 

Live Trace and Live Paint are unbelieveably cool. The very first thing I did after loading CS2 was to grab a .jpg photo of a soccer ball off Google Images, and within 20 minutes, without consulting any book or online Help, I'd converted it into a simple graphic image painted into the 2 colors I wanted. 

But as for a great guidebook, the reviewer who suggested Illustrator Visual Quickstart guide by Elaine Weinmann was dead-on. I've bought several other "highly rated" books to try to help me through the confounding quagmire of Adobe products, so I've seen them all. The Visual Quickstart book doesn't have any of that insufferable "wanna-be-a-comic-novel-author" writing, and focuses just on the basics. And it's very literal, with step-by-step instructions. Still there's no substitute for the utterly excruciating process of learning Illustrator through experience. But the Weinmann book's better than any I've seen yet. 

The only reason I haven't given this product a 5 is because it still doesn't have the intuitiveness that it needs. In that way it's still "snobby" -- aimed at pros, not folks like me who need to do occasional design stuff but not for a living. But this is a far, far, far cry better than Illustrator 9. Absolutely worth the money, just for Live Trace and Live Paint alone.

If you're one of those people like me, who hang on to an older version of the application waiting for the right time, now is the time to upgrade.  You won't be disappointed.  Just ask the editors of both PC Magazine and C|Net which awarded this version their Editor's Choice Award.

Once again Adobe has listened to its loyal customer base.  The proof is in the new version of Illustrator.  Many of our requests were answered with the latest version including some that we didn't even think of.  I was happy to find out that even with the new features, Adobe has not altered Illustrator's previous palettes or keyboard commands.  There's nothing worse than having a shortcut or command memorized for years and then it gets changed with a new version.  No fear here!

First of all, I want to say that I am really impressed with the Live Trace and Live Paint features, especially when used together.   We all know that sometimes ideas hit us when we least expect it and are away from our beloved computer.  We end up drawing it out on a napkin, paper towel or the unused envelope from our glove compartment.  Normally, once you get back to your computer you have to try to redraw your graphic using Illustrator which takes both time and effort---not any more.

Take your napkin masterpiece to your scanner and scan it in.  Once the image has been scanned, then the fun begins.  Once the image has been scanned in and brought into Illustrator CS2, use the Live Trace feature to actually trace your drawing.  This feature actually turns to drawing into a Live Trace object for easy manipulation.  After applying some blurring as needed, your traced image is cleared up.  Then, convert your Live Trace object into a Live Paint object using the new Control Palette.  I like the Live Paint tool also because it reminds me of working in Photoshop.

Once you've converted to the Live Paint object, you can easily use the pen and other tools to modify any points to your liking.  Live Paint also has a feature called Gap Detector which can prevents paint from going over into other sections because of a break in a line.  This is a handy feature that keeps you from having to fix overspill later.  When the object outlines are finalized, use the Live Paint feature to easily fill any region with color.  Voila!  You are done.  Go from napkin to art in a matter of minutes.

A concern of many of us for years was the fact that while Illustrator keep getting better and newer features, it also mean more and more palettes.  Sometimes it became a little unmanageable.  However, the pros at Adobe recognized this problem and applied a solution - the Control palette.  This new palette sits at the top of the screen.  First, it acts as a an object inspector providing information.  Secondly, (and more importantly), the Control palette provides easy access to fill and stroke dropdown menus, brush shape, opacity, and style.  No longer do you have to fumble through your palette to get at these frequently used features.  If you are fans of Adobe's other Creative Suite 2 software, you will be pleased to learn that the Control Palette is apart of their new makeover too.

Here are some more new additions and changes to Illustrator:

*	Like Photoshop, Illustrator CS2 now supports custom workspaces.  You can display only the palettes you need at any time. You are also able to access or save any workspace at any time or use workspace templates.
*	Adobe has improved the Swatch and color integration.  Now, working with the other Creative Suite 2 programs is seamless.
*	Isolation Mode is a feature that allows you to double-click a group move and edit internal objects without having to search through the Layers Palette.
*	CS2 now supports all of the latest Wacom tablets. It now provides brush support for the new Wacom 6D Art Pen and adds a new dimension Illustrator's Calligraphic and Scatter brushes
*	Adobe Bridge integration is now a part of Illustrator CS2.  Bridge allows you to easily manage images through thumbnails for better workflow.
*	Macromedia Flash exports are now available.  You can export both text and objects as Flash files which result in smaller file size and easier incorporation into web projects.
*	You can now open Photoshop files with layer comps within Illustrator.  This new feature allows you to view many versions of a layout at one time, just as you do in Photoshop
*	Custom stroke placement is a new addition to Illustrator. You can now place strokes on the outside, inside or center of a path.
*	Underline and Strikethrough are two of over 170 new type enhancements.
*	These are a few of the new features!

The $169 upgrade cost is well worth the money, just for the Live Trace and Live Paint features alone.  However, you get so much more in the new Illustrator CS2.  Upgrade now and be completely satisfied.  If you haven't purchased a vector graphics program, get Illustrator, especially if you are already an owner of a version of Photoshop.  This new version of Illustrator even looks more like the familiar Photoshop layout.

I've been frustrated for quite some time now with having Adobe Reader and expecting it should do what Adobe Acrobat can do.  I was especially interested in creating PDF's (Portable Document Formats)of Word documents.  Although I have Photoshop that can do this for me in a roundabout way, I wasn't satisfied with the extra time it took to do so.  Faced with the assignment of pulling together a rather large family cookbook, aptly named, "Death by Cholesterol", I felt justified in finally purchasing not only "Acrobat" but also "OmniPage", an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software.  With these programs in hand it made the project fun to do.  Now I have the whole cookbook with its index as a sinle multi-page PDF file that can be read and also printed out by anyone I care to send it to over the Internet.  It's of great value to me now and gives me enhanced versatility even though I've only used a small part of its capabilities.  The reason that I've only given it a "4" rating?  I'm upset that I didn't get the full version, but I can't justify doing so.  I'm being petulant

I have been using Adobe Acrobat for a few years now.  I've used both their Professional and Standard versions.  Now, Adobe has released Acrobat 7.  In this review, I will be discussing primarily the features of the Standard edition.  However, these features are also available in the Professional edition.  Outside of the fact that the Professional version has more workgroup-oriented and enterprise features, these programs are the basically same.  I have noted any features available only in Professional in this review.  

First, what is PDF and what can it do for me?
Adobe's PDF is now a universal format that allows you to preserve the look and integrity of your original documents - Adobe PDF files look exactly like the original pages and fulfill requirements for electronic filing and document security.

Not only that, but you can share the files with anyone, whether on a PC or a Mac.  Each PDF file has the graphics and fonts imbedded into the file.  The user of  the file does not have to have the same font set, nor even purchase Adobe Acrobat, because the Reader version of Acrobat is free!

New Features in Acrobat 7
*	Turn MS Outlook email into searchable documents.  This is a great feature.  It allows you to effortlessly turn those old emails into the universal PDF format.  Acrobat's searching capabilities make even searching through the longest emails easy and accurate.
*	Attaching source files.  Previously, we have been able to create  PDFs from spreadsheet and other formats.  Now, not only can you do that, but this new feature allows you to attach the documents with the PDF!
*	Improved Browser.  Acrobat's browser has been improved to make searching for documents easier.  If you are familiar with the Adobe Photoshop browser, you'll like the new upgraded browser in Acrobat 7.
*	Searching improved.  The search feature has been improved when you are looking for files.  It is easier to search for files, because now Adobe has made the feature more friendly.  You can search by document and text properties on your local computer or across your companies LAN or WAN networked drives.

More About Acrobat
Although many people are familiar with the Acrobat Reader program, they are not as familiar with Acrobat itself.  I consult will many business persons and they are just astounded at what Acrobat 7 can actually do for their business.  Just the fact that you can collect and assemble output from different types of programs into on universal format floors them every time!  

Another great point about assembling the documents in Acrobat is the compression factor.  With Acrobat, users are able to compress the original documents, thus saving space and making it more efficient to transmit the documents via email or internet downloads.

This new version can now also create, and save "PDF/A" files for archiving and it allows users to  scan paper documents directly into a searchable PDF file saving space and time.  Many companies around the country are making the jump to the "paperless" environment.  Acrobat 7 can definitely help.

In fact, I know of an attorney's office making great use of Acrobat.  They have almost converted their entire office to a paperless organization by using Acrobat because of its form creation, reviewing, commenting, approval and signature features.  In paper document storage space alone, this office is saving thousands of dollars per year.  Even legal documents can be approved, digitally signed and verified in Acrobat.

Anyone concerned about the security of their documents has nothing to fear.  Acrobat's security features including the ability to create self-signed digital IDs are terrific; no matter if you have PDF documents loaded on your website for downloading to clients or if you are emailing the files.  For Professional users, Adobe has added a new feature called E-envelopes.  With the new E-Envelopes, user can package their PDF files in an encrypted wrapper and send those files securely via email.  For company networks, Adobe has also added support for your company-wide security policies using a new feature called Lifecycle Policy Service.  The granularity of the security allows the user to pick exactly what they will allow the recipient of the file to do like printing, copying, pasting and so on.  

Many people are also surprised that Acrobat isn't just for static documents.  Users can create interactive forms (Professional Only) as well.  In fact, I know a client who is an attorney.  They have almost converted their entire office to a paperless organization by using Acrobat because of its form creation, reviewing, commenting, approval and signature features.  In paper document storage space alone, this office is saving thousands of dollars per year.

For CAD and graphics professionals who work with 3D files, Acrobat 7 (Professional Only) can now convert these into PDF format for ease of viewing, whether in electronic or printed format.  This will allow the users to quickly send their clients views of the 3D object in the universal PDF format without the purchase of additional software for the recipient of the file.
Another feature is the new licensing capability that Adobe has added to Acrobat 7.  You can install the program and activate it on two separate computers, which is great if you work at home and at the office as well.  Need to install it on a third computer?  Not a problem.  The transfer activation feature allows you to transfer the license to another computer.  To do this, deactivate one copy and transfer the activation via a simple menu command. If your computers have internet access, the change happens right away.  This feature alone may save users money on purchasing multiple copies of the software.
Summary
I would highly recommend this product to anyone in business.  The easy of use and versatility of Adobe Acrobat 7 make it an indispensable tool,  whether you are a legal professional, an IT company, accounting firm, healthcare company or anyone else in business.
This is one investment where the ROI will definitely outweigh the purchase price of the software within weeks of normal use.  The ability to go paperless and save valuable office space that is now gobbled up by filing cabinets, paper binds and closets alone should make the difference for almost any company.
Testing Setup
To conduct tests of the software, the following hardware was used:
PC Compatible System (2 GHz Athlon Processor, 512 MB Ram, 30 GB HD)
Epson Scanner/Fax/Printer
HP LaserJet 8150DN Printer
For software tests (conversion to PDF format), the following software was used:
MS Office 2003 (Word, Excel, Outlook)
Photoshop CS

Its a great GPS once its starts and detects the satellites (sometimes it can take up to 5 mins). I used it with iGuidance and that software is the whole world of difference. I can actually hear what the direction are saying vs the software that came with the GPS unit (robotic sounds, need to subtitle that for me PLEASE!)

I used this program on a 5-state road trip of the Midwest, and while overall it was  "adequate," it had some key shortcomings.

The bad stuff:

First, this is not an especially user-friendly program; there is a steep learning curve to operate it with ease and predictability. Spend a LOT of time playing with this BEFORE using it as a primary navigator! A lot of the commands are not intuitive, and you need to go through a lot of menus to figure things out. This can be a problem when you are on the road looking to get somewhere. It doesn't have a lot of clickable buttons on the main screen. For example, to get the program to TALK to you, you must be on a certain tab at the bottom of the screen. If you are on any other of the many tabs, the program doesn't talk to you or show you the turns. It took me HOURS to figure this out! The help function was useless.

Second, the tracking can be very slow, and as a result you can easily overshoot your turns--especially when there are no physical street signs in many areas of the country--which happened to me numerous times. Many times the screen showed me I had a lot farther to go before the scheduled turn, and this caused me to overshoot it when there was no sign.

Third, the "rerouting" function is AWFUL and perhaps the biggest problem with this program: if you stray from the route--even to pull off and get gas--the program flips out and keeps trying to route you back to the original route even if that route is not the easiest or most direct. I have not found a way for it to manually or automatically calculate a new and different route. I also have found no way to modify a route once you begin the route (see below).

Several times in several different cities, the re-routing function was totally wrong--spitting out names of streets that weren't even on the screen at close zoom level. This is a really annoying glitch, and it happened without fail every time I strayed from the route. Once off route, there is no way to hush the program from yelling at you that you're off route, and there is also no way to easily have the program recalculate a CHANGE in the route. When there is construction that you didn't anticipate, for example, this program sucks at being able to change the route once you've started on it. Very annoying. There is no construction updater plug-in, which would be helpful for long term construction projects that go on forever. 

Fourth, the program does NOT audibly warn you if you are going the wrong way on a one way street. This actually happened to me, as there were no "one way" signs on a particular street in Springfield, IL. Though there were green arrows on the screen to indicate one-way, but the voice commands didn't warn me that I actually WAS going the wrong way, so had I not been looking at the screen, I wouldn't have known. You can't always look at the screen when driving. And in Iowa on I35, construction brought northbound drivers over to the southbound lanes. I was heading north in the southbound lanes (as I was supposed to) but there was no visual or audible indication that I was going the wrong way! Big time safety issue here.

Fifth, the search function is wholly lacking and is not easy to use. I needed to find a police station while in Missouri--no such luck. I also needed to find the state fairgrounds in Missouri (which I later came across on the screen) but it did not show up when I intentionally searched for it. Search limitations are the second biggest problem with this program.

Sixth, several times the screen showed me "off route" in a totally blacked-out area with no roads around me when I was in fact on a U.S. highway or interstate. Something wasn't communicating correctly. Other times the screen showed me more than 1000 feet off the highway even though I was certainly on the highway. In Illinois, the screen showed I was pretty much driving through corn fields even though I was on a U.S. Route. This problem is pronounced on multi-lane highways. If you're not in the center lane, often the program indicates you're off route. Very annoying.

Seventh, the zoom level does not stay constant; it fluctuates automatically between high zoom and far-out zoom. I wanted high zoom most of the time to see all the minor roads and landmark indicators, but the program kept zooming out and in every few minutes.

Eighth, the help function is a joke. It is totally lacking in substantive information. The program should come with a separate DVD movie showing how to use it.

Ninth, the program does not recognize a lot of road name synonyms. For example, some U.S. Routes also have county/state/local designation numbers and/or an alphabetic name, but the map often only listed one or two of the many "also known as" names/numbers. This can be quite problematic when the signs on the roads don't match up with the turn commands (e.g. "Turn left on U.S. route 40," when the only street signs showed an alphabetic name and no numbers. This was also quite annoying.

Tenth, the antenna that comes with the program SUCKS. Without fail, I would get a red "no signal" indicator in every city I was in where there were high-rise buildings. This happened in Kansas City, Des Moines, Indianapolis, and Springfield. If you are in a city, you risk having no GPS tracking ability. And yes, my antenna was mounted as recommended. At one point I held it up through my open sun roof with no success.

Eleventh, the main-screen buttons are way too small for use while driving if the laptop is on your passenger's seat. You pretty much have to pull over OR risk crashing to see what you're clicking on. Yes, I'm aware that the disclaimer for the program states you should have a separate navigator to operate the program while driving. I'm also aware that almost no one who uses this program actually has a navigator/operator.

Twelfth, trip planning is lacking. When you input a starting and ending point, the program gives you ONE route. There is no way to easily plan alternate routes or to preview them. True, you can do things like program it not to take you on toll roads, but this function is not easy to use. Several times the program kept me off the interstates when I wanted to be on them, and sometimes it kept my on the interstates when I wanted to be on U.S. or smaller county roads (for sightseeing purposes). I would have to go off route and listen to the program whine about being off route.

Thirteenth, I emailed a list of my concerns/constructive criticisms/recommendations to the folks at Delorme. Never heard back from them, which does concern me as a quality issue.

Ok, so there were some redeeming qualities:

First, *in general* the GPS tracker was on-target. For about 95% of my 2000-mile trip, I knew where I was and the program operated just fine. Just realize that this program (as well as GPS in general) has a lot of limitations, ESPECIALLY when there is bad weather or you are in a woodsy area or place with a lot of obstructions.

Third, you can easily add points of interest and comments yourself. I used this function a lot to mark places where I want to return to take photos in daylight.

Fourth, there is a selectable function to show high contrast colors (black background with bright road colors). This is quite helpful.

In summation, for the money this program is a good deal, but do NOT rely on it (or any GPS program) as your *sole* source of road information/navigation. If I hadn't had my Rand McNally paper road atlas and back-up state and city maps I borrowed from the library, I would have been in big trouble several times.

There are a LOT of ways this program can and should be improved, but in the meantime I'd still recommend it despite the problems. Knowing the limitations that I've listen can save you time and frustration. There is no better alternative IMHO for the price. It's possible that some of my complaints DO have fixes, but you wouldn't know it from the crappy help function.

This is my first experience with GPS.  This product makes using it a simple experience with on board instructions.  Viewing the screen on a Laptop as opposed to most of the Portable GPS units is a definite advantage to the user.  I would purchase another immediately if the need arose.

It took so long for this to come out...I hated the little hints they gave us hardcore NDers on the Dare to Play message board. I had extremely high hopes for this game--I adored Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon and waited AGES for this game.

Now, besides the absurd level of difficulty in this game [it was seemingly VERY hard in my eyes--I could not make it the first time through without the assistance of a walkthrough], I LOVED it. The flight to Paris and the travel about the city--it was also a LOT easier to make money in this game than in Secret of the Old Clock.

I did not like how hard the puzzles were, but all in all it was an amazing game. There was a lot of talking, and that can really slow down gameplay and frustrate a gamer. And puzzles like the darkroom, the paintbomb and the cookies were absurdly difficult. But otherwise it was worth it

These are a favorite in the home. Even though we have all of them, they   are each different and provide hours of entertainment. Skills are learned while solving puzzles some include spatial manipulation of puzzle pieces and roman numerals. Great source of fun and learning. Also a desire to read the actual book and see what is different and the same between book and game

I really enjoy the Nancy Drew games. They can be done as a senior detective with fewer helps or as a Junior detective with a check list of things that need to be done. The check list continues to update as you move through the game. I look forward to each new game as it comes out and can't leave the computer until they are done

Previously I owned ColorVision's Spyder2 program and was quite satisfied with it.  It did not include, however, a program for correcting the printer's color rendition. The new Spyder2Pro includes PrintFix Plus.  This along with the monitor correction Spyder2Pro works very effectively.  I am very happy with the program. For the price it is a great addition to Photoshop editing.  The Spyder program allows the monitor and printer to show a print that reflects what the user has taken in his digital camera. I have not found any particular negatives about the program.  In the past I have used their tech service for fine tuning the program.  They were very responsive and helpful.

I have read several reviews and decided the Spyder2Pro would be a good monitor color calibrator for me.   I have a Samsung 970P monitor with all adjustments via software.   The calibration process is very simple and all you have to do is follow the menu of questions during the calibration process.
I like the Spyder2Pro and would recommend it highly.

I am very happy with it but it doesn't live up to my expectations.
I also have the reg. Plus for XP and I really don't think the extra money is worth it.  If I were to do over I would still have bought the Plus superpack for XP but not the regular Plus just because I do have a Media Center PC. If I didn't have that the regular Plus for XP would have been just fine

This is an easy product to use.  It saves you when a disk drive fills up and you want to use the same partiction but need more space.  It will grab it from another hard drive.  It is also useful in setting up a D: drive for Documents, and and E: drive for programs.  It is useful to have windows on C: alone.  There are fewer crashes.

It has some nice upgrades from version 6.  It is quicker than the previous version. Highlighting text is a bit easier.   It caused a few problems with my officejet 5510xi and its ports, but I found a patch for the officejet and all is well.  It is a product that is helpful in my work

The new Adobe Acrobat has a cleaner look and feel, and is more user-friendly.  I especially apreciate the new quick distiller buttons in any Microsoft application, which allow you to create a PDF in one click rather than having to go to File and Print. Some functionality as before, with some new organization and better look/feel

I upgraded from Version 5. I don't use very many of the features. But the big difference I see is, files sizes seem to be greatly reduced. Something I would scan and be 10mb, now might be 2mb. This is just opinion, nothing scientific. The interface takes some getting used to, a bit different. Overall for the price ($99 - Less $20 Rebate), a great deal

I find that the new version 7 of Adobe Acrobat loads faster than version 5, both stand-alone and within my internet browser.  Also, the new version is better integrated with the browser and with Microsoft Office.  I believe Adobe heard and responded to the complaints about version 6.  There are many other features which I have yet to try but certainly look worthwhile.  Kudos for what I see as a substantial improvement.  I recommend

&#65279;Sandra; hope you get to read this before giving up on this great little program.
Check your printer drivers and spooler.  I'm as close to a computer guru as you'd want having
played with computers in general and PC's in particular since the heady early days of Sinclair,
Kildall, and Adam Osborne.  Installed Hallmark Card Studio on my beloved's machine several
years back.  Was immediately impressed with how thoughtfully programed for the beginner - my
lady took to it immediately - and yet how full featured it was for an advanced user (only wish
could import export data to other address books, and wouldn't it be great to have a Palm
conduit?!-)(I digress!-).
Every new version just gets better to the point 2004 has close to two gigs of cards and imagery.
In short, Sandra Hallmark Card Studio 2004 IS A KEEPER.

Now, approve of your using 98SE, I recommend to my students (yes I teach computing) not to go
beyond 98SE and certainly not to connect anything from MS to the InterNet beyond 98SE (little
thing code name of Palladium!-(
There can be problems with corrupting printer drivers and notably spool32.  Try removing your
printer under START &#62;SETTINGS &#62;PRINTERS, restart your computer with the printer on and
reinstall.  Hope this helps and you learn to enjoy this little gem of a program.  HB

This program is fantastic. It's super easy to use and has a calendar that will notify you of upcoming events/holidays/etc. There are loads of pre-made cards to choose from or you can edit them to your needs. You can also make your own card without any help. The same thing for envelopes! 

There are also quite a few additional projects included. You can create your own stationary sets (paper and envelopes), awards and certificates, kid's activity pages and more.

I highly recommend this program if you're a beginner card maker. I mostly bought this (I was a beginner) to save money on cards and in the 2 months I've had this program, it has more than paid for itself. It's much more convenient than going to the store, WAY cheaper and I really like being able to make matching envelopes.

I bought this package because my daughter needed to be able to do word processing and make presentations for school.  I used it because its what is being used at my office.  I wish they had included Frontpage instead of One Note (which I really haven't been able to find a use for).  Otherwise, it works the same as other MS Office packages I've used in the past

I have been running Windows XP SP2 and would "never" want to go back to Windows ME or Windows 98. With the XP, I rarely need to re-boot my system, and my PC no longer freezes up. There is a built-in Windows Firewall plus a pop-up blocker which are both awesome. The system is much safer, and I have NEVER had a virus, worm, or trojan horse while running the Windows XP Home with a good internet security/virus program.

One thing: Make sure you have at least 256 mb of space available in your PC before starting to download, as this does require at least that.

Get it! You won't be disappointed

I have been using Microsoft Operating Systems for a very long time, and, i still say that this is the best System out there, for many reasons.

An increasing amount of Linux and Mac users have made the claim that they are more compatible with programs, and are less vulnerable to virus and hacks.

In Response to Linux Users-
Stay away from Linux, Linux is free for a reason. It is compatible with very very few programs as it is, and that number will only decrease. For Gamers - Rarley do i see a Linux compatible game. Just stay away from this system.

For Mac Users-
Mac's also have a lesser amount of compatible programs. Fewer and Fewer programs can run on them, and like linux, that number will only decrease. The only thing keeping Macintosh alive is Itunes. Which is compatible with Windows. Besides, When Direct X 10 Comes out, it will only be available for Windows, making Macintosh's un-usable for new games when the next windows OS comes out (Microsoft Vista). The computers are also generally more expensive than Windows.  Btw - You can get viruses on Mac's

I have been running XP for a few days and so far so good. I was running win98se and decided to upgrade after microsoft announced that they no longer support win98. My software is now obsolete? Yikes! Well, I'm glad I upgraded.

Installation went smooth as silk and I have not experienced any problems at all. I had to find a couple of new drivers for hardware but that's been it. And for Home Edition versus Pro, I think I can be quite happy with the Home Edition.

I will say that win98se had been a headache for a long time so the stability that I see so far with XP Home is a relief.

Good features, good reliability. A very decent upgrade. I recommend it. Four stars

Simple. It loads like a blaze. Sure all the new frills and features like easy annotations are neat, but the speed of 7.0 alone makes it worth every dime. Especially if your current Acrobat is the half-baked clunky 6.0.x that burst through the gates before it had legs.

Honestly, I don't know how much more they can improve Adobe Acrobat.  It is an excellent product, and a god-send for electronic file management.

I upgraded from version 6.0.  The only problem I had with 6.0 is that it seemed terribly slow.

This new version seems much brisker.  It loads quickly, and files seem to "print" to it much more quickly than version 6.0.  I do not utilize the "one-button" feature it provides in MS Office and other programs.  I try to keep all my programs as non-integrated as possible, because my previous experiences showed that they really, really bog each other down, no matter how much their makers claim they won't.

I don't come close to using all the features of Acrobat, but for my needs, it far surpasses anything else I've tried (or researched).

If you're having problems with version 6.0, or have an older version that you just want upgraded, I strongly recommend this.  However, I don't foresee ever needing to upgrade Acrobat again

I have been using v.7 from the last week or so and i am very pleased with it. It loads very fast (unlike all other adobe versions), the conversion to PDF from doc or ppt files also is much quicker. 

I have not encountered any problems yet, but its only been 7 days since i am using it..

Definitely worth the upgrade

Version 6 seemed to go off the track by changing many users' favorite features, like form ordering along with how unattractive bookmarks had become. More than anything, version 7 increases one's ability to collaborate securely, providing complete control over your document, who can open, print, or even comment on it. But version 7 is more of a fix than a major upgrade, as it cures many of the ills of the previous version. Best of all, Adobe has kept the price the same. Very nice

First, if you're thinking about using these photos for print, you may wish to think again.  Most objects run between 300-600 pixels in width or height, or 1-2 inches at 300 DPI.  Stretch them bigger than that, and they'll start to blur and/or get jagged.

Also note, that if you try to export/save an image from the Hemera Image browser and select the 300 DPI setting, the browser may stretch the graphic larger than it's actual size, causing blurring and jaggedness right out of the gate.

You need to use the "Use Image's Full Size" checkbox when exporting images.  If you specify a 300 DPI size, and don't use that checkbox, you'll get a stretched image.  

For example, the first image in the collection (the pocket watch) is only 384 pixels wide. If you specify 300 DPI and don't check the "Use Image's Full Size" box, the software will stretch it to 642 pixels wide.  The stretching will cause the image to look fuzzier and/or more jagged when you use it in a web site or print project.

All that said, if you're going to use the images for the web, they're great.

You get almost all the images you'd find in their three "Photo Objects" collections, each of which is much more expensive than this single collection.  The difference is the Photo Objects collections offer about 20-30% higher resolution (i.e. the first image in the collection is 384 pixels wide, but is 492 pixels wide in Photo Objects) and you can save the Photo Objects images with transparent backgrounds (while this collection forces you to specify a color for the background).

For the price, this is a good collection.  There are lots of shots with minor variations, so it may seem like duplication, but for someone trying to get something just right, that slightly different tilt of the head may be just what the doctor ordered

Some other people have complain about the quality, if you're a print graphic artist then its problem.  As a web designer who need 2" by 2" graphics, this set is great.  You do get a variety of photos of objects.  For example, there's like 20 different examples of a live garnade, something like several hundred coins from different countries.  For $17 this is definitely worth the money.

I've found it is best to export the image to a graphic editor.  Then from there, make it transparent, resize it, and compress it to your wishes.  There's a fair amount of "People" graphic, but not as much as I'd like.  I don't have the 100K collection so don't know if there's any image overlapse between this and that collection.

Quality is pretty nice for small prints and great for web.  Especially superb for smaller projects like christmas cards and so forth, but not good if you want to print high resolution photographs on large paper.

For $17 this is the best collection I've ever bought, Photo Objects II is still in shipping, so can't compare quality with that collection yet.

OneCare is not a tweaker's friend. It has no knobs and gizmos for power users to tinker with. However, it does one thing right. It works. When you use it, you truly do have one care. Do what it tells you to make it green. If you can do that, your computer is safe from viruses, hackers, malware, spyware, known security vulnerabilities, low disk space, slow disk access, and data that is not backed up.
OneCare takes a layered approach to keep you and your data safe. It has an inbound firewall to keep bad stuff out of your computer. If bad stuff gets through the firewall, it has antivirus to stop it from affecting your system and an outbound firewall to keep it from spreading. If that doesn't stop the bad stuff, it makes sure you have a backup of your data on a separate drive or on CDs.
In the past, I haven't bought security products. There are plenty of free ones on the market that do a satisfactory job. However, ever since I tried OneCare as a beta tester, I fell in love with it. It is simple to use.
Reduce your worries about being online down to OneCare and try it today. You can even install it on other computers to help keep friends and family protected

Great SW, easy to learn, and good graphics.  Really helps visualize the space when you can see it 3D. 

Could be improved if numerous similar objects could be selected and changed simultaneously (e.g., windows, doors, cabinets to get all with the same materials, colors, & hardware rather than one at a time - very labor intensive).  Should warn users to select/create a style and then copy/paste them where needed.

Also, difficult (maybe impossible, because I haven't figured out how to do it) to change a room's/house's overall style once you start a given design

There are complaints about Win XP SP2 being too expensive or complaints about technical problems.

It is too expensive, but it is the standard at so many companies, big and small, around the world.

I just wanted to say that anyone who gives Windows XP SP2 a one star rating really doesn't understand much about the Windows operating system, and therefore you should not take into consideration their uneducated opinion about operating systems in general.

The price is a bit high, but Windows is what it is...  a dominant operating system

I do not why the others had these problems with Windows XP. I have run this program since it came out 2001? Except for the danger of attack by viruses, I have had no trouble as long as enough RAM is installed. A minimum of 500-750 is essential. With the addition of antivirus software and service pack 2, I feel fairly secure.

I ordered the box version from Amazon, instead of the download from the manufacturer not only because it was less expensive, but the main reason was so that I would have a paper manual. So many programs don't come with hard copy manuals and I prefer them over on-line help. 

As for the program itself, I trialed a download first. For me, the thing I fell in love with was the ability to call up multiple images, side by side, and compare them! It makes selecting the best image a breeze - a HUGE timesaver. You also have the ability to swiftly zoom in to check focus at full rez. Another wonderful thing is that putting the curser over one of the preview images, and sliding it, will slide all the open previews simultaneously, so you don't have to individually zoom and move each image. You can do this with up to 6 images at a time! You can also do a quick histogram check by hitting the "h" key, which makes it easy to toss off bad exposures at the same time as the review. While you've got the previews open you can hover the mouse over them and hit any # key to color-code the image. The colors can be keyed to whatever description you want. I do "1=green" for yes, "2=yellow" for maybe, and "3=red" for no. There's room for quite a few more colors after that. I then hit the sort key back in the main screen and quickly select all the red "no" images and delete them. After I have all my green "yes" images, I then review them 6 at a time to give them star ratings. I resort by rating and now all the best images are at the top of the page and I can start processing them. 

You can batch process file name, and some other things that I don't bother with, as well. It's got some nice keywording ability and you can easily sync the keywords with your Photoshop files. What's incredibly nice is that you can click on any word in the keyword list and all the images you own, with those keywords, are immediately shown in thumbnails! Finding an image is actually fun! It will even give you thumbnails of images you don't even store on your hard drive anymore! 

Fantastic program - I highly recommend it! The only reason I didn't 5 star it is b/c it's not all that intuitive. This is a read-the-manual kind of program, but you can do an awful lot with it without having to get too far in the book. ;)

I downloaded the demo of this program and although I am by no means a pro photographer I do have over 4,000 digital photographs of my family and I am taking new photos each day. In addition I post my photos on Pbase so family and friends can always see the latest photos.  I started looking into Digital Asset Management after I started to fall behind on updates of the Pbase photo website because of the time consuming process of managing my collection. In case you have not looked, there are products out there such as Idimager, Imatch, Extensis Porfolio, and many more. I downloaded demos of Imatch and Iview Media Pro and used each only briefly. Although Imatch costs only $49.00 or so and Iview costs about 3x more (around $160) I chose Iview because I felt the interface was just easier to use. Of course this says nothing about the features in each product and I am not attempting a feature by feature comparison because I don't have the time. I do think that Imatch is an excellent product and the few features I am looking for appeared to be available in both products. I recommend that anyone looking to purchase software attempt to download a demo first

This is an all around awesome product. I have had great experiences with the program, and use it very often as we use it to create our entire high school's yearbook. Anyone one who says it doesn't have the basics is pretty much lying to you, it has anything you'll ever need and more. The people who review this product poorly do so because they don't know how to use everything in it. 

The only problem I've ever had is learing everything you can do with it, otherwise it is perfect

Tighter Integration Now Possible with InDesign CS2

Adobe has totally re-done the interface to streamline it and make it cleaner from versions prior to CS.  If you are a QuarkXpress user, you'll find that in InDesign CS2, you get the feeling that it is laid out in a logical and easy-to-use manner.  The tools and tool palettes are where you'd expect them to be in the menu structure and on the screen.  Small touches like being able to save your workspace, like you can do in Photoshop CS2, are great.

I tested the integration between InDesign CS2 and some of its counterparts in the Adobe Creative Suite Premium.  I created different graphics in Photoshop CS2 and Illustrator CS2 and I found it was really easy to import them into InDesign CS2 and use.  You can effects like drop shadows and feathering to images directly in InDesign CS2.  No need to go to another program.  With the Control Palette you can also resize objects too.  This palette functions with Transform and Stroke features for graphics, and it includes paragraph, character and table features for text editing.  What the palette does is affected by the type of selection you have made - either graphic or text. 

I imported some formatted text in from Microsoft Word 2003 and two different tables in from Microsoft Excel 2003.  I was concerned how the tables would appear after the import from Microsoft Excel.  The tables imported easily. With InDesign CS2, you can now automatically style Microsoft Word files on import by mapping Word styles to InDesign CS2 styles as well.

An issue for a long time has been how to preview or view other types of files that you want to incorporate with InDesign CS2.  Now, Adobe "bridges" that gap.  Bridge now comes as a part of InDesign CS2 and the Premium Suite.  So, viewing any Adobe-type formatted file or standard graphic format is easy to do.  Using the same interface between the different programs is a help as well.  Adobe Bridge is a standalone program.

Being a Web Designer and using Adobe (formerly Macromedia) Dreamweaver 8, I was familiar with using Snippets.  These are portions of code you can save for use in other programs or you can export them to give to someone else.  Now,  InDesign CS2 offers this Snippet capability.  You can export objects as snippets. These objects can be shared or reused in other documents. Simply place or drag a snippet into a layout, and  InDesign re-creates the original objects, their formatting, and their relative positioning on the page.  No more wasted time redesigning, just to get something you have brought in from another document to fit.

InDesign CS2 also now has an Info palette that is just like those found in Photoshop and Illustrator.  Size dimensions and resolution are immediately available by selecting the graphic and simply glancing over to the Info palette.  This is a crucial tool when fitting graphics in a specifically space-limited area.  It's important to know the actual dimensions with which you are working.

Sometimes in designing and re-designing printed work, you have to move objects.  When this happens, your structure can often change in different ways.  InDesign CS2 helps you maintain your layout by allowing you to anchor your callouts, pull quotes, margin notes, and graphics to text. You can now precisely control the positioning of Anchored Objects, apply text wrap settings, and more.

As with other Adobe products, it is very easy to export your finished work in PDF format.  InDesign CS2 works so well at exporting to PDF, it even maintains the layers in Acrobat 7.  You can pre-define your Acrobat export settings as well.  InDesign CS2 also supports specialty PDF formats like PDF/X-1a and PDF/X-3, which are used in workflows.  It also supports high-resolution CMYK output and color-managed workflows.

If you are familiar with previous versions of InDesign, the upgrade to the new version is easy.  InDesign CS2 is even backwards compatible CS.  You will find that your learning curve is greatly decreased.

This is the easiest way I've ever been able to make CD's. It realy makes photo CD's easy and produces a great product. A group of frinds and Us just got back from Mexico and I put all of everyones photos in separate files on a CD. The automatic slide show goes through the differn't files as if they were just one file with no seperation, but the pictures are still separated in each person's file for ease when printing and so forth. It's great, wish I would have had this years ago

I have used this software from the very first as a PaintShop product and it still delivers. It has improved with this version. I reckon I have tried all other albums and quick editors but this remains the best. For more detailed work a more expansive editor is needed but that is not the purpose of this program. What it claims to do, it does well. If only it had some way of adjusting the mid tones. A simple histogram would make this a top ranking program

If you decide to buy a current greeting card program, there are really only two front-line choices: Art Explosion Greeting Card Factory (currently version 5) or Hallmark Card Studio (currently 2006). There are other programs available specifically for creating cards, but most of them are low quality and outdated, and aren't really worth considering. (A competitive third product featuring American Greetings designs is sadly now long outdated; the designs in the American Greetings program were of similar quality to those in the Hallmark package).

So how do these two products match up? Without a question, if you are looking for quality "canned" cards, the Hallmark program wins. The Hallmark designs are professional, and are equal in quality to cards you would purchase in a store. In contrast, the designs in Art Explosion are adequate but surely NOT up to the quality of a store-bought card. The Hallmark program is also able to simply and correctly print to several different types of card store (although you are stuck with the choices pre-programmed into the software unless you want much frustration). The Art Explosion does a poorer job of correctly and simply printing to a variety of card stock and configurations.

Art Explosion beats the Hallmark program in editing options (more extensive), and in the amount of additional art (clipart, etc.) included with the package.

If you do not plan to use the "canned" cards, then I would recommend Art Explosion. But the average user will likely appreciate the professional, high quality cards in the Hallmark package. Personally, I consider the choice of the Hallmark package over Art Explosion a no brainer. 

A note on versions: The publisher comes out with a new version of the Hallmark program every year (2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, etc.) and the same is true for Art Explosion Greeting Card Factory. Having used many of these versions, I find very little reason to recommend upgrading year by year. Disappointingly, the stock cards in the Hallmark program do not seem to have changed appreciably in many years, and the same is true for Art Explosion.

I had a very old version of Hallmark Studio, don't even remember how old.  Wanted to update.  I installed the program and was absolutely amazed and very happy with this product and features.  Lots of cards to choose from, very very pretty colors. The event planner is great too! The ONLY thing I would change is the ability change font in the planner, and move written info by tabbing.  Otherwise it's a wonderful program.  Highly recommended!!

This program is very easy to use and the projects are beautiful.

Installation is self explanatory. This also goes for the prepararation of cards ect.Detailed instructions apear at each step at the top of the window as the user moves his her mouse-pointer over various portions of the graphics.

 If you are looking for an easy to use program with great results, this is the one to get. With the cost of cards being what it is, this program will pay for itself very quickly. Relatives will like the fact that they are getting greetings which have been personalized. I recommend this  program highly

I'm not a Spider-Man fan.  I love POWERS, THE ULTIMATES, SUPREME POWER, PLANETARY and other stuff by Warren Ellis, Brian Michael Bendis, et.al.  So when I bought this, I wondered if spending a whopping $49 would be worth it.    

I wanted to read Straczynski's recent run of Spider-Man, but if I was going to spend about $20 on a graphic novel, why not spend a little more for the whole thing.  And that's just what you get.  In addition to getting Straczynski's 4-year run (which includes Spider-Man's evolution and discovery of his totemic powers), you get everything leading up to JUNE 2006 (which is just like 3 issues ago!).  And all on 1 DVD-ROM.  

True, the Cons are that when it comes to Crossovers, you only get the Amazing Spider-Man stories and reading it off your computer isn't as fun as reading the actual comics -- but that doesn't compare to getting the entire run.  It's like complaining about getting a free PS3, XBox360 AND Nintendo Wii, because the box didn't come with it or you're missing one controller.  

$50 may seem steep, but if comics cost $3 now, so for the price of like one or two months worth of comics -- or for 2 books, you get everything.  And it's true, you can just print out the pages if you want (so if you want to abuse your office or school's printer, go for it!

This set has got everything.  Almost every major Spider-man moment is in this collection.  From Spider-man's first appearance in Amazing Fantasy #15, his wedding, and not to forget those great super-villain battles with the Green Goblin and Venom.

Each issue is scanned in .pdf format.  It has all the original colors, ads, and fan mail printed.  They are all organized by year and it says they are all printable.  If you are looking for the entire Stan Lee and John Romita Sr.'s run, here it is.  It is great to see where Todd Mcfarlane, the creator of Spawn got his start on old webhead.   J. Michael Strackzynski, the writer of Babylon 5 also takes a crack at Spider-man's life.  

The collection covers the beginning from Amazing Fantasy #15 to Amazing Spiderman #531, which is around the start of Marvel's Civil War.

Instead of spending thousands of dollars on purchasing back issues, you can own this entire collection for around $40-$45.  If you have the ink, you can print out any issue to your heart's desire.

The only drawbacks are around the 80s when several spider-man books begin to crossover.  You only get a part of the story in Kraven's Last Hunt or Maximum Carnage.  One major moment of Spider-man's life is left out, where he fights Harry Osborn as Green Goblin. The conclusion of that story took place in The Spectacular Spider-man title.  That problem is going to fixed in the future as GIT Corp. has plans to release a complementary collection  dvd that includes The Spectacular Spider-man, Web of Spiderman, and Peter Parker:  Spider-man.  They say on the boards that it will be out by fall of next year, but you never know with this company.  I waited about six months for this dvd after it was delayed from its original release date from march.

Now that I have it, I cannot wait to dig into the mythos of the old webhead.  I recommend this to anyone who loves comics and loves Spider-man.

Be sure to look out for the Ultimate Spider-man collection and there are a few others like the Hulk, Daredevil, Iron Man, and Captain America collections that are due out next year

I am teaching myself Japanese. I want to learn more languages. I learned German, French, and Korean. I want to learn Korean. Because I have a friend who speaks Korean. This software is very awesome!!! This can really help students who are taking French or Spanish to get a good review. 

If you find a language you want to learn from this software... good luck with your studies and have fun

My dad got this for me to supplement a Latin textbook I have been studying for my high school language course. It is quick and easily understandable. You get plenty of words and phrases, which is perfect for a traveler. If you want to learn the language for the sake of knowing it, not travel, however, you'd better get a book to supplement this. It doesn't teach about pluralization, verb conjugation, or other oddities that the language holds, such as, in Latin, the ending -m which implies a direct object. The Latin CD also does not use the dashes over the vowels, which may or may not be necessary, I don't know. Overall, I am very happy with the product and with the price of $39.99 (USD), but I am also quite glad I have my textbook (ECCE ROMANI) to go with it

This is a great item for any collector or new fans to the X-men. All the older along with the newer issues look great. The CD includes all issues of the Uncanny X-men (1-461) along with Giant Sized and annual issues. There is also comprehensive biographies on the more popular characters and artwork and layouts of the Xaiver Institute. Could it of had more content, maybe, but this will keep one busy for a long time. With easy maneuverabiltity, this is a highly addictive CD with virtually months of entertainment

Nice collection of the complete issues, though, of course, one knows going in that the later Marvel practice of storylines that run through all the books makes the stories provided only a small slice of the full story, which is somewhat frustrating.  

And the earliest years are, of course, somewhat crude (heretically, even the Kirby artwork in the first year is).

But very nice to have in an affordable edition, regardless of the flaws (though best viewed with a large monitor

I loved the X-Men cartoon in the 90s and Fox, and always liked reading the graphic novels in Barnes and Noble and the like.  However, I just never had the time or money to get into it like I wanted.  This collection is a great way for us beginnings to understand the depth of the mythology and see the transformation of the series over the years.  Reading the first 60 issues was a trip -- seeing how the characters were developed, both the art and their literary personality.  

If you're interested in the X-Men, whether from the new movies or just from being a kid at heart -- for 40 bucks you can know it all. (almost)

While I love the content and the overall idea, it seems they seriously skimped on the packaging. All you get, outside of the outer box, is a cd in a paper envelope. No jewel case, book, insert, etc.......perhaps it's on the cd

don't get me started on that latter program, argh
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
Nobody, and I mean NObody, could be more of an Illustrator novice & ignoramus than I.  Several months ago I was given a licensed copy of Illustrator 9 that a departing coworker had used.  Wanting a chance to design the departmental logo that otherwise would've gone to an agency, I raised my figurative hand and volunteered for duty.  Having taught myself everything from MS-DOS to TurboCAD, to Photoshop Elements, not to mention Word, Excel, and Powerpoint (don't get me started on that latter program, argh), I figured I could tackle at least the basics of Illustrator 9.  Loaded it on my laptop, took it home for a weekend....and just about lost my sanity -- and several fingernails -- trying to learn that confounding program.  I managed to produce a few logos, one of which was chosen.  But egads, what a big, stinky bear Illustrator 9 was to wrestle.

When I saw that CS2 had this Live Trace feature, I pleaded with my workplace Santa to get it for me, and WOW!  What an overall improvement!!

Illustrator will still not be as intuitive to pick up as an MS Office product, but this comes darn close.  With CS2, they've given us "hot tips" -- little clues about what some of the tools do, that pop up when you mouse over the tool.  The intuitive menus are nice too.  Also cool is that all the text & paragraph and fill & stroke features, which used to be huge boxes taking up valuable real estate on the screen, are now condensed up on a small horizontal toolbar, like in the Office products ... and when you mouse over them, the screen tips tell you how to expand them.  Aaaahh!  Finally some help for dunces like me.

Live Trace and Live Paint are unbelieveably cool.  The very first thing I did after loading CS2 was to grab a .jpg photo of a soccer ball off Google Images, and within 20 minutes, without consulting any book or online Help, I'd converted it into a simple graphic image painted into the 2 colors I wanted.

But as for a great guidebook, the reviewer who suggested Illustrator Visual Quickstart guide by Elaine Weinmann was dead-on.  I've bought several other "highly rated" books to try to help me through the quagmire of Adobe products, so I've seen them all.  The Visual Quickstart book doesn't have any of that insufferable "wanna-be-a-comic-novel-author" writing, and focuses just on the basics.  And it's very literal, with step-by-step instructions.  Still there's no substitute for the utterly excruciating process of learning Illustrator through experience.  But the Weinmann book's better than any I've seen yet.

The only reason I haven't given this product a 5 is because it still doesn't have the intuitiveness that it needs.  In that way it's still "snobby" -- aimed at pros, not folks like me who need to do occasional stuff but not for a living.  But this is a far, far, far cry better than Illustrator 9.  Absolutely worth the money, just for Live Trace and Live Paint alone

Not bad, however, in Version 10, was able to use CNTRL + to zoom in.  Used the + on the number pad -- now this function doesn't work, and the only + that works is that in the top row of the keyboard.  The zoom out "-" in the number pad still works, but not the plus.  I say that's not good.

Why ruin things with an upgrade

OK, sorry, I've been vectoring line art since 1990. My current machine is an AMD Athlon XP with the 333 FSB, 1 Gig ram & 80 Gig HD shared on network & a 40 Gig HD for software, OS is XPpro, it's 2 years old I think. I installed three cathode ray tubes, you know; big boxy monitors, the largest of which is a 21 inch monster right in my face all day. I read the reviews here and started "Quaking" in my boots! Oops I said to myself, and I looked up my previous day's purchases for the new Artist I just hired. Sure enough; I bought CS2 for the new machine. So I downloaded the 30 day trial for Illustrator CS2 Upyours, I mean Upgrade. Replacing my old Illustrator 8.01 These kids I've been interviewing made me think I should take a look outside MY CAVE! So I got it loaded up and sure enough; it takes longer to load than my old corrupted rusty buddy; Illustrator 8.01, about twice as long. ( so leave it running )

!!!!!!!!! BUT WOW !!!!!!!

I should have done this sooner, or should I have ?
As soon as It was running Illustrator CS2 AUTO UPDATED ITSELF.
It wanted it's Adobe Bridge fixed up. So I let it. This is just exactly what people have been complaining about.

******** THE BRIDGE IS FIXED *********

WAY SUPER COOL DUDE! I keep the Bridge open on the right monitor and I can drag art into Illustrator CS2 at lightning speed. The whole time I get to see super big previews of all the artwork I need to work with. Way better than XPpro's little thumbnails.

LIVE TRACE: Realy nice, I think this is what these companies are using to sell Vectored Line Art to Printers like me. It is very accurate and seems to acomodate all those nasty giant pixels that up till now, took a human brain to see past while vectoring. OK, it's not as good as a skilled craftsman such as (full of) myself, but for only about $160 or so, it's like a gift from ALMIGHTY GOD!

No crashes, no bugs, just pure inteligence from Adobe once again.
Don't you think of a little white mud hut in the dessert when you say ADOBE?

I really apreciate the Object Oriented work bar thing at the top, wait, let me go look at what it's called, Hmmmm, still don't know, well it changes according to what kind of object you've clicked on in your artwork. Also this new wonder of technology solves an old problem of global color change needed for color separation work. That top task bar object oriented do-hickey is similar but better than the one in Photoshop.

Transparent objects, looks like everything can be transparent, WOW, do you know what that means ??? I gotta go use it some more, it's just way to cool. OK, I'm back, EVEN FONTS can be transparent, .tiffs .jpgs, everything. THIS MEANS way less jumping back and forth from Photoshop to Illustrator.

But I do believe you have to be very capable with your hardware, operating system, and have at least a year; full time with Illustrator and Photoshop to fully appreciate the thought and creative potential that Adobe has opened up for us

Maybe I'm just not pro enough to realize the ways to put some more precise reports together, but that is the only snag in this otherwise capable product.

To accomplish the reports that I need, I am able to edit the Gantt chart view sufficiently to satisfy my purpose.  So, it gets the report done, just not as nicely as I had hoped.

Tracking work is made incredibly simple.  Rest assured you can manage a hefty project with this little piece of software

I decided to get this office suite after using it recently. I've usually worked on Office 97 and 2000, but the 2003 version has some pretty cool features not found in the older versions. The feature that I really enjoy is the Pivot Report feature in MS Access, which wasn't in MS Access 2000. This is a truly great reporting feature. You can now use Access as a front-end to slice and dice data stored on data warehouses in Oracle, SQL Server, Sybase and other enterprise-type databases. If you're used to creating crosstab reports, you'll definitely like the Pivot Report feature. Crosstabs are limited to 2 dimensions but there's no limitation on the number of dimensions in Pivot Report.

To me, the main drawback is the price. (I did get mine at around $370 at J&R, which is a great price.) I figure I can upgrade this in about 5 years time, which works out to about $70 to $75 per year (assuming that I'll be paying about $370 to upgrade in 5 years time.)

A big positive is that this is the industry standard. So the work you put into learning the multiple new features of Word, Excel, MS Access is not wasted because you can reuse the same skills in another job. Your time will be well spent. Note that the software may seem bloated but the intelligent user is able to choose and pick the most useful and relevant features of each application and ignore the features that are not useful. Different features are useful to different people...

Another positive: Each product in Office Professional is fully programmable using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) which you can use to build custom programs. This very powerful feature is sometimes overlooked when shopping for Office suites.

You can read it BEFORE buying the product by looking on the ZA site. I'm going to make this hard and make you google it. 
I'm not going to criticize anyone except to say IF you have a question or problem, the ZA website lists pdf file user manuals for all of the company's products. There are some compatibility probs for example with Yahoo Mail BETA. As soon as Yahoo finalizes it's mail server ZA will be compatible. Simply switch back to yahoo mail (pre beta). There are several other beta products but generally if you're having problems they can be easily fixed by adjusting the settings just like all security programs. ZA REALLY is better at what it is suppose to do than other products ONCE you have learned how to use it. Kinda like most things in the world of things that are unfamiliar. 
I use the free stuff too, and recommend them for those who are on a budget - students, etc. but the ZA suite is worth the money and is more effective for those who can't afford to get mugged or pickpocketed on the info hiway. I know what you're thinking btw...but ask yourself "Is your private information, time  and computer worth it to you?" If so go with Zone Alarm, learn how to use it and be safer on the net.

As you can see by other reviews above, the Studio series has a history of being buggy.  You also hear a lot of people saying "This package is so much more intuitive and easy to use than the other 'powerful enough to be worth owning' packages -- if only it were more stable!"  

I am one of those long-suffering users (5 years, going back to Version 9), and finally with Version 10.6 I have stopped complaining -- it now works as I'd hoped when I bought it.  The $300 I spent on other packages trying to do better was wasted -- I kept getting frustrated with interfaces that a 500-page manual couldn't clarify.  And I'm a very sophisticated computer user by most measures.

I am turning all of our old family video tapes and CD's into DVD's.  I use Studio for all the editing (have not tried the DVD recording -- just use Roxio for that) and am now very pleased.  If you own 10.5 then version 10.6 is a free download.

One important piece of advice that would have saved me lots of problems: put every "project" you work on in a separate subdirectory.  If you have 5 soccer game videos make a /game1, /game2 etc. series of subfolders.  If you edit those to a "Jimmy's great plays" proect, put it in a separate /JimmyPlays folder.  When projects are in the same folder and you edit them a few times weird overwrite problems can happen in 10.5.  I learned this trick before 10.6 came out, and I don't know if it matters any more but I take no chances.

Why did I stick with something where I admit that version 9.0 was "powerful but unstable" and 10.0 was "more powerful and more unstable"?  Because I can actually use Studio with minimal reference to instructions, and when I use it things turn out as I expect.  Now that it has become stable and reliable I am a VERY satisfied customer.

So that's how I got from being a frustrated Studio customer to giving it 4 stars on this review.  I tell the whole story so you understand that the other reviews from frustrated people are relevant for the older versions, but that "10.5 updated for free to 10.6" really is the best choice out there now... as my unused expensive rivals to Studio on my shelf prove.  Just keep putting every project inn its own folder!

I've been using Studio for years and while I definitely had reliability problems with Studio 10.0, 10.6 has been very reliable, and beta testing 10.7 shows me it is just getting better.  I tried Premiere Elements but it was much harder to figure out how to do things, and it was much slower burning a simple DVD image, and it simply doesn't do HD which I've started playing with.  I'm sticking with Studio and I make a DVD just about every week with my kids' videos.  I do recommend that you have a good system that is fairly clean

I have had nothing short of an excellent experience with this product. I have created numerous videos of my children's escapades and sporting events. I do have one warning however. Provide the grandparents with a box of tissues because they never fail to cry when they see their little angels parading across the widescreen. The software is extremely intuitive and easy to use. My wildest expectations were exceeded.

This program is positively wonderful for word practice and pronunciation with a number of flash-card style game and  a very elegant listen-record-replay interface. While the two characters do pronounce words slightly differently, hearing those variations really helps to understand the phonetics in a way that a single voice would lack.

However, this really is more of a companion tool for a more traditional course. I purchased this with "Colloquial Icelandic" and would definitely recommend purchasing them together. There are some extremely strange spelling/pronunciation variations and without having a written explanation of these things, you may be left staring in great confusion as the characters read phrases on screen -- "Hva" is pronounced "kwah?" WHAT? Having "Colluquial Icelandic" to turn to for explanation helped a great deal. That package has two audio CDs of alphabet, number, vocabulary and conversation exercises with a very well-written 370 page coursebook.

I gave this product a 5-star rating as it is superb for its intended purpose, but it does not stand alone as a complete course

I bought Version 5 of this software a few years ago and was very pleased with the many features.  A tech at my Isp (BellSouth) recommended this software to me. I recently purchased version 6 for my new laptop which is running Windows Xp Pro.  Installation was a snap.  Updates are frequent and install quickly with my Dsl connection.  The software suite has in my opinion more and better features than Norton Pro which I use on my desktop.  I really like the Registry cleaner (fixer) and the defrag tools.  (They use Trend Micro for virus protection) The program allows simple maintenance or for more experienced users indepth tools that allow you to maintain and tweak your system. There is a lot of extra programs that come with this software that I did not install after reading some reviews and warnings about using them.  However, my personal experience after installing just the System Suit 6 Professional has really been good for me. I bought my copy from Walmart and filled out the rebate following the instructions carefully and I received my rebate after about 6 weeks.  I hope if anyone buys this software because of my recommendation will have similar results.  I would rate my knowledge of computers as above average, which may be why I did not have any problems with the software.

I just upgraded my Webster software to this version for WinXP.  It's ok and does the job it's intended to perform. But I liked the previous versions that displayed both the definitions and the thesaurus in parallel panels. Just a matter of display preference, so it's not that important to every user.

i have a question about this.  I'm wondering if i can hook my guitar into my computer and record it and then like add drums and loops an stuff onto it.  Is that possible on this program?  Cause my friend has Acid Pro 4.0 and that is really awesome but it's like $400 and i dont have that kinda money.  Wut i liked about Acid  Pro 4.0 is that you could hook up ur guitar to the computer and stuff like that, so im wondering if you can do that on this program.  If u have an answer for me, e-mail me at PeepilotT@aol.com .

I discovered this software by accident, while window shopping, and I ended up buying it and taking it home.  I was able to get it up and running pretty quickly, and was creating my own music right out of the box.  Of course it takes some time, but this program makes it possible to make some pretty good music in your spare time.  Add a mic to your computer,and you can pretty much turn your computer into a recording/editing studio, make your own music and burn it to CD.  Sounic Foundry also makes it easy to publish your work to the web, by providing an online community of Acid music-makers who review and comment on one anothers' work.  You can also listen to music published by other users.  Even if you're just a musical legend in your own living room, this makes it easy and fun to become just that.  Sound Forge also sells music loops on CD especially for Acid, but you can find lots of free loops on the web that also work.  Sound Forge also provides weekly samples for free on their Acid Planet website

I am a veteran screen printer and am kind of new to the graphic arts side.  This purchase has paid for itself over and over now that I don't have to run to someone else for art.  It was rumored that it is hard to find what is needed as there is no computer search for images...  I guess some people are too lazy to familiarize themselves with the book of images...  I did and I LOVE this product!!!!

Good for those looking for a vector collection.  Not so good for those looking for photo clip art, as photos are "high-res" at 200 DPI.  I suppose the photos are useful to an extent, but the usefulness is limited by size.  I was looking for vector art, so I am satisfied

  My experience with this software as well as the company has been extremely positive. I ordered this program a little over a month ago. When I first received it from Amazon, I was amazed at the shear size of the program. It has a HUGE 1,300 page book with all the images and categories for easy reference. It also comes with 34 CDs that are loaded with images. This software is truly the largest set of art I have ever seen!
  Dealing with Nova Development is as easy to use as their software! When I first opened the box I was a little overwhelmed with the whole thing, so I called tech support. I may have waited a whole 20 seconds before I began speaking with a technician. They walked me through the install and how to use the clip art. They were professional and courteous.
  This software gets an A+ in my book!.

I've been looking at buying this collection for some time now and I finally broke down and bought it.  Very pleased with everything included.  LOTS of stuff to use, and not just cheezy clip art - lots of boarders, symbols, brush strokes, etc.  The bundle that i bought contained 1 wrong disc (disc 3 was actually disc 30) - one phone call and a new one was sent to my house no questions asked.

I run the after school program at the local JR high where i work. We try to push the importance of computer skills on the children. I just upgraded to the 800,000 clip art library. We use these images for just about every project. I have never wanted a certain type of image and not been able to find it!!!

Homesite is widely recognized as "the" premier tool for coding HTML, client side, and server side code by hand. Adding it to your resume won't land you a job, but it will certainly boost your chances of getting an interview because it indicates that you are not a cheap, WYSIWYG junkie.

One of the things I like best about Homesite 5 is the adaptability it allows when coding in ASP.NET. I was able to find a plug-in, which when added to Homesite, recognized the .NET tags and colors them accordingly. There are similar plug-ins for just about every language out there.

If you are unfamiliar with HomeSite, are considering a purchase, but are not sure it's the right tool for you, here's a very brief description on how it works: This is not a drag-and-drop design tool that created the code for you. It is, in essence, a text editor on steroids. As you code BY HAND it will color the code for you, tell you when you've made errors, offer you a ton of help on knowing what tags mean, has a built in FTP client, helps you organize your work into projects, and a bunch of other functions I've never used.

Here's the main thing you need to know: If you're a HomeSite pro, then you are also a REAL developer.

To everyone who has whined about lack of support: What do you expect for less then $100? If you purchase a flagship product from Macromedia such as Dreamweaver, Studio MX, or Fireworks, you'll get all the support you'll need.

Also, I've been able to find PLENTY of FREE support from news groups and email lists that focus on web development. For every problem or question I've found someone who knows the solution. You can too!!!

Just a note: Amazon is behind the times. From the Macromedia website you can now purchase two versions ahead of what Amazon is offering.

Well worth the $99.00

...and I knew it wouldn't be the last. Very very fun. Don't think Nancy Drew is just for girls, guys can play and love the game as well. I am living proof of that.

The game itself really isn't that hard, it is just some of the puzzles can be very tricky (I don't like puzzles) and that is the only 'beef' I have with the game, and most mystery games. 

Now, back to the game itself.. intriguing storyline, suspicous characters and they all got something to hide. Search for clues while interrogating suspects.. explore the resort, run errands, break into locked rooms without getting caught, disable alarms, and SNOOP.. and that is just the tip of the iceburg.

If  you like mystery games, Nancy Drew is for you! Her games aren't overly hard, and they are very fun. Even if you aren't a mystery fan, try it! You'll love it. Try them all! You will become a Nancy Drew fan, trust me.. I did

This was a wonderful game!  Hours of good, solid game play.  An interesting mystery and intriguing characters.  A chance to interact with aquatic life.  I learned how to work a GPS and a HAM radio.  It was so much fun.  The puzzles were a good mix of ability-levels and types.  Word puzzles, spatial puzzles, problem-solving ones.  I can completely recommend this game

I am very happy with it but it doesn't live up to my expectations.
I also have the reg. Plus for XP and I really don't think the extra money is worth it.  If I were to do over I would still have bought the Plus superpack for XP but not the regular Plus just because I do have a Media Center PC. If I didn't have that the regular Plus for XP would have been just fine

Not a complicated application, but it successfully repartitioned a 100G drive into 3rds on a new Lenovo laptop with XP SP2.  I would recommend using the DOS version which you can get just by booting on the CD.  Requires no install, you can simply boot, make the changes, and it is done.  Seems to be very straightforward and I would just be inherently nervous about repartitioning the boot drive with Windows running

I installed a WD 320G usb drive to use as a backup drive. I used the HD backup software to do auto backups. Unfortunatly the software took controll of the entire drive and I could not use it as you would a normal drive (Drag n drop)or access a particular file.   I used Partition Magic to reclaim my USB drive and in the process I partitioned the drive. The drive now works as I want it to I have control!

Partition Magic was very easy to use and didi a perfect job.

I am amazed what this program can do. It is a big difference from PS 5.5. It is a new learning curve but well worth it. What used to take me hours to do is now an action and done in 2 minutes. Amazon had the best price for me from a source I trust ordering from. It is worth it

Photoshop is incredibly awesome!!!  And in reality most professionals already know that fact and have no need to read further about the program, it is a must have for them. However the learning curve here is extremely steep.  This program is designed for people that use it in their jobs daily to produce images for sale.  There are less inexpensive and easier to use programs out there for people looking to edit images for personal use including Photoshop elements.

I won't include my website URL here, but I'm a professional photographer, who displays and sells his work at juried exhibitions. I've been using Photoshop since version 5.0, roughly 6-7 years.

Frankly, I'm surprised to see how many negative reviews there are here of Photoshop CS2, and that overall the product only gets three stars. I understand all the frustration, though. Even on a top-of-the-line machine, "PS CS2" can be slow at times. However, in my case, that's because I'm working on incredibly large files. 

For example, my camera / scanner combination typically produces 50 megapixel images. By the time multiple layers are added in PS, one image file can be 500 MB - 1 GB in size. This is exactly why I have a dual-Opteron system with 4 GB of RAM: so I can work on these monster files in Photoshop!

For me, Photoshop is a must-have. There are *no* alternative programs for me to consider that can handle my files and do what I want to get done. I don't even want to mention all the advanced features that I use on a daily basis, frankly because that's part of my edge as a professional. I've spent over five years working in PS everyday, and have carefully studied several advanced books on PS. The learning curve is long, but the rewards are great if you have high goals and high standards.

Yeah, Adobe's got some major improvements to make, along the lines that other reviewers have mentioned. For me, the only real problem is poor and often wasteful use of system memory. And I would agree with other reviewers here that for most people, the full Photoshop CS2 is probably a waste of money. Photoshop Elements is probably a better way to go, though I haven't used it personally. I know a good web designer who uses Paint Shop Pro, and who seems to be happy.

IMHO, some people are probably drawn to Photoshop the way others are drawn to AutoCad or Solidworks or 3D Studio Max. All these programs are incredibly powerful tools that can support an entire career if one puts in the time and effort to become a true expert user. You can't make a career out of PS Elements, or Paint Shop Pro, or GIMP, or whatever else other reviewers may mention. PS CS2 is "the standard" for image manipulation

Adobe Photoshop has a long history of being the best software in the business.  It's only downside is that it may seem a bit daunting to the beginning user.  There is, however, a plethora of texts, tutorials, learning guides, and even video's to help abate the learning curve

I have Fireworks, Corel Paint, and now CS2 to choose from. Perhaps it's my familiarity with PhotoShop that makes me so partial to it, but I feel it's the best imagery software on the market. I upgraded to this from PS7, so I missed out on CS, but from what I can tell, this is the smoothest-running version yet. I've not encountered any problems with system or support... I guess everyone's experience is different. But this is great software, and the Vanishing Point feature is just brilliant

The new Adobe Acrobat has a cleaner look and feel, and is more user-friendly.  I especially apreciate the new quick distiller buttons in any Microsoft application, which allow you to create a PDF in one click rather than having to go to File and Print. Some functionality as before, with some new organization and better look/feel

I love this Adobe product.  It works very well for me - only a couple of minor glitches - it keeps asking me to re-register - but that's only a minor annoyance.  Overall it is a very good product

Even if one could afford the full PhotoShop CS or CS2, Elements has it all for the photo enthusiast.  Elements has an uncluttered interface with two choices for photo manipulation;
Quick Fix and Standard Edit. The Browser is adequate though I've used simpler ones for organizing and finding photos. Many of the features of the full program can be found in Elements like Layers, plug-ins for effects, and a variety of adjustmens.  With a little patience and experimenting, as well as magazines that include video tutorials for specific needs you'll be surprised how creative you can be. This program does not have the learning curve of the full PhotoShop software yet is more than powerful enough for the creative amateur photographer

This program is fantastic. It's super easy to use and has a calendar that will notify you of upcoming events/holidays/etc. There are loads of pre-made cards to choose from or you can edit them to your needs. You can also make your own card without any help. The same thing for envelopes! 

There are also quite a few additional projects included. You can create your own stationary sets (paper and envelopes), awards and certificates, kid's activity pages and more.

I highly recommend this program if you're a beginner card maker. I mostly bought this (I was a beginner) to save money on cards and in the 2 months I've had this program, it has more than paid for itself. It's much more convenient than going to the store, WAY cheaper and I really like being able to make matching envelopes.

I was really surprised to read some of the other reviews about this product -- it's as we we've purchased entirely different programs. In my experience with this software, I've found it to be extremely smooth-running and user-friendly from installation to printing, and the card selection and customization is second to none. 

There have been perfect cards for every occasion to date and we've customized them countless ways -- adding and editing photos, moving text, sending ecards, you name it! Navigating within the art studio is very intuitive.

Printing cards from the sofware is very easy and the on-screen configuration works great. Unlike some of the other reviews, I haven't had the problem of having to re-configure every time I print. We set it up once and that was it. I've printed on card stock paper, which turns out gorgeous, and we've also printed the quarter-fold plain letter size which also looks great and works perfect with size A2 envelopes (this is a great printing option if you don't want to buy card stock paper!).

I've used this software on all of my computers, have recommended it to many people, and so far have not yet encountered or heard of any problems. I highly recommend it. It's a fun program, the recipients will love their customized cards, and it will save you money in the long run

I bought this package because my daughter needed to be able to do word processing and make presentations for school.  I used it because its what is being used at my office.  I wish they had included Frontpage instead of One Note (which I really haven't been able to find a use for).  Otherwise, it works the same as other MS Office packages I've used in the past

I followed all instructions before I attempted to do an upgrade from Windows Me to Windows XP - infact, the more I read the more I was told to do a clean upgrade.  So, I did a backup and removed programs that were not compatible and I got some instructions off the internet on how to do it and it went very smooth. I love what it gave me. Clean upgrade means a clean start - you remove everything and start with a new program

I have been using Microsoft Operating Systems for a very long time, and, i still say that this is the best System out there, for many reasons.

An increasing amount of Linux and Mac users have made the claim that they are more compatible with programs, and are less vulnerable to virus and hacks.

In Response to Linux Users-
Stay away from Linux, Linux is free for a reason. It is compatible with very very few programs as it is, and that number will only decrease. For Gamers - Rarley do i see a Linux compatible game. Just stay away from this system.

For Mac Users-
Mac's also have a lesser amount of compatible programs. Fewer and Fewer programs can run on them, and like linux, that number will only decrease. The only thing keeping Macintosh alive is Itunes. Which is compatible with Windows. Besides, When Direct X 10 Comes out, it will only be available for Windows, making Macintosh's un-usable for new games when the next windows OS comes out (Microsoft Vista). The computers are also generally more expensive than Windows.  Btw - You can get viruses on Mac's

I have been running XP for a few days and so far so good. I was running win98se and decided to upgrade after microsoft announced that they no longer support win98. My software is now obsolete? Yikes! Well, I'm glad I upgraded.

Installation went smooth as silk and I have not experienced any problems at all. I had to find a couple of new drivers for hardware but that's been it. And for Home Edition versus Pro, I think I can be quite happy with the Home Edition.

I will say that win98se had been a headache for a long time so the stability that I see so far with XP Home is a relief.

Good features, good reliability. A very decent upgrade. I recommend it. Four stars

Honestly, I don't know how much more they can improve Adobe Acrobat.  It is an excellent product, and a god-send for electronic file management.

I upgraded from version 6.0.  The only problem I had with 6.0 is that it seemed terribly slow.

This new version seems much brisker.  It loads quickly, and files seem to "print" to it much more quickly than version 6.0.  I do not utilize the "one-button" feature it provides in MS Office and other programs.  I try to keep all my programs as non-integrated as possible, because my previous experiences showed that they really, really bog each other down, no matter how much their makers claim they won't.

I don't come close to using all the features of Acrobat, but for my needs, it far surpasses anything else I've tried (or researched).

If you're having problems with version 6.0, or have an older version that you just want upgraded, I strongly recommend this.  However, I don't foresee ever needing to upgrade Acrobat again

I have been using v.7 from the last week or so and i am very pleased with it. It loads very fast (unlike all other adobe versions), the conversion to PDF from doc or ppt files also is much quicker. 

I have not encountered any problems yet, but its only been 7 days since i am using it..

Definitely worth the upgrade

Version 6 seemed to go off the track by changing many users' favorite features, like form ordering along with how unattractive bookmarks had become. More than anything, version 7 increases one's ability to collaborate securely, providing complete control over your document, who can open, print, or even comment on it. But version 7 is more of a fix than a major upgrade, as it cures many of the ills of the previous version. Best of all, Adobe has kept the price the same. Very nice

First, if you're thinking about using these photos for print, you may wish to think again.  Most objects run between 300-600 pixels in width or height, or 1-2 inches at 300 DPI.  Stretch them bigger than that, and they'll start to blur and/or get jagged.

Also note, that if you try to export/save an image from the Hemera Image browser and select the 300 DPI setting, the browser may stretch the graphic larger than it's actual size, causing blurring and jaggedness right out of the gate.

You need to use the "Use Image's Full Size" checkbox when exporting images.  If you specify a 300 DPI size, and don't use that checkbox, you'll get a stretched image.  

For example, the first image in the collection (the pocket watch) is only 384 pixels wide. If you specify 300 DPI and don't check the "Use Image's Full Size" box, the software will stretch it to 642 pixels wide.  The stretching will cause the image to look fuzzier and/or more jagged when you use it in a web site or print project.

All that said, if you're going to use the images for the web, they're great.

You get almost all the images you'd find in their three "Photo Objects" collections, each of which is much more expensive than this single collection.  The difference is the Photo Objects collections offer about 20-30% higher resolution (i.e. the first image in the collection is 384 pixels wide, but is 492 pixels wide in Photo Objects) and you can save the Photo Objects images with transparent backgrounds (while this collection forces you to specify a color for the background).

For the price, this is a good collection.  There are lots of shots with minor variations, so it may seem like duplication, but for someone trying to get something just right, that slightly different tilt of the head may be just what the doctor ordered

OneCare is not a tweaker's friend. It has no knobs and gizmos for power users to tinker with. However, it does one thing right. It works. When you use it, you truly do have one care. Do what it tells you to make it green. If you can do that, your computer is safe from viruses, hackers, malware, spyware, known security vulnerabilities, low disk space, slow disk access, and data that is not backed up.
OneCare takes a layered approach to keep you and your data safe. It has an inbound firewall to keep bad stuff out of your computer. If bad stuff gets through the firewall, it has antivirus to stop it from affecting your system and an outbound firewall to keep it from spreading. If that doesn't stop the bad stuff, it makes sure you have a backup of your data on a separate drive or on CDs.
In the past, I haven't bought security products. There are plenty of free ones on the market that do a satisfactory job. However, ever since I tried OneCare as a beta tester, I fell in love with it. It is simple to use.
Reduce your worries about being online down to OneCare and try it today. You can even install it on other computers to help keep friends and family protected

I was afraid at first not to order directly from Adobe but decided to take the cheaper route. It was obviously worth it - everything arrived perfectly - wrapped up, original CD set, etc.
Shipped in record time as well.

don't get me started on that latter program, argh
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
Nobody, and I mean NObody, could be more of an Illustrator novice & ignoramus than I. Several months ago I was given a licensed copy of Illustrator 9 that a departing coworker had used. Wanting a chance to design the departmental logo that otherwise would've gone to an agency, I raised my figurative hand and volunteered blindly for duty. Having taught myself everything from MS-DOS to TurboCAD, to Photoshop Elements, not to mention Word, Excel, and Powerpoint (don't get me started on that latter program, argh), I figured I could tackle at least the basics of Illustrator 9. Loaded it on my laptop, took it home for a weekend....and just about lost my sanity -- and several fingernails -- trying to learn that confounding program. I managed to produce a few logos, one of which was chosen. But egads, what a big, stinky bear Illustrator 9 was to wrestle. 

When I saw that CS2 had this Live Trace feature, I pleaded with my workplace Santa to get it for me, and WOW! What an overall improvement!! 

Illustrator will still not be as intuitive to pick up as an MS Office product, but this comes darn close. With CS2, they've given us "hot tips" -- little clues about what some of the tools do, that pop up when you mouse over the tool. The intuitive menus are nice too. Also cool is that all the text & paragraph and fill & stroke features, which used to be huge boxes taking up valuable real estate on the screen, are now condensed up on a small horizontal toolbar, like in the Office products ... and when you mouse over them, the screen tips tell you how to expand them. Aaaahh! Finally some help for dunces like me. 

Live Trace and Live Paint are unbelieveably cool. The very first thing I did after loading CS2 was to grab a .jpg photo of a soccer ball off Google Images, and within 20 minutes, without consulting any book or online Help, I'd converted it into a simple graphic image painted into the 2 colors I wanted. 

But as for a great guidebook, the reviewer who suggested Illustrator Visual Quickstart guide by Elaine Weinmann was dead-on. I've bought several other "highly rated" books to try to help me through the confounding quagmire of Adobe products, so I've seen them all. The Visual Quickstart book doesn't have any of that insufferable "wanna-be-a-comic-novel-author" writing, and focuses just on the basics. And it's very literal, with step-by-step instructions. Still there's no substitute for the utterly excruciating process of learning Illustrator through experience. But the Weinmann book's better than any I've seen yet. 

The only reason I haven't given this product a 5 is because it still doesn't have the intuitiveness that it needs. In that way it's still "snobby" -- aimed at pros, not folks like me who need to do occasional design stuff but not for a living. But this is a far, far, far cry better than Illustrator 9. Absolutely worth the money, just for Live Trace and Live Paint alone.

I feel Home Designer Suite 6 is a good value for the price. It obviously is not a full blown pro program, which I think many people expect, however it is a great tool for an ordinary person to do preliminary plans for new construction or remodeling. Those plans can then be provided to a architect or builder as a foundation for final planning. It is quite easy to learn the basics by merely following the tutorials in the manual, or on the provided CD

This is a good software for casual use (hiking, biking, geocaching), but not without issues. On the positive side, it definitely beats all non-digital (scanned USGS maps) alternatives. The level of details is good enough(how many of us need to know topography down to 5 feet?). The fact that maps are digitally generated (with vectors I believe) makes all the labels clear at any scale. It has two advantages over its main "digital" competitor, NG Topo. First, all of the US is on one DVD for the price of separate state/region CDs from NG. And second, it is available. I could not even find NG's Northeast edition anywhere on the web! One might think NH and ME are some obscure corners of the globe and not big tourist destinations.

Now the few negatives. The Exchange feature with GPS is flaky. Sometimes it takes several tries of unplugging and replugging the cable and restarting the program before it recognizes my Garmin. Part of it could be that low and mid range GPS still have serial connection and are not truly plug-and-play even with COM-to-USB adapter (beats me why Garmin can't make all their GPS with USB in this day and age). In any case, regardless of whose  fault it is, it is annoying at times not to be able to connect the two smoothly.

The second problem I noticed was with the 3-D window. It clearly consumes a lot of memory and crashes my laptop if I do a lot of rapid rescaling. I ended up just closing that window, since it is pretty much for "coolness" and does not add any real topographical value.

Finally, I had a problem with Delorme's service. I purchased it from Amazon with a rebate offer. However, a month after submitting the necessary info I received a card from Delorme stating that the bar code I sent was not a UPC code. The box only had one bar code on it so I am not sure how I could have made a mistake. They requested that I send a correct one, but with the code cut out and gone, how do they expect me to come up with one?! I feel a little bit like that was a cheap way out of paying the rebate but $20 is not worth the time arguing with them over it. I would be interested to hear if anyone else experienced the same problem.

There are complaints about Win XP SP2 being too expensive or complaints about technical problems.

It is too expensive, but it is the standard at so many companies, big and small, around the world.

I just wanted to say that anyone who gives Windows XP SP2 a one star rating really doesn't understand much about the Windows operating system, and therefore you should not take into consideration their uneducated opinion about operating systems in general.

The price is a bit high, but Windows is what it is...  a dominant operating system

I didn't encounter any problems with this product infact it was much easier to use and it allows you to combine and orginaze text files, chart spreadsheets, drawings, PDF documents and more into a single compressed package with advanced security features it also has many tools, overall this product was fantastic and I cannot recommend this highly enough. The interface and toolbars might be annoying but that is just a slight problem since it can be taken down and become more user friendly. The other reviewers who complained about this being slower need to know that this is just the standard edition which I use, there is a better edition which is The Professional Full Product of Adobe Acrobat 7.0 that also includes an upgrade.....

I have been using Adobe Acrobat for a few years now.  I've used both their Professional and Standard versions.  Now, Adobe has released Acrobat 7.  In this review, I will be discussing primarily the features of the Standard edition.  However, these features are also available in the Professional edition.  Outside of the fact that the Professional version has more workgroup-oriented and enterprise features, these programs are the basically same.  I have noted any features available only in Professional in this review.  

First, what is PDF and what can it do for me?
Adobe's PDF is now a universal format that allows you to preserve the look and integrity of your original documents - Adobe PDF files look exactly like the original pages and fulfill requirements for electronic filing and document security.

Not only that, but you can share the files with anyone, whether on a PC or a Mac.  Each PDF file has the graphics and fonts imbedded into the file.  The user of  the file does not have to have the same font set, nor even purchase Adobe Acrobat, because the Reader version of Acrobat is free!

New Features in Acrobat 7
*	Turn MS Outlook email into searchable documents.  This is a great feature.  It allows you to effortlessly turn those old emails into the universal PDF format.  Acrobat's searching capabilities make even searching through the longest emails easy and accurate.
*	Attaching source files.  Previously, we have been able to create  PDFs from spreadsheet and other formats.  Now, not only can you do that, but this new feature allows you to attach the documents with the PDF!
*	Improved Browser.  Acrobat's browser has been improved to make searching for documents easier.  If you are familiar with the Adobe Photoshop browser, you'll like the new upgraded browser in Acrobat 7.
*	Searching improved.  The search feature has been improved when you are looking for files.  It is easier to search for files, because now Adobe has made the feature more friendly.  You can search by document and text properties on your local computer or across your companies LAN or WAN networked drives.

More About Acrobat
Although many people are familiar with the Acrobat Reader program, they are not as familiar with Acrobat itself.  I consult will many business persons and they are just astounded at what Acrobat 7 can actually do for their business.  Just the fact that you can collect and assemble output from different types of programs into on universal format floors them every time!  

Another great point about assembling the documents in Acrobat is the compression factor.  With Acrobat, users are able to compress the original documents, thus saving space and making it more efficient to transmit the documents via email or internet downloads.

This new version can now also create, and save "PDF/A" files for archiving and it allows users to  scan paper documents directly into a searchable PDF file saving space and time.  Many companies around the country are making the jump to the "paperless" environment.  Acrobat 7 can definitely help.

In fact, I know of an attorney's office making great use of Acrobat.  They have almost converted their entire office to a paperless organization by using Acrobat because of its form creation, reviewing, commenting, approval and signature features.  In paper document storage space alone, this office is saving thousands of dollars per year.  Even legal documents can be approved, digitally signed and verified in Acrobat.

Anyone concerned about the security of their documents has nothing to fear.  Acrobat's security features including the ability to create self-signed digital IDs are terrific; no matter if you have PDF documents loaded on your website for downloading to clients or if you are emailing the files.  For Professional users, Adobe has added a new feature called E-envelopes.  With the new E-Envelopes, user can package their PDF files in an encrypted wrapper and send those files securely via email.  For company networks, Adobe has also added support for your company-wide security policies using a new feature called Lifecycle Policy Service.  The granularity of the security allows the user to pick exactly what they will allow the recipient of the file to do like printing, copying, pasting and so on.  

Many people are also surprised that Acrobat isn't just for static documents.  Users can create interactive forms (Professional Only) as well.  In fact, I know a client who is an attorney.  They have almost converted their entire office to a paperless organization by using Acrobat because of its form creation, reviewing, commenting, approval and signature features.  In paper document storage space alone, this office is saving thousands of dollars per year.

For CAD and graphics professionals who work with 3D files, Acrobat 7 (Professional Only) can now convert these into PDF format for ease of viewing, whether in electronic or printed format.  This will allow the users to quickly send their clients views of the 3D object in the universal PDF format without the purchase of additional software for the recipient of the file.
Another feature is the new licensing capability that Adobe has added to Acrobat 7.  You can install the program and activate it on two separate computers, which is great if you work at home and at the office as well.  Need to install it on a third computer?  Not a problem.  The transfer activation feature allows you to transfer the license to another computer.  To do this, deactivate one copy and transfer the activation via a simple menu command. If your computers have internet access, the change happens right away.  This feature alone may save users money on purchasing multiple copies of the software.
Summary
I would highly recommend this product to anyone in business.  The easy of use and versatility of Adobe Acrobat 7 make it an indispensable tool,  whether you are a legal professional, an IT company, accounting firm, healthcare company or anyone else in business.
This is one investment where the ROI will definitely outweigh the purchase price of the software within weeks of normal use.  The ability to go paperless and save valuable office space that is now gobbled up by filing cabinets, paper binds and closets alone should make the difference for almost any company.
Testing Setup
To conduct tests of the software, the following hardware was used:
PC Compatible System (2 GHz Athlon Processor, 512 MB Ram, 30 GB HD)
Epson Scanner/Fax/Printer
HP LaserJet 8150DN Printer
For software tests (conversion to PDF format), the following software was used:
MS Office 2003 (Word, Excel, Outlook)
Photoshop CS

I'm a longtime Mac user and for re-naming and archiving and cataloguing thousands of images iView Media Pro is the best, I really like the feature that let's you produce and publish on-line galleries of your images, without any code or html experience, using only a very simpe interface and you're ready to go.

For the full-time photographer or amateur, I highly recomend it

This is an all around awesome product. I have had great experiences with the program, and use it very often as we use it to create our entire high school's yearbook. Anyone one who says it doesn't have the basics is pretty much lying to you, it has anything you'll ever need and more. The people who review this product poorly do so because they don't know how to use everything in it. 

The only problem I've ever had is learing everything you can do with it, otherwise it is perfect

Tighter Integration Now Possible with InDesign CS2

Adobe has totally re-done the interface to streamline it and make it cleaner from versions prior to CS.  If you are a QuarkXpress user, you'll find that in InDesign CS2, you get the feeling that it is laid out in a logical and easy-to-use manner.  The tools and tool palettes are where you'd expect them to be in the menu structure and on the screen.  Small touches like being able to save your workspace, like you can do in Photoshop CS2, are great.

I tested the integration between InDesign CS2 and some of its counterparts in the Adobe Creative Suite Premium.  I created different graphics in Photoshop CS2 and Illustrator CS2 and I found it was really easy to import them into InDesign CS2 and use.  You can effects like drop shadows and feathering to images directly in InDesign CS2.  No need to go to another program.  With the Control Palette you can also resize objects too.  This palette functions with Transform and Stroke features for graphics, and it includes paragraph, character and table features for text editing.  What the palette does is affected by the type of selection you have made - either graphic or text. 

I imported some formatted text in from Microsoft Word 2003 and two different tables in from Microsoft Excel 2003.  I was concerned how the tables would appear after the import from Microsoft Excel.  The tables imported easily. With InDesign CS2, you can now automatically style Microsoft Word files on import by mapping Word styles to InDesign CS2 styles as well.

An issue for a long time has been how to preview or view other types of files that you want to incorporate with InDesign CS2.  Now, Adobe "bridges" that gap.  Bridge now comes as a part of InDesign CS2 and the Premium Suite.  So, viewing any Adobe-type formatted file or standard graphic format is easy to do.  Using the same interface between the different programs is a help as well.  Adobe Bridge is a standalone program.

Being a Web Designer and using Adobe (formerly Macromedia) Dreamweaver 8, I was familiar with using Snippets.  These are portions of code you can save for use in other programs or you can export them to give to someone else.  Now,  InDesign CS2 offers this Snippet capability.  You can export objects as snippets. These objects can be shared or reused in other documents. Simply place or drag a snippet into a layout, and  InDesign re-creates the original objects, their formatting, and their relative positioning on the page.  No more wasted time redesigning, just to get something you have brought in from another document to fit.

InDesign CS2 also now has an Info palette that is just like those found in Photoshop and Illustrator.  Size dimensions and resolution are immediately available by selecting the graphic and simply glancing over to the Info palette.  This is a crucial tool when fitting graphics in a specifically space-limited area.  It's important to know the actual dimensions with which you are working.

Sometimes in designing and re-designing printed work, you have to move objects.  When this happens, your structure can often change in different ways.  InDesign CS2 helps you maintain your layout by allowing you to anchor your callouts, pull quotes, margin notes, and graphics to text. You can now precisely control the positioning of Anchored Objects, apply text wrap settings, and more.

As with other Adobe products, it is very easy to export your finished work in PDF format.  InDesign CS2 works so well at exporting to PDF, it even maintains the layers in Acrobat 7.  You can pre-define your Acrobat export settings as well.  InDesign CS2 also supports specialty PDF formats like PDF/X-1a and PDF/X-3, which are used in workflows.  It also supports high-resolution CMYK output and color-managed workflows.

If you are familiar with previous versions of InDesign, the upgrade to the new version is easy.  InDesign CS2 is even backwards compatible CS.  You will find that your learning curve is greatly decreased.

This is the easiest way I've ever been able to make CD's. It realy makes photo CD's easy and produces a great product. A group of frinds and Us just got back from Mexico and I put all of everyones photos in separate files on a CD. The automatic slide show goes through the differn't files as if they were just one file with no seperation, but the pictures are still separated in each person's file for ease when printing and so forth. It's great, wish I would have had this years ago

I have used this software from the very first as a PaintShop product and it still delivers. It has improved with this version. I reckon I have tried all other albums and quick editors but this remains the best. For more detailed work a more expansive editor is needed but that is not the purpose of this program. What it claims to do, it does well. If only it had some way of adjusting the mid tones. A simple histogram would make this a top ranking program

I liked how you could go underwater and try to find things. I also liked how you had to bake cookies and make sundaes. Another really cool thing was that you could buy stuff for Minette and yourself. I didn't like how the tea was so hard,though.I couldn't figure it out,but finally I got it.I liked that you had to fight Minette,too.It was funny that she had an alien tatoo on her face.Over all,Danger By Design was a fun game.

I really enjoy the Nancy Drew games. They can be done as a senior detective with fewer helps or as a Junior detective with a check list of things that need to be done. The check list continues to update as you move through the game. I look forward to each new game as it comes out and can't leave the computer until they are done

I have been playing the Nancy Drew games for a few years now, and have found that with each one the graphics, intrigue & fun just keep getting better & better.

In "Danger by Design" Nancy agrees to go to Paris to help a nervous investor of Minette's House of Fashion.  He's nervous because Minette had begun acting very strangely & had fallen way behind on her new Spring collection - both of which could lead to a failed business venture.

Once there, Nancy becomes aware of several threatening letters the designer had received, as well as a number of rumors concerning artwork that had been stolen during World War II that may be hidden in the old Wind Mill that now serves as Minette's House of Fashion.  Could they be related some how?

As Nancy Drew, you will find yourself snooping around for clues, working to earn the money needed to buy several needed items, solving various puzzles, and ultimately putting all the information together to solve the mysteries surrounding Minette & the stolen artwork.

Overall, I loved "Danger by Design".  It has the best graphics to date for an ND game & it was great fun to play.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who has enjoyed playing other such games, as well as those who enjoyed (or are enjoying) reading the ND series.

If you decide to buy a current greeting card program, there are really only two front-line choices: Art Explosion Greeting Card Factory (currently version 5) or Hallmark Card Studio (currently 2006). There are other programs available specifically for creating cards, but most of them are low quality and outdated, and aren't really worth considering. (A competitive third product featuring American Greetings designs is sadly now long outdated; the designs in the American Greetings program were of similar quality to those in the Hallmark package).

So how do these two products match up? Without a question, if you are looking for quality "canned" cards, the Hallmark program wins. The Hallmark designs are professional, and are equal in quality to cards you would purchase in a store. In contrast, the designs in Art Explosion are adequate but surely NOT up to the quality of a store-bought card. The Hallmark program is also able to simply and correctly print to several different types of card store (although you are stuck with the choices pre-programmed into the software unless you want much frustration). The Art Explosion does a poorer job of correctly and simply printing to a variety of card stock and configurations.

Art Explosion beats the Hallmark program in editing options (more extensive), and in the amount of additional art (clipart, etc.) included with the package.

If you do not plan to use the "canned" cards, then I would recommend Art Explosion. But the average user will likely appreciate the professional, high quality cards in the Hallmark package. Personally, I consider the choice of the Hallmark package over Art Explosion a no brainer. 

A note on versions: The publisher comes out with a new version of the Hallmark program every year (2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, etc.) and the same is true for Art Explosion Greeting Card Factory. Having used many of these versions, I find very little reason to recommend upgrading year by year. Disappointingly, the stock cards in the Hallmark program do not seem to have changed appreciably in many years, and the same is true for Art Explosion.

This program is very easy to use and the projects are beautiful.

Installation is self explanatory. This also goes for the prepararation of cards ect.Detailed instructions apear at each step at the top of the window as the user moves his her mouse-pointer over various portions of the graphics.

 If you are looking for an easy to use program with great results, this is the one to get. With the cost of cards being what it is, this program will pay for itself very quickly. Relatives will like the fact that they are getting greetings which have been personalized. I recommend this  program highly

My dad got this for me to supplement a Latin textbook I have been studying for my high school language course. It is quick and easily understandable. You get plenty of words and phrases, which is perfect for a traveler. If you want to learn the language for the sake of knowing it, not travel, however, you'd better get a book to supplement this. It doesn't teach about pluralization, verb conjugation, or other oddities that the language holds, such as, in Latin, the ending -m which implies a direct object. The Latin CD also does not use the dashes over the vowels (ie. ,,,,). Overall, I am very happy with the product and with the price of $39.99 (USD), but I am also quite glad I have my textbook (ECCE ROMANI) to go with it

This is a great item for any collector or new fans to the X-men. All the older along with the newer issues look great. The CD includes all issues of the Uncanny X-men (1-461) along with Giant Sized and annual issues. There is also comprehensive biographies on the more popular characters and artwork and layouts of the Xaiver Institute. Could it of had more content, maybe, but this will keep one busy for a long time. With easy maneuverabiltity, this is a highly addictive CD with virtually months of entertainment

Nice collection of the complete issues, though, of course, one knows going in that the later Marvel practice of storylines that run through all the books makes the stories provided only a small slice of the full story, which is somewhat frustrating.  

And the earliest years are, of course, somewhat crude (heretically, even the Kirby artwork in the first year is).

But very nice to have in an affordable edition, regardless of the flaws (though best viewed with a large monitor

I've tried this on two different mac computers: an emac desktop and  an ibook G4, it runs perfectly on both. I see that some people are having problems, I'll see if I can help with that at the end of the review.
I'm a huge x-men fan, but can't afford to buy a bunch of back-issues. The essential book collections are affordable, but they're printed in black & white. With this one disc you get almost 500 uncanny issues, including annuals, all are high-quality scan in's. The disc also has a nice little bio section, and comes with the neccessary adobe software. The one down-side is that you miss out on he tie-in issues, whick gets irritating mid-90's, but I'm not docking a star for that because   what you get is well worth the price, and it's clearly stated in the description that this is strictly "uncanny". 
OK, for those of you having trouble getting it to run w/ a mac here's the process:load cd, click cd image on your desktop twice. You'll get a finder window w/ various files/folders, one will have install on it, this should be the adobe software, follow the installation instructions, and move your new adobe reader to applications when finished, restart your computer. Once re-started load the cd again, open adobe reader 6.0 click the folder image in the upper left-hand corner you should have a finder-type window, go to desktop, click on x-men and choose start.pdf. You should be good to go. HT

don't get me started on that latter program, argh
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
Nobody, and I mean NObody, could be more of an Illustrator novice & ignoramus than I.  Several months ago I was given a licensed copy of Illustrator 9 that a departing coworker had used.  Wanting a chance to design the departmental logo that otherwise would've gone to an agency, I raised my figurative hand and volunteered for duty.  Having taught myself everything from MS-DOS to TurboCAD, to Photoshop Elements, not to mention Word, Excel, and Powerpoint (don't get me started on that latter program, argh), I figured I could tackle at least the basics of Illustrator 9.  Loaded it on my laptop, took it home for a weekend....and just about lost my sanity -- and several fingernails -- trying to learn that confounding program.  I managed to produce a few logos, one of which was chosen.  But egads, what a big, stinky bear Illustrator 9 was to wrestle.

When I saw that CS2 had this Live Trace feature, I pleaded with my workplace Santa to get it for me, and WOW!  What an overall improvement!!

Illustrator will still not be as intuitive to pick up as an MS Office product, but this comes darn close.  With CS2, they've given us "hot tips" -- little clues about what some of the tools do, that pop up when you mouse over the tool.  The intuitive menus are nice too.  Also cool is that all the text & paragraph and fill & stroke features, which used to be huge boxes taking up valuable real estate on the screen, are now condensed up on a small horizontal toolbar, like in the Office products ... and when you mouse over them, the screen tips tell you how to expand them.  Aaaahh!  Finally some help for dunces like me.

Live Trace and Live Paint are unbelieveably cool.  The very first thing I did after loading CS2 was to grab a .jpg photo of a soccer ball off Google Images, and within 20 minutes, without consulting any book or online Help, I'd converted it into a simple graphic image painted into the 2 colors I wanted.

But as for a great guidebook, the reviewer who suggested Illustrator Visual Quickstart guide by Elaine Weinmann was dead-on.  I've bought several other "highly rated" books to try to help me through the quagmire of Adobe products, so I've seen them all.  The Visual Quickstart book doesn't have any of that insufferable "wanna-be-a-comic-novel-author" writing, and focuses just on the basics.  And it's very literal, with step-by-step instructions.  Still there's no substitute for the utterly excruciating process of learning Illustrator through experience.  But the Weinmann book's better than any I've seen yet.

The only reason I haven't given this product a 5 is because it still doesn't have the intuitiveness that it needs.  In that way it's still "snobby" -- aimed at pros, not folks like me who need to do occasional stuff but not for a living.  But this is a far, far, far cry better than Illustrator 9.  Absolutely worth the money, just for Live Trace and Live Paint alone

Not bad, however, in Version 10, was able to use CNTRL + to zoom in.  Used the + on the number pad -- now this function doesn't work, and the only + that works is that in the top row of the keyboard.  The zoom out "-" in the number pad still works, but not the plus.  I say that's not good.

Why ruin things with an upgrade

OK, sorry, I've been vectoring line art since 1990. My current machine is an AMD Athlon XP with the 333 FSB, 1 Gig ram & 80 Gig HD shared on network & a 40 Gig HD for software, OS is XPpro, it's 2 years old I think. I installed three cathode ray tubes, you know; big boxy monitors, the largest of which is a 21 inch monster right in my face all day. I read the reviews here and started "Quaking" in my boots! Oops I said to myself, and I looked up my previous day's purchases for the new Artist I just hired. Sure enough; I bought CS2 for the new machine. So I downloaded the 30 day trial for Illustrator CS2 Upyours, I mean Upgrade. Replacing my old Illustrator 8.01 These kids I've been interviewing made me think I should take a look outside MY CAVE! So I got it loaded up and sure enough; it takes longer to load than my old corrupted rusty buddy; Illustrator 8.01, about twice as long. ( so leave it running )

!!!!!!!!! BUT WOW !!!!!!!

I should have done this sooner, or should I have ?
As soon as It was running Illustrator CS2 AUTO UPDATED ITSELF.
It wanted it's Adobe Bridge fixed up. So I let it. This is just exactly what people have been complaining about.

******** THE BRIDGE IS FIXED *********

WAY SUPER COOL DUDE! I keep the Bridge open on the right monitor and I can drag art into Illustrator CS2 at lightning speed. The whole time I get to see super big previews of all the artwork I need to work with. Way better than XPpro's little thumbnails.

LIVE TRACE: Realy nice, I think this is what these companies are using to sell Vectored Line Art to Printers like me. It is very accurate and seems to acomodate all those nasty giant pixels that up till now, took a human brain to see past while vectoring. OK, it's not as good as a skilled craftsman such as (full of) myself, but for only about $160 or so, it's like a gift from ALMIGHTY GOD!

No crashes, no bugs, just pure inteligence from Adobe once again.
Don't you think of a little white mud hut in the dessert when you say ADOBE?

I really apreciate the Object Oriented work bar thing at the top, wait, let me go look at what it's called, Hmmmm, still don't know, well it changes according to what kind of object you've clicked on in your artwork. Also this new wonder of technology solves an old problem of global color change needed for color separation work. That top task bar object oriented do-hickey is similar but better than the one in Photoshop.

Transparent objects, looks like everything can be transparent, WOW, do you know what that means ??? I gotta go use it some more, it's just way to cool. OK, I'm back, EVEN FONTS can be transparent, .tiffs .jpgs, everything. THIS MEANS way less jumping back and forth from Photoshop to Illustrator.

But I do believe you have to be very capable with your hardware, operating system, and have at least a year; full time with Illustrator and Photoshop to fully appreciate the thought and creative potential that Adobe has opened up for us

Maybe I'm just not pro enough to realize the ways to put some more precise reports together, but that is the only snag in this otherwise capable product.

To accomplish the reports that I need, I am able to edit the Gantt chart view sufficiently to satisfy my purpose.  So, it gets the report done, just not as nicely as I had hoped.

Tracking work is made incredibly simple.  Rest assured you can manage a hefty project with this little piece of software

I decided to get this office suite after using it recently. I've usually worked on Office 97 and 2000, but the 2003 version has some pretty cool features not found in the older versions. The feature that I really enjoy is the Pivot Report feature in MS Access, which wasn't in MS Access 2000. This is a truly great reporting feature. You can now use Access as a front-end to slice and dice data stored on data warehouses in Oracle, SQL Server, Sybase and other enterprise-type databases. If you're used to creating crosstab reports, you'll definitely like the Pivot Report feature. Crosstabs are limited to 2 dimensions but there's no limitation on the number of dimensions in Pivot Report.

To me, the main drawback is the price. (I did get mine at around $370 at J&R, which is a great price.) I figure I can upgrade this in about 5 years time, which works out to about $70 to $75 per year (assuming that I'll be paying about $370 to upgrade in 5 years time.)

A big positive is that this is the industry standard. So the work you put into learning the multiple new features of Word, Excel, MS Access is not wasted because you can reuse the same skills in another job. Your time will be well spent. Note that the software may seem bloated but the intelligent user is able to choose and pick the most useful and relevant features of each application and ignore the features that are not useful. Different features are useful to different people...

Another positive: Each product in Office Professional is fully programmable using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) which you can use to build custom programs. This very powerful feature is sometimes overlooked when shopping for Office suites.

You can read it BEFORE buying the product by looking on the ZA site. I'm going to make this hard and make you google it. 
I'm not going to criticize anyone except to say IF you have a question or problem, the ZA website lists pdf file user manuals for all of the company's products. There are some compatibility probs for example with Yahoo Mail BETA. As soon as Yahoo finalizes it's mail server ZA will be compatible. Simply switch back to yahoo mail (pre beta). There are several other beta products but generally if you're having problems they can be easily fixed by adjusting the settings just like all security programs. ZA REALLY is better at what it is suppose to do than other products ONCE you have learned how to use it. Kinda like most things in the world of things that are unfamiliar. 
I use the free stuff too, and recommend them for those who are on a budget - students, etc. but the ZA suite is worth the money and is more effective for those who can't afford to get mugged or pickpocketed on the info hiway. I know what you're thinking btw...but ask yourself "Is your private information, time  and computer worth it to you?" If so go with Zone Alarm, learn how to use it and be safer on the net.

As you can see by other reviews above, the Studio series has a history of being buggy.  You also hear a lot of people saying "This package is so much more intuitive and easy to use than the other 'powerful enough to be worth owning' packages -- if only it were more stable!"  

I am one of those long-suffering users (5 years, going back to Version 9), and finally with Version 10.6 I have stopped complaining -- it now works as I'd hoped when I bought it.  The $300 I spent on other packages trying to do better was wasted -- I kept getting frustrated with interfaces that a 500-page manual couldn't clarify.  And I'm a very sophisticated computer user by most measures.

I am turning all of our old family video tapes and CD's into DVD's.  I use Studio for all the editing (have not tried the DVD recording -- just use Roxio for that) and am now very pleased.  If you own 10.5 then version 10.6 is a free download.

One important piece of advice that would have saved me lots of problems: put every "project" you work on in a separate subdirectory.  If you have 5 soccer game videos make a /game1, /game2 etc. series of subfolders.  If you edit those to a "Jimmy's great plays" proect, put it in a separate /JimmyPlays folder.  When projects are in the same folder and you edit them a few times weird overwrite problems can happen in 10.5.  I learned this trick before 10.6 came out, and I don't know if it matters any more but I take no chances.

Why did I stick with something where I admit that version 9.0 was "powerful but unstable" and 10.0 was "more powerful and more unstable"?  Because I can actually use Studio with minimal reference to instructions, and when I use it things turn out as I expect.  Now that it has become stable and reliable I am a VERY satisfied customer.

So that's how I got from being a frustrated Studio customer to giving it 4 stars on this review.  I tell the whole story so you understand that the other reviews from frustrated people are relevant for the older versions, but that "10.5 updated for free to 10.6" really is the best choice out there now... as my unused expensive rivals to Studio on my shelf prove.  Just keep putting every project inn its own folder!

I have had nothing short of an excellent experience with this product. I have created numerous videos of my children's escapades and sporting events. I do have one warning however. Provide the grandparents with a box of tissues because they never fail to cry when they see their little angels parading across the widescreen. The software is extremely intuitive and easy to use. My wildest expectations were exceeded.

Previously I owned ColorVision's Spyder2 program and was quite satisfied with it.  It did not include, however, a program for correcting the printer's color rendition. The new Spyder2Pro includes PrintFix Plus.  This along with the monitor correction Spyder2Pro works very effectively.  I am very happy with the program. For the price it is a great addition to Photoshop editing.  The Spyder program allows the monitor and printer to show a print that reflects what the user has taken in his digital camera. I have not found any particular negatives about the program.  In the past I have used their tech service for fine tuning the program.  They were very responsive and helpful.

I have read several reviews and decided the Spyder2Pro would be a good monitor color calibrator for me.   I have a Samsung 970P monitor with all adjustments via software.   The calibration process is very simple and all you have to do is follow the menu of questions during the calibration process.
I like the Spyder2Pro and would recommend it highly.

It does the basic job well.  The calibration runs smoothly and accurately.  Hardware looks and feels solid.  My two completely different brand, size and age CRT monitors ended up with exactly the same colors sitting side by side. 
 
User interface is merely adequate.  Pop up help instructions are better than many I have seen.  You will need to know already how the calibration buttons on your monitors work (the hardwired buttons on the monitor, not software).  In order to make any edits you must run the entire time consuming calibration over.  Sometimes you can use "back" within the calibration, sometimes you must start over.  Also the separate "profile chooser" utility software, has not add or delete profile feature - even if it is a profile created and saved by the calibration software earlier.  You can see it with windows display properties, but it may not appear in the profile chooser list.

Dual monitors is the one obvious reason to choose pro over plus version.  Yes, it does dual monitors, but with an asterisk.  It will create separate profiles, but will only apply the correct profiles automatically at startup to both monitors if you have two separate video cards.  If you have a single video card with dual outputs, it will load the same profile (the last one you created) to both monitors at startup.  This quirk is documented in a readme file on the installation disk (and blames windows for the problem), but this limitation appears nowhere in advertising material, catalogs,  or on the box.  Fortunately there is a work around (not documented) at least with my particular video card and running XP.  After windows opens, you can run profile chooser then choose the correct profile for each monitor.  You may have to use windows display properties settings to specify default profile and rerun the calibration to get the profiles you want to appear in profile chooser and to select the correct profile as default. 

Once it's all set up, running profile chooser is a four of five click procedure, but you must rememeber to check it before using any application that uses color profiles.  And check it after you open the application.  I've had them change after opening photoshop - though not every time.

This program is positively wonderful for word practice and pronunciation with a number of flash-card style game and  a very elegant listen-record-replay interface. While the two characters do pronounce words slightly differently, hearing those variations really helps to understand the phonetics in a way that a single voice would lack.

However, this really is more of a companion tool for a more traditional course. I purchased this with "Colloquial Icelandic" and would definitely recommend purchasing them together. There are some extremely strange spelling/pronunciation variations and without having a written explanation of these things, you may be left staring in great confusion as the characters read phrases on screen -- "Hva" is pronounced "kwah?" WHAT? Having "Colluquial Icelandic" to turn to for explanation helped a great deal. That package has two audio CDs of alphabet, number, vocabulary and conversation exercises with a very well-written 370 page coursebook.

I gave this product a 5-star rating as it is superb for its intended purpose, but it does not stand alone as a complete course

I just upgraded my Webster software to this version for WinXP.  It's ok and does the job it's intended to perform. But I liked the previous versions that displayed both the definitions and the thesaurus in parallel panels. Just a matter of display preference, so it's not that important to every user.

I used this program on a 5-state road trip of the Midwest, and while overall it was  "adequate," it had some key shortcomings.

The bad stuff:

First, this is not an especially user-friendly program; there is a steep learning curve to operate it with ease and predictability. Spend a LOT of time playing with this BEFORE using it as a primary navigator! A lot of the commands are not intuitive, and you need to go through a lot of menus to figure things out. This can be a problem when you are on the road looking to get somewhere. It doesn't have a lot of clickable buttons on the main screen. For example, to get the program to TALK to you, you must be on a certain tab at the bottom of the screen. If you are on any other of the many tabs, the program doesn't talk to you or show you the turns. It took me HOURS to figure this out! The help function was useless.

Second, the tracking can be very slow, and as a result you can easily overshoot your turns--especially when there are no physical street signs in many areas of the country--which happened to me numerous times. Many times the screen showed me I had a lot farther to go before the scheduled turn, and this caused me to overshoot it when there was no sign.

Third, the "rerouting" function is AWFUL and perhaps the biggest problem with this program: if you stray from the route--even to pull off and get gas--the program flips out and keeps trying to route you back to the original route even if that route is not the easiest or most direct. I have not found a way for it to manually or automatically calculate a new and different route. I also have found no way to modify a route once you begin the route (see below).

Several times in several different cities, the re-routing function was totally wrong--spitting out names of streets that weren't even on the screen at close zoom level. This is a really annoying glitch, and it happened without fail every time I strayed from the route. Once off route, there is no way to hush the program from yelling at you that you're off route, and there is also no way to easily have the program recalculate a CHANGE in the route. When there is construction that you didn't anticipate, for example, this program sucks at being able to change the route once you've started on it. Very annoying. There is no construction updater plug-in, which would be helpful for long term construction projects that go on forever. 

Fourth, the program does NOT audibly warn you if you are going the wrong way on a one way street. This actually happened to me, as there were no "one way" signs on a particular street in Springfield, IL. Though there were green arrows on the screen to indicate one-way, but the voice commands didn't warn me that I actually WAS going the wrong way, so had I not been looking at the screen, I wouldn't have known. You can't always look at the screen when driving. And in Iowa on I35, construction brought northbound drivers over to the southbound lanes. I was heading north in the southbound lanes (as I was supposed to) but there was no visual or audible indication that I was going the wrong way! Big time safety issue here.

Fifth, the search function is wholly lacking and is not easy to use. I needed to find a police station while in Missouri--no such luck. I also needed to find the state fairgrounds in Missouri (which I later came across on the screen) but it did not show up when I intentionally searched for it. Search limitations are the second biggest problem with this program.

Sixth, several times the screen showed me "off route" in a totally blacked-out area with no roads around me when I was in fact on a U.S. highway or interstate. Something wasn't communicating correctly. Other times the screen showed me more than 1000 feet off the highway even though I was certainly on the highway. In Illinois, the screen showed I was pretty much driving through corn fields even though I was on a U.S. Route. This problem is pronounced on multi-lane highways. If you're not in the center lane, often the program indicates you're off route. Very annoying.

Seventh, the zoom level does not stay constant; it fluctuates automatically between high zoom and far-out zoom. I wanted high zoom most of the time to see all the minor roads and landmark indicators, but the program kept zooming out and in every few minutes.

Eighth, the help function is a joke. It is totally lacking in substantive information. The program should come with a separate DVD movie showing how to use it.

Ninth, the program does not recognize a lot of road name synonyms. For example, some U.S. Routes also have county/state/local designation numbers and/or an alphabetic name, but the map often only listed one or two of the many "also known as" names/numbers. This can be quite problematic when the signs on the roads don't match up with the turn commands (e.g. "Turn left on U.S. route 40," when the only street signs showed an alphabetic name and no numbers. This was also quite annoying.

Tenth, the antenna that comes with the program SUCKS. Without fail, I would get a red "no signal" indicator in every city I was in where there were high-rise buildings. This happened in Kansas City, Des Moines, Indianapolis, and Springfield. If you are in a city, you risk having no GPS tracking ability. And yes, my antenna was mounted as recommended. At one point I held it up through my open sun roof with no success.

Eleventh, the main-screen buttons are way too small for use while driving if the laptop is on your passenger's seat. You pretty much have to pull over OR risk crashing to see what you're clicking on. Yes, I'm aware that the disclaimer for the program states you should have a separate navigator to operate the program while driving. I'm also aware that almost no one who uses this program actually has a navigator/operator.

Twelfth, trip planning is lacking. When you input a starting and ending point, the program gives you ONE route. There is no way to easily plan alternate routes or to preview them. True, you can do things like program it not to take you on toll roads, but this function is not easy to use. Several times the program kept me off the interstates when I wanted to be on them, and sometimes it kept my on the interstates when I wanted to be on U.S. or smaller county roads (for sightseeing purposes). I would have to go off route and listen to the program whine about being off route.

Thirteenth, I emailed a list of my concerns/constructive criticisms/recommendations to the folks at Delorme. Never heard back from them, which does concern me as a quality issue.

Ok, so there were some redeeming qualities:

First, *in general* the GPS tracker was on-target. For about 95% of my 2000-mile trip, I knew where I was and the program operated just fine. Just realize that this program (as well as GPS in general) has a lot of limitations, ESPECIALLY when there is bad weather or you are in a woodsy area or place with a lot of obstructions.

Third, you can easily add points of interest and comments yourself. I used this function a lot to mark places where I want to return to take photos in daylight.

Fourth, there is a selectable function to show high contrast colors (black background with bright road colors). This is quite helpful.

In summation, for the money this program is a good deal, but do NOT rely on it (or any GPS program) as your *sole* source of road information/navigation. If I hadn't had my Rand McNally paper road atlas and back-up state and city maps I borrowed from the library, I would have been in big trouble several times.

There are a LOT of ways this program can and should be improved, but in the meantime I'd still recommend it despite the problems. Knowing the limitations that I've listen can save you time and frustration. There is no better alternative IMHO for the price. It's possible that some of my complaints DO have fixes, but you wouldn't know it from the crappy help function.

This is my first experience with GPS.  This product makes using it a simple experience with on board instructions.  Viewing the screen on a Laptop as opposed to most of the Portable GPS units is a definite advantage to the user.  I would purchase another immediately if the need arose.

i have a question about this.  I'm wondering if i can hook my guitar into my computer and record it and then like add drums and loops an stuff onto it.  Is that possible on this program?  Cause my friend has Acid Pro 4.0 and that is really awesome but it's like $400 and i dont have that kinda money.  Wut i liked about Acid  Pro 4.0 is that you could hook up ur guitar to the computer and stuff like that, so im wondering if you can do that on this program.  If u have an answer for me, e-mail me at PeepilotT@aol.com .

I discovered this software by accident, while window shopping, and I ended up buying it and taking it home.  I was able to get it up and running pretty quickly, and was creating my own music right out of the box.  Of course it takes some time, but this program makes it possible to make some pretty good music in your spare time.  Add a mic to your computer,and you can pretty much turn your computer into a recording/editing studio, make your own music and burn it to CD.  Sounic Foundry also makes it easy to publish your work to the web, by providing an online community of Acid music-makers who review and comment on one anothers' work.  You can also listen to music published by other users.  Even if you're just a musical legend in your own living room, this makes it easy and fun to become just that.  Sound Forge also sells music loops on CD especially for Acid, but you can find lots of free loops on the web that also work.  Sound Forge also provides weekly samples for free on their Acid Planet website

This one is definately the best out of all of the previous ACID Music programs.  It has a ton of loops, a really cool looking skin, and much more options than in ACID 1.0 or 2.0.  It comes with two CDs.  One of them has the application on it with some loops and the other CD has nothing but loops and demo songs!  It has over 1,600 unique loops!  Definately a good buy for those who really liked any of the previous ACID Musics

This is a good package for backing up your PC.  Fairly intuitive, although it took me a couple tries to figure out what the software was doing so I could select the right stuff to backup.  It uses good compression to minimize the amount of disk for your backup.  The downside of that is you can't just select a file to restore, you must go through the restore process.  You can select a single file, but it takes a bit of time.  Runs automatically and unobtrusively so it won't interfere with your current work.

I had access to the CD version of this product that came with the Image Library Catalog in the box. I liked using it and although there was a lot of CD disc-trading with 34 discs, it worked well for me. I could usually go to the disc I wanted on the first attempt.

Later, I wanted to add this collection to my home office and went back to the same store where the original version was bought. They had sent back all the CD editions where the image catalog was included in the box and replaced them with the DVD edition that is only 5 discs and you have to send off for the catalog for the low low price of shipping ($4.95). Whenever I go to use the DVD's, I have to wait a long time for the dics to load into memory and almost forever if I request the thumbnail versions to come up in the browser.

I would rather switch discs any day then spend my time staring at the monitor while waiting for the computer to load my information. The store involved is happy because they are using less box space on the shelf (or so the stock personnel said). I am unhappy at having to send off for the manual that says it's included on the box but isn't, the extra money for the shipping, and the awkwardness to use this 'upgraded' product

Good for those looking for a vector collection.  Not so good for those looking for photo clip art, as photos are "high-res" at 200 DPI.  I suppose the photos are useful to an extent, but the usefulness is limited by size.  I was looking for vector art, so I am satisfied

I've been looking at buying this collection for some time now and I finally broke down and bought it.  Very pleased with everything included.  LOTS of stuff to use, and not just cheezy clip art - lots of boarders, symbols, brush strokes, etc.  The bundle that i bought contained 1 wrong disc (disc 3 was actually disc 30) - one phone call and a new one was sent to my house no questions asked.

   I am so pleased with this purchase!! Under normal circumstances if I spend anything over $1.00 I get caught in a spiral of buyers regret. This is a feeling that I have grown accustomed to. When I received the 800,000 through the mail I shredded open the box and started skimming through what new images I could play with. I was astonished!      
   Then, I realized something.....or rather a lack of something. I felt no remorse for buying this! I finally had a collection of clip art that could provide an abundant amount of images for collages, labels, calendars, scrapbooks, and everything else I wanted to do.

For many who like writing HTML/XHTML code, Homesite holds a special place in the heart.  It just feels so right and is addictive.

The tool can be extended, and the extensions use script which makes the development cycle dead easy.

Support from MacroMedia has not been good.  Now Adobe is in the process of buying Macromodia (as on 2005-04-19) so who knows where it all goes.  Saying that people who like this product still like it and prefer it.  If it fits you don't need support.  You just run it day after day and it works great.

(There are alternatives emerging after all these years but none quite do it yet.  CSE and TopStyle are two that are coming along.)

For some it almost seems perfect, for WYSIWYG oriented people, it might be best not to even look at it

Homesite is widely recognized as "the" premier tool for coding HTML, client side, and server side code by hand. Adding it to your resume won't land you a job, but it will certainly boost your chances of getting an interview because it indicates that you are not a cheap, WYSIWYG junkie.

One of the things I like best about Homesite 5 is the adaptability it allows when coding in ASP.NET. I was able to find a plug-in, which when added to Homesite, recognized the .NET tags and colors them accordingly. There are similar plug-ins for just about every language out there.

If you are unfamiliar with HomeSite, are considering a purchase, but are not sure it's the right tool for you, here's a very brief description on how it works: This is not a drag-and-drop design tool that created the code for you. It is, in essence, a text editor on steroids. As you code BY HAND it will color the code for you, tell you when you've made errors, offer you a ton of help on knowing what tags mean, has a built in FTP client, helps you organize your work into projects, and a bunch of other functions I've never used.

Here's the main thing you need to know: If you're a HomeSite pro, then you are also a REAL developer.

To everyone who has whined about lack of support: What do you expect for less then $100? If you purchase a flagship product from Macromedia such as Dreamweaver, Studio MX, or Fireworks, you'll get all the support you'll need.

Also, I've been able to find PLENTY of FREE support from news groups and email lists that focus on web development. For every problem or question I've found someone who knows the solution. You can too!!!

Just a note: Amazon is behind the times. From the Macromedia website you can now purchase two versions ahead of what Amazon is offering.

Well worth the $99.00

...and I knew it wouldn't be the last. Very very fun. Don't think Nancy Drew is just for girls, guys can play and love the game as well. I am living proof of that.

The game itself really isn't that hard, it is just some of the puzzles can be very tricky (I don't like puzzles) and that is the only 'beef' I have with the game, and most mystery games. 

Now, back to the game itself.. intriguing storyline, suspicous characters and they all got something to hide. Search for clues while interrogating suspects.. explore the resort, run errands, break into locked rooms without getting caught, disable alarms, and SNOOP.. and that is just the tip of the iceburg.

If  you like mystery games, Nancy Drew is for you! Her games aren't overly hard, and they are very fun. Even if you aren't a mystery fan, try it! You'll love it. Try them all! You will become a Nancy Drew fan, trust me.. I did

This was a wonderful game!  Hours of good, solid game play.  An interesting mystery and intriguing characters.  A chance to interact with aquatic life.  I learned how to work a GPS and a HAM radio.  It was so much fun.  The puzzles were a good mix of ability-levels and types.  Word puzzles, spatial puzzles, problem-solving ones.  I can completely recommend this game

This is by far my favourite HER Interactive Nancy Drew PC game, and I have played them all multiple times. I loved the food aspect of it [my sister's a chef], in the cafe where you could gyp the game into letting Nancy have a muffin or a bowl of delicious New England clam chowder anytime you wanted to making a sandwich for Katie; AND calling Bess and George to hear how Bess is learning to cook from a TV show and hearing her worry about what she's making.

The puzzles were not nearly as difficult as some more recent games make them; they were challenging but doable, took some moving about and kept the game adventurous. The bike riding was inventive, rather than a train or car or what have you, and I loved being down by the lighthouse, near the water.

I believe it is one of HER Interactive's best games so far and is the best bet for a Nancy Drew gamer

This has been a good purchase for us.  We are in northern Italy for about 7 weeks, and needed to navigate a number of cities: for several business meetings and just to find our way around.  It has been an invaluable tool.  We have still used physical maps to a certain extent, but in finding the shortest routes, and other points of interest, this has helped us never to be lost (so far!

If you have used MS Streets & Trips, then you'll know your way around AutoRoute.  We are using this to plan a trip to Europe next May.  Based on my knowledge of locations in Britian, the software appears to be pretty accurate.  If you want to use this with a GPS that does not come bundled with the package, expect some frustration.  I still have not figured out how to get it to talk to my USB based Garmin unit.  I think it is possible, just do not know how.

As far as GPS software goes, there is nothing better available than Streets & Trips and AutoRoute.  There are dozens of features that you can't find with the self-contained GPS units.  It is easy to add multiple stops and to optimize them into the best order, night-view is another great feature, as are the topographical maps.  The new feature offered this year, of easy-linking to satellite photos of places on the map, is also a welcome addition.  

The only reason I'm giving it a four is because of the following:

1)  There is STILL no ground-level or 3D view of the roads for use in the GPS function

2)  They still haven't added an option to exclude roads that ban trucks or commercial traffic form using them.

3)  There isn't a lot of coverage for Eastern European countries, most notably, nothing in Russia.

Nonetheless, it is still better than any other GPS software on the market

Easy to install and get started.  I purchased it to manage my digital photo's and not to do sophisticated picture editing or enhancements for publishing.  It's been easy to use for my purposes.  If you are planning on doing professional level editing or graphic manipulation, do more homework on the robustness of this product.  I can't comment on it's capabilities for that purpose

For those already familiar, I was excited about this edition when it was advertised that it now works with RAW files.  This one of the advantages that Adobe Photoshop Elements has.  I have a Nikon Digital SLR and I often shoot in RAW and have to convert to .jpg if I want to edit with Microsoft Digital Imaging.  When I went out to buy this "Anniversary" edition, in very small print it reads that it's the same as the previous 2006 edition "except" support for RAW files is no longer included.  Still, it was on sale ($24) and I thought an upgrade would be cool.  When I used it, I saw little or no difference in this than the Microsoft Digital Image 10 I had already been using.  In my opinion, upgrading from 10 isn't worth it. 

For those new to this product, let me start by saying, I've been a long time user of Microsoft's digital imaging products.  I enjoy the bright, clean look of the interface.  More that that, I love how simple it is to use.  I would recommend Microsoft Digital Image to all skill levels, but especially anyone who's just starting out in Digital Photography and computers.  Hands down, it's the easiest.  It does in one step what would take three Photoshop Elements.  You sacrifice come control, but simplicity is the focus of this program.  Adobe Photoshop Elements is more powerful, but harder to use.  Bottom line is, if you want to concentrate on getting out and taking good pictures instead of spending lots of time editing, get Microsoft Digital Imaging.  For the average shutterbug, It'll edit just as good as Photoshop Elements in less time and for less money.

I have the older version which was great but doesn't seem to work on WIN XP. Both do a great job especially when you need an emergency card. 2006 edition has a great added feature of being able to choose the size format for your card, big plus. The graphics are nice and there are many choices. It's a good deal at the price

Learn Catalan is a fun activity and a good learning experience for those with no spanish base; however, i have taken about 5 years of Spanish and found the CD to be fairly basic, and while catalan differs in many ways, many of the things they teach are not as useful as i would hope.   There are a lot of items and phrases neccessary to be a tourist.   I definitely have benefitted from this CD because i can hear the way the language is pronounced and become more absorbed in it.  Overall, great for beginners, and only slightly helpful for someone with spanish knowledge

Remember....this is a software program and may require you to purchase appropriate hardware to compliment!

PRO's: Easy to install, somewhat intuitive to use. Up and running in no time. Imports Digital Video fairly simply. Speed of production is directly related to your equipped home computer. Stability of program is strong point. Does what it says it can do. Didn't make any coaster on first attempts to use. Finish product runs well on all DVD players.

CON's: Needs more style templates. Needs an imbedded sound translator for music track imports. Steeper then normal learning curve with less then optimum manual explanations

I've only just begun using this software, but have not found it to be so easy to use for a novice at film editing or to make a slideshow. I would have liked to have seen better and more tutorials. I find the tutorial confusing. So far I have been able find most of the answers to my questions through the Help section, but it just isn't as straight forward as I would have liked. I purchased this b/c it was rated so high by PC Magazine. I'm sure in time I'll learn the software better, but it just seems more challenging and not as easy to learn as most sofware I have taught myself to use.

Simple and Great video editing software considering it is for the normal and home user. I would say it is the beginner to Intermediate user tool. I can really create fast movies very quickly. 

Pros:
Easy to install
Easy to split/edit Home videos
Compatible with iLink
Support for High Definition HDV Camcorders
Competitive price

Cons: 
User Interface can be confusing at the beginning to understand and placement of workspace windows.

Rendering is slow.

I do a pretty good bit of video production. I have used let's say most of them in the quest of finding a video editor that would do the real things I need. Ulead Video Studio 10 Plus is pretty good, but it lacks in the audio section. Pinnacle: not worth the bucks I paid for it at Best Buy. Magix: nice but seriously lacking the depth needed in the audio section.
I had used Premiere Pro before and liked a lot of the features provided in it but the price, my god, was just too much. I found Premiere Elements on Amazon and hoped that it would do the job. It did.
Elements 3 has almost and I say almost features as does Premiere Pro. Some features have been streamlined for the amateur but learning to use Elements has been fun and productive. 
I would recommend Adobe Premiere Elements 3 to any intermediate to advanced video editing person

There is no other product which compares to the Microsoft Office suite. "Microsoft Office Standard Edition" is the place to get started. And it is the place you'll probably stay.

You do need Word and Excel, and occasionally, PowerPoint. Learn basic word processing and spreadsheet usage. Shine in meetings with PowerPoint.

Do you need to upgrade from XP? Not likely. There are no new features I found impressive after having the XP version for years.

It lacks Access, but most people don't need the database strength of it, and will survive nicely with just Excel.

For e-mailing documents and files to coworkers, you can be confident they'll easily open Office files. There is a good chance they use it themselves.

Outlook is one of those highly underrated, but enormously useful applications to help you organize your contacts, schedule and tasks easily. You can use it as an e-mail reader as well, though that feature has been vulnerable to viruses.

Word is a huge program which can do far more than you'll need, but it will allow you versatility and simplicity that WordPerfect has yet to pull off.

Excel is a basic spreadsheet with incredible math functionality. I don't need most of the math tools, other than minor budgets and such. I find it handy for tracking my poetry submissions; I can see which magazine I sent which piece to when, and how and when they replied.

PowerPoint makes those cool slideshows with the text that can be animated on the screen. With the templates, you can look good without requiring a graphic design degree.

I fully recommend "Microsoft Office Standard Edition." It is the business and home office standard. You need it, it is easy to learn, and the price is right.

I have used Synmatec products for many years and have been fairly pleased by them.  However, don't buy the upgrade or renew your subscription until AFTER your current subscription runs out because Synmatec will not give you credit for the un-used portion of your previous subscription.  I asked and they said "no way".  That aspect of "customer service" is very disappointing

I installed Norton Antivirus 2007 immediately after installing Windows Vista, Office 2007 and other software on a new computer.  Installation ran smoothly.  LiveUpdate ran automatically and updated the product without a hitch.

Norton AntiVirus 2007 not only detects viruses, it detects spyware and rootkits as well.  It has an inbound firewall, and apparently some limited outbound firewall capabilities.  It does not protect against phishing, identity theft, or spam, nor does it contain full outbound firewall protection.

When installed on Windows Vista, Norton Antivirus takes over for Windows Defender and the Windows Firewall.  I did not expect the latter; Symantec should have made it more clear that this product includes a software firewall.  Norton AntiVirus integrates well with Windows Security Center.

Norton AntiVirus 2007 is noticeably quicker both in normal operation and during full scans than previous versions. Norton AntiVirus has always performed well in industry comparisons against other antivirus products. The only other product that I would use myself is McAfee VirusScan, but I have always felt that Norton AntiVirus does a more aggressive job of protecting my system.

For those of you installing Norton AntiVirus 2007 as an upgrade, I would highly recommend that you first remove any existing Norton security products using Add/Remove Programs in the Control Panel.  Then, download and run the  Norton Removal Tool from the Symantec site to make sure that it's all gone.

To see a comparison chart of the Norton 2007 Windows protection products as of this posting date, browse to Symantec's site, click on "Norton 2007 Products" under Home Products, click on related link "View All Products" and then click "Compare" next to PC Security.

I have not spent tons of time working with the program yet, but have done enough to know that the learning curve is reasonable if you are somewhat publishing program literate. It has lots of potential for aiding in visualizing what your project will look like finished. If you are willing to invest some time to learn the program features, it performs as promised

I was a little skeptical about this program  - until I tried it last evening for the first time. I am really impressed.....  I did not even use the tutorial before I dove in and tried to play a bit.  I created a single room in less than 3 minutes, using simple walls, doors, windows, and a fireplace.  Adding flooring and coloured walls was so easy it was almost sinful!  LOL

I am most anxious to do more with the program and learn about all its capabilities.  Today I watched the tutorial and was really surprised at how much this program can do!  

I am entering into an interior design program in January 06 and wanted to "play" with the CAD software in advance.  I was really happy and impressed with the simplicity of the Better Homes and Gardens version as the idea of CAD seemed intimidating.  Not any more....

I whole-heartedly recommend this program to everyone who is considering designing their interiors or for students of interior design who have not yet attempted any CAD programs.

Impressed with the way it clears out viruses, spyware, and Trojans---I can look at what it's doing or just let it do it. That all goes well. What I don't like is it requires a password for everything even my usual automatic sign-me-in sites and I can't figure how to change this. So the instructions are not as specific as would be helpful

I tested numerous anti-virus programs after getting fed-up with previous Norton Anti-virus, which would always "hang" my incoming email, causing me to redownload larger files and sometimes make it impossible to retrieve them at all. (Incidentally, this had nothing to do with the "time-out" settings.) 

After testing other top rated anti-virus programs, the only one that wouldn't "hang" large email files, was Kaspersky. Even though I have my "time-out" set to only 1 minute, Kaspersky never stumbles and lets go, even if it takes much more than 1 minute to download.

I also like the easy to use "pause protection" when I'm doing file clean-ups, because there's no sense passing temporary files through a second time, and it speeds the clean-up 5 times faster

I am not a computer geek or techie at all, most software and hardware changes always make me hold my breath and cross my fingers.  I recently purchased the Kaspersky Anti Virus based on the review of it in Consumers Reports.  It installed easily, updates automatically and frequently.  Very satisfied with it.

I have got a virus that cause files "comment.htt" appeared in many folders and my previous antivirus can detect them but can not destroy that virus. I tried to use another 2 antiviruses but not effective. So I try KAV and it works! Also KAV does not slow my computer like some big-named antivirus. Autoupdate feature is cool. We do not have to click anything and the prize is reasonable

This is one program that in my opinion you get more than what you pay for I have several Immaging programs that I use for several different things. This one is a delight to use and does a great job taking most of the work off the user. Its a microsoft program that is very user friendly and easy to use. However you do have to be some what computer savy, (like know where to turn on the computer kind of thing) not like some of the 1 star comments that were made here by other folks. I would recomend it to all people that need a simple to use program. Its not what you pay for something its what you do with it after you get it

Not sure how I got it, but I got a browser hijacker that adaware and spybot wouldn't get rid of.  On top of that I got a trojan that these programs and my avast antivirus wouldn't get rid of.  So out of desperation to do something quickly, I went to B.Buy and bought this for $40.  They didn't have a large selection, so I put down the money for it.  Imagine my  feeling when I saw it on amazon for $20.  Still this product works well.  It made me uninstall spybot, adaware, and  turn off my windows firewall to install it.  You can install it on 3 different computers, or it asked you to switch your license from one of them, should you install it a fourth time.  So you can install it more than 3 times, you jsut have to switch your lisenses..understand?  Product works very well and got rid of my problems.  You get updates for 1 year, and then you have to renew.  I think this is stupid personally, but its the Trend now days.  Its a rip...you pay $40 for spyware or virus protection and it should be good for more than a year.  Several annoying windows pop up from time to time asking me what I want it to do.  I wish there was some default user setting so the program could do it.  The firewall slows down your connection, but they all do.  I have 3MG DSL and my speed test are down around 1300K, so I've lost alot of bandwith.  I guess its worth the protection.  Before with spybot and adaware, the spyscans would typically find 25+ issues of spyware.  Now with Trend Micro, I find only 5 to 10 issues on my weekely scan.  So I'm happy with the product, except for my decrease in DSL speed

I have been using PC-Cillin after dumping McAfee following some lousy customer support with no issues. This new version I was very concerned after reading all of the reviews. It does seem to slow things a little on my AMD PC if I am running all of the options I can run but even with them it is tolerable. I am sure you would not want to run this on anything less but it does work and managing it has been simple.

I have used this anti-virus since 2000, I liked it then, and I love it now.
If your the type of user that does not want to worry about your computer on the internet, this is for you.
It can be a pain on older computers that have less RAM, but it still gets the job done. 
Now the cons, I had 3 experiences with customer service, and 2 were postitive, and 1 was negative. I'm not throwing the baby out with the bath water, although I wanted too.
The woman was extremely rude, to the point that I contacted the corporate office.
In the end I did renew my subscription.

I had no idea how easy it is for exe programs, and the such to change settings on your computer allowing attacks. This software lets you know when your settings have changed as soon as they get changed.
For 20.00 how can you go wrong!

Switched from Panda Anti-Virus to this one.  Great software, very sensitive settings.  It was quite aggrevating at first getting constantly interrupted in other programs to be told of various things going on.  Finally got each feature individually adjusted to settings I can live with, and it works great.  They could improve the filtration time (long) to analyze your computer (I only have a 40gig HD with about 20gig used) as it takes about 20-25 mins. to do the complete cleansing process.  However, first time I ran it after having run Panda for the last time, it caught 2 undetected trojans Panda missed.  It also isolated a hidden file trying to access the internet for "updates" that I still have not been able to identify, but it's zapped.  Overall, best I've seen so far, and you can install it on up to 3 computers from one cd (just name each installation with a different username to accomplish, all perfectly legal with the 3 User CD deal).  I have 3 laptops covered at a cost of about $13 each - I'll take that all day long

My feelings are...if you have simple income, not a lot of financial dealings, this program will walk you thru your returns with no difficulty. I've only done Fed & State with 2 incomes, 1 home, with all the associated deductions and the program handled everything. Using the program is a snap and it saves me about $200-300 over using a tax preparer, who asks me questions just like this program does. You simply need to sort out all your receipts, etc., the same as you need to do for a live preparer

Bought this primarily for my TIVO set, so I could transfer and burn DVD's from my  TIVO box. Once I hooked up my mac G5 to the TIVO box, Toast worked perfectly. Easy interface, fast transfer, easy to burn. It's nice to know that TIVO supports Mac. A great product!!

I love Toast, and have had it since version 3.  Don't have TiVO, so can't comment on usability, but for everything else it works better than software that comes with Mac.  Can't wait to try double-density and Blu-Ray, with which this is compatible.  Even earlier versions could burn more different kinds of media than the burn software that came with the Mac.  A friend of mine just switched from PC to Mac, and this was the first software that I suggested he buy.  As another reviewer said, if you have Toast, you don't need Popcorn.  The best!!

I was a little leary about purchasing this product, having never tried anything like it before and being fairly new to the computer world.  I was delighted to find how easily the Toast 8 system worked for me.  The owner's manual is VERY specific, and while I am still discovering all the capabilities of this software, I have found it to be extremely useful.  I recommend this product very highly

I am very excited about the additions to Toast 8.  I am still learning how to use all of them.  The connection with TiVo is one of the most exciting new items.  I have connected and reviewed Tivo recordings through Toast.  I have not had an opportunity to use toast for a DVD yet.

This product is great.  It is simple to use and offers everything you need to do cd and dvd recording.  The addition of tivo to go transfers and dvd menus make this product a true winner.  The only problem I have encountered is the length of encoding recordings from tivo to burn them to dvd.  If you need to record audio or video to cd or dvd this is the product you need.  Don't wast time with anything else

I purchased Elements because frankly,I couldn't afford the whole big Adobe enchilada.I have found it to be pretty intuitive.Lots and lots of options as to organization,photo-tweaking and such. I have had a lot of fun messing around with the program and my digital photos.
I do have two other imaging programs,and with the addition of Elements,I feel like I'm basically well-set with zillions of options.Plus,there are several web sites dedicated to digital photography,and they supply free downloads of Photoshop samples, such as "textures," and so on.Very helpful.
Get this if you can't spring for the complete Photoshop program. You will not be disappointed

I wanted to see if I could do all the essential digital image editing "on the cheap" in PSE5...and I am satisfied that I have been able to do just that.

The best companion book I've seen to assist in that effort is this one:
Adobe Photoshop Elements 5.0 Maximum Performance: Unleash the Hidden Performance of Elements by Mark Galer.
 
The combination of the PSE5 software and book proved to be perfect for me, and as near as I can tell, I can now do all the image editing I need to do, at a fraction of the cost and time required for the full-on Photoshop product. I'm very satisfied with my purchase. If you're on the fence about it, I'd recommend downloading the 30 day trial version from the Adobe website prior to purchasing

Good product; however, I don't understand why it requires lengthy updates 
every time I open the program.  

Perhaps they should try to get it right the first time.  And it's impossible to tell whether the updates do anything for me.

Using it with Quicken is a PITA.

It is unclear to me how you get more than one state

<review_text>
I had read a lot of reviews (here and elsewhere) warning of Final Cut's massive learning curve, and I do believe that helped soften the blow when I first tried this program. Because there definitely is a learning curve--this is far more complex than iMovie. But, the good news is, it's not beyond the newbie's reach!

I'm such a newbie with anything video, it's pitiful. I have only made two or three small movies in iMovie, and they weren't very sophisticated. I mostly just tinkered around. But, being the fool that I am, I decided that I wanted to get Final Cut Express to go along with the new camcorder I had just purchased.

Because I was prepared to have to re-learn (or struggle) at first with Final Cut, I had purchased a book (for version 2 of FCE, which was perfectly suitable). Armed with my book and limited expectations, I set about trying to make a fun little "music video" (using video clips and still pictures). Amazingly enough, I learned how to do the "Ken Burns Effect" with the pictures, make transitions from one clip to the next, edit the sound so that one track would predominate for part of the video, then fade out for other parts. And I was able to fix the video clips (zoom in, lighten, change aspect ratio). And then I added titles with LiveText. All this in the first two days of using Final Cut!  Sure, the little video I made was no award-winner, but it was actually a servicable, fun little project that I wasn't too ashamed to show my friends.

(Another thing about fixing the aspect ratio of one of the video clips--there was this one clip that seemed resistent to any tweaking or adjusting that I tried with it. I had used multiple programs to try to resize it to the correct dimensions, but something always went wrong. Either the picture quality degraded terribly, or else the corrected dimensions didn't "stick" and it bounced back to being distorted. Nothing worked--until Final Cut. I'm sure that other programs could have done the same thing, but I tried so many, and failed. So that was another thing that impressed me!)

I know there's a whole lot more to learn about Final Cut, and I certainly don't anticipate that I'll become a master at it. But it does offer *a lot* more flexibility than iMovie, and it is definitely a lot of fun. 

The right way to approach it is, I believe, to start small, expect baby steps at first, have fun, and GET A BOOK! A book is absolutely essential. If you are an impatient soul who expects perfection the first day, this is not the application for you. Because you learn to "do it manually," you have much more control--but it takes time to learn it all.

Oh, a note about hardware: I made my first little video on a 1.25 GHz G4 Mac Mini with 512 megs of RAM. It wasn't a speed demon by any means, but because my video was short (about 2 minutes), it really wasn't too painfully slow most of the time (except for rendering, but I guess that was going to be slow anyway). I have since upgraded the Mini to 1 GB of RAM, and *everything* is snappier, so I highly recommend it. But it's good to know that even a little Mac Mini with less-than-impressive RAM can work in FCE.

OK, it is big (4 CDRs).  And a full install will require over 2.35 GB.  But it loads quickly and offers nice greeting card variety along with pretty sophisticated card customization options on all pages of the card.  

As in previous years, it also installs Event Planner. If you don't want to use Event Planner you can stop it from starting with Windows by going to START / ALL PROGRAMS / Startup group and deleting the entry for Event Planner from the STARTUP group but if you don't have a similar program, you might find Event Planner to be useful.

I found setting up this program for my auto-duplexing Ricoh color laser printer easy enough to do, so setting it up for other printers will likely be pretty easy also. 

The quality of the printed cards is really astounding, even my normally "picky" wife thinks they look very nice and acceptable for any use. I suppose your results could depend on your printer but if your printer currently prints nice graphics and pictures, then the cards should turn out very nice. I recommend using heavy card stock for a professional looking final product. 

Cards that default to printing out in the 1/4 sheet size (four fold) format can easily be printed at 1/2 fold size and the graphics and text remain outstanding. 

I never experimented with the "partial install" that would require disk swapping but save HD space, so I cannot if that would be a nuisance or not.  

Overall, there is nothing I've found about the program that I don't like.

I have used WordPerfect and Quattro almost from their inception, so I have seen both of them improve over many years. Those years of practise have resulted in WordPerfect Office X3, a really outstanding product.

Because many other organizations and people that I work with use MS Word and MS Excel, in the past I have had no choice but to grudingly use them in response. Now, however, WordPerfect and QuatroPro can translate Word and Excel, incoming and outgoing. Therefore, I no longer have to maintain two Office programs. 

Many years of using WP Office have probably prejudiced me, but I find it more user friendly than MS Office; however, the biggest difference is that Corel is responsive and helpful whereas MS is almost impossible to deal with

I like WordPerfect much better than Microsoft Word as it is easier to use.  Reviel codes solves a lot of problems when text wont behave. Not available in Word. I bought the X3 version because of some bad bugs in ver 12., like not being able to export my address book without errors and mail merge problems. The price was right on Amazon and it was easier that trying to fix 12. I don't see a big difference between the two versions except that they fixed all the problems that I was having in 12. If an earlier version is working for you, I see no good reason to upgrade.

I installed it on three of my computers with no problem I have used wordperfect before and it's vey user friendly. I'm not a power user but the basic things seen be easier to do. I recomended. The software came with and intructional  dvd no how to used un like the microsoft counter part.
this software is more then what is needed for the average person. it also comes with some free download for installing the software in your computer which you can install on all three computers. it come with lots of template that you can used.
buy, buy, buy I say. lol is worth it

I've always preferred WordPerfect to Word.  I find it is easier to use, more intuitive, and allows more control over documents.  It is less buggy, and I have yet to find one thing that Word does better than WP.  This new version of WP is even better than the old, and I can use it more now because it seamlessly converts documents to and from Word.  

Word users should find this version especially easy to switch to, since it can be made to look and act like Word (though why anyone would want that, I don't know).  Underneath the surface, though, it is still WP, which means it is stable, you can see codes in your document and manipulate them, and it won't do things like decide when you put a number somewhere that you are making a list and start indenting and doing other weird things you don't want and can't control.  

I have been using WPX3 heavily since I got it, but I still haven't used all the features.  I am especially looking forward to trying its PDF conversion function.  I also haven't used any of the other programs in the suite yet, but if prior versions are any indicator, they will also be easy to use and powerful.

I've been using Wordperfect for about 25 years and it keeps getting better.  It is the best word processor by far.  So many things are better than Microsoft's word processors.  Importing graphics, mail labels, and especially reveal codes to name a few.

I remember the first time I used WordPerfect, and the first time I used Microsoft Word.  I couldn't imagine why anyone would choose the vastly inferior Word over WordPerfect.  

Years passed, and now I find myself using MS Word every day.  I'd been ground down by the thousands of Word users who'd picked it up along with PowerPoint and Excel, and who didn't have enough savvy to know how to convert documents from one format to another.  WordPerfect _always_ converted MSWord docs.  MSWord never reciprocated.  Shouldn't that have told them which program had a mandate to make the customer's life that much easier?  With each successive iteration, WordPerfect introduced some new innovation, and in the next incarnation, Microsoft aped it.  It got to the point where users would nod appreciatively at the innovation, then wait the inevitable year-long interval for Microsoft to catch up, and then they'd buy that.

Well, due to an outrageously fair price point and multiuser license, I tried WordPerfect X3, and it was like coming home.  It's nothing short of amazing.  I went out and bought a copy for my parents, and they love it, too.  Now my brother, an attorney, has asked me to buy him a copy, since so many of the federal prosecutors he works with have WordPerfect only, and can't seem to open his Word files.  The more things change, the more they stay the same

I find MS's Expression Web to be a huge step up for the professional web designer from FrontPage.  FrontPage 2003 was extremely nice and very usable by informal web developers, but the code view really wasn't much better than notepad (...not that I have a problem with notepad!).  [...]  I highly recommend it for the professional web designer

A good product but like a lot of Microsoft releases, not everyone outside of Microsoft is ready for it.  Check with your web hosting service first to be sure they support sites developed with Expression Web.  That is a problem I have run into.  In fact some hosting services that support Front Page, haven't even come to full support of Front Page 2003 let alone Expression Web. You could end up changing hosting services to take full advantage of this product and its features

Great product! I have had a little experience with FrontPage, but this product is definitely not FrontPage with a new look. This is an easy to use yet professionally powerful tool for web page development. It goes way beyond my abilities. If Microsoft continues to develop this product the way it has started....then watch out DreamWeaver

Compared to FrontPage and its infamous "bots", Expressions Web is a refreshing piece of software from Microsoft that out-DreamWeavers DreamWeaver.  As a long time DreamWeaver user, the ability to easily stay in design mode in Expressions Web while building your user interface without the incredible futz-factor that DreamWeaver imposes is its greatest strength. This is a very impressive, stable product that I plan to use a great deal in my non-.net web development work. It makes building and maintaining pure html web sites and newsletters much easier and more intuitive than ever

I have been using FrontPage 2003 and decided that Web Expression Web was the next stage in my website building hobby.  It was easy to install, and I can still use FrontPage 2003 on my existing websites. No need for FrontPage extensions which will be a plus on one of the server hosts I use.  Also bought "Using Microsoft Expression Web" by Jim Cheshire. An excellent book.  Still have much to learn, but looks like fun

This is the 3 copy version of Norton  AV.  (one CD will create three copies) I purchased it to save money as it was less than $20 per copy.  I bought it to replace NAV 2006 on the same three computers which had expired.

Installed easily on two machines.  Just the uninstall of 2006 and the install of 2007.   

The first machine was more difficult.   There is evidently some conflicting software on the computer as i had to use msconfig for a "Clean boot" per Norton web site instructions .  I kept running into the "blue screen of death" on the previous installs when i would get to the actual install of the Norton AV.  Each time i would have to uninstall the program and do more.   But all of the help came from the Symantec (norton) website.  It is now working fine.

Added:
My personal preference is to not use software firewalls.  I use a router with NAT as a hardware firewall. (It only blocks unauthorized incoming malware)  Software firewalls try to tell you about everything leaving your computer and generally you either become paranoid or just shut the thing off.   They are intended to look for malware by behavior.  Antivirus programs look for malware by signature.  The only advantage to finding malware by behavior is if the computer is attacked in the first day or two of the malware's existence.  If one has an antivirus program it will eventually (within a few days) find the problem that the software firewall was trying to tell someone about. (assuming they haven't given up yet with too many cries for wolf).
So the only software firewall i have (Microsoft OS firewall) is turned off and thus i haven't had the same problem as others report. 

As a practice i sent junk email directly to the trash can and avoid weird websites.  So far no problems with malware.

I do television editing for my church and I dabble alittle at home. I have many editing programs that I use for music and video editing of home movies from cams and 8mm.I had nero 6 and it was ok, but nero7 ultra (enhanced) has taken the place of all the other programs. It is my primary editing suite for music and videos. for music I can make changes to songs for skating programs where I would have to send out to have words removed or create a cd for pleasure.This program is remarkable, there are still somethings I have not yet used, this was the best but in this type of program for under $800.00 that is how much the programs that we use in the studio starting price is. Buying this program will be a great investment.

Nero 7 the original version was useless in that it prevented you from burning some things; mysteriously Nero had suddenly undone itself. All of that has now changed with the new update. It is so good that you can now burn ANYTHING on Vista.

Nero Inc also released a "Nero 7 cleantool" for removing bad installs. If you have had trouble with Nero 7 on Vista then the cleantool will fix it. Apply the tool. Clean install. 

Nero 7 is 99.9% effective but has a tendency to corrupt now again simply because it has a vast configuration system. Nero is a core burning tool. This means that several backup packages out there will actually find Nero on install and use it for burning. One example is DVDshrink that runs Nero in the background while backing up DVD movies on DVD-R. I/O errors with these programs, including DVD Decrypter, are usually the result of a configuration problem with Nero. One example is updating your firmware. Sometimes this requires you to reinstall Nero. This problem however is the only bug I have found with Nero. Just on the side - I highly recommend either Sony, Imation, Memorex, Verbatim as relatively cheap good second class media (80% or higher burn success rate). DVD is still in its early days of development and some media is garbage so don't blame Nero if you make coasters (half burned DVD-R Discs that are useless to you) with this software. I also recommend a healthy supply of at least 3 DVD-RW Discs for TESTING your burning so that you NEVER make a coaster and waste money. Okay, now back to Nero. 

Nero Burning Rom is the real tool in the bundle. It is the most configurable burning tool in the package while Nero Express is for those who do not know a thing about burning and works like a Wizard. A word of advice is to stick with the Rom and learn it without using the Wizard. You can choose from dozens of CD formats and dozens DVD formats, including several variations of each format. Image burning and hybrid discs of any time are all here. There is not a disc format you cannot burn with this program. Burner hardware based error correction systems in conjunction with the Nero software make a perfect burn almost every time. Nero also happens to be extremely fast, if not the fastest out there, however fast is also in terms of how fast your burner is, but the software package requires little to no processing before a 8GB DVD is being pulled onto your HD. You can create ISOs with Nero and even use Nero to open up ISOs so you can read the content). There is an amazing amount of free software out there that uses this burner as their base and rightly so. It is the best burning software out there at this time of writing. 

Pros: 

- If you can learn tutorials for all types of backups then this and a DVD burner will change your life if you play games and watch movies. 
- Solid performance. With good hardware and media almost flawless burns every time. 
- Nice configuration. Can even backup your PS and Xbox Games. 
- All burning formats. 
- About 266mb in size. 


Cons: 

- Let's face it. DVD burning and backup does have a bit of a learning curve. Read plenty of tutorials that use Nero to do specific backups. 
- Corrupts sometimes and needs cleaning before reinstall. 
- You really need a top of the range machine to backup a DVD in less than an hour

I previously had Nero 6 and it had tons of bugs for me. I upgraded to 7 ultra enhanced when I upgraded my computer to Vista premium, and I was pleasantly surprised. Everything I have tried so far has been flawless.
It seems that different systems have different results with Nero. For example some people say Nero 6 works best for them, but on my old system it was horrible (running on win2k).
It's complicated software though, so people should give Nero a break.
Overall they do a great job. Just download the trial first and see how it runs on your system.

The only downside is it's learning curve some features and options are complex, but once mastered you will be more then pleased with this product.

I used this unit to calibrate my Mitsubishi WD65732 DLP HD TV and was surprised at how good the picture looks after the adjustment. I first went through the tv manual to make sure I understood all the various adjustments the tv makes and wrote them down on a spreadsheet so I could study them and make sure I knew how the language related to the SpyderTV adjustment language. Once I did that and marked down the adjustment ranges, it was a breeze to run the software and make the adjustments. It even creates a pdf file at the conclusion for record purposes and future comparisons. Some of the adjustments for color temperature were surprising, but the bottom line is that the picture looks great

After going insane with the new version of Norton Systemworks 2005, which doesn't even install, I decided to finally swear off all Symantec products. 

I have used Zone Alarm Pro for some time. It's not perfect, but it certainly will protect your computer. I took the plunge and went with the full security suite this week, and I've been relatively happy.

On the plus side, the software works really well. The personal firewall is better than any you can find, and the virus protection found a phishing app that Norton had not (before I had unstalled it).

On the minus side, the firewall can be problematic. I've had page load issues on Ebay and on my own site which has a cgi script to keep my images and files from being hotlinked (bandwidth theft). When I visit my site or any other that has a similar anti-theft cgi script, the images simply won't come up. Ebay gets all messed up as well. I haven't been able to figure out a setting that works, so I have to turn off the firewall on Ebay and a few other sites, which kind of defeats the purpose of a firewall. This doesn't happen a lot though, so it's not annoying enough to get my dander up.

All in all it's been a far better investment than Symantec products, so despite its limitations I would recommend this program. It does have a lot of options to set, but they are pretty easy to get through if you are computer literate.

If you decide to go with this program and you currently have Norton Antivirus, you will need to uninstall Norton before this program will run.

If you were to ask me if I preferred Symantec Systemworks or Zone Alarm Security Suite, there would be absolutely no hesitation in recommending Zone Alarm.

Between high school and college I have studied French for three years and I had been convinced that I would starve to death in Paris trying to understand the menu and to then get myself understood.  Much of that has changed not that I am half way through the Rosetta Stone program.  My ear is now tuned to the language. I have a visceral feeling for the grammar and an ability to discern tenses.  My vocabulary still needs to get stronger, but now that I can distinguish individual words in a stream of French, that is only a matter of practice with the language.  As advertised, this program is painless and progress is rapid.  Try the demo, you'll see.

The immersion process is the only one that works, and this product is a first rate immerser, making the study painless, even immensely pleasurable as one realizes he/she is coming to "own" a new language and perspective. In working with students it is the best "head start" method that I know of, comparable to one-on-one study for at least a year with an accomplished tutor. Unlike less effective methods, it quickly achieves the essential purpose of deeply internalizing the language if one does each of the processes thoroughly. Of course continued study, especially in acquiring vocabulary, is necessary, just as it is for those acquiring a native language - the study of any language is ongoing.

I would give this program 50 stars if that option were available.

If you look at my review history, you may note that I've given very few five-star reviews. I save five stars for outstanding products. I believe Wordperfect X3 is best described as outstanding.

A long time ago, I used Word Perfect. However, my earlier jobs required I use MS Word, so I did my best to become a Word guru. I believe I accomplished that short of creating custom macros. As a law clerk, I started a new job where WordPerfect was the standard.

So, last year I bought WordPerfect 12. At first it was difficult, but I bought a book that helped me fill in the blanks. With the ability to customize keyboards and the fact that WordPerfect gives the author a great degree of control (especially with show-codes), I was soon able to become a WordPerfect guru. I remembered all the things I used to love about WordPerfect. Like any lover, I also learned to ignore some of the blimishes of WordPerfect. (One of those blemishes is the behavior of pushing a change from that point of the document forward, which, once you get accustomed to it, is really a nice feature.) Wordperfect and PDFs are the two accepted file formats for electronic submission to Federal courts.

There were two complaints I found at work among Word devotees: 1) the ability to export to PDF but not import and 2) the inability to cut from a Word document into a WordPerfect document without creating all the formatting litter Word likes to use.

1. We occasionally receive PDFs that we would have to retype to be able to make edits. With the ability to import PDFs (that is, those that were authored and exported into PDF, not documents scanned into PDF), we were now able to edit those PDFs. This was a real time saver. Since PDF is the de facto universal standard amongst all platforms (Windows, Mac, Unix), this was a great improvement.

2. Formatting litter is a real pain to deal with. I never could get a MS Word document to just import into WordPerfect without headaches in trying to fix the formatting. My solution was to copy the portion out of MS Word, paste into a text file, copy again and then paste into WordPerfect. My complaint was I could not just straight paste into WordPerfect. Well, Corel heard my cry and provided the ability to copy just the text. The lone MS Word holdout in my office capitulated with that. He has no more to complain about.

Another great thing about WordPerfect is the fact that the file format for its documents has not changed in years (I heard a WP rep say no change since 1995). Why should it? Everything you could want to do in a document (perhaps barring professional typesetting) can be done in WordPerfect. There's no need to create a new format when the one you have just works.

This product does exactly what those who have come to love WP expect it to do. I think Corel has done a good job of resolving my own personal quibbles with WP.

So, if you're looking for a solid performer that seeks to beat competition by improving itself, WPX3 is representative of what you're looking for

Overall I would highly recommend the Rosetta Stone software even though it's a bit over priced and certainly insufficient as your primary learning method.  Rosetta Stone *combined* with Pimsleur is a great method for languages that are similar to your native language.  The disks are copy protected and that is a serious drawback as you need the CD in the drive any time you are going to use it and you can't use a backup copy for safety.

The Rosetta Stone lessons are quick, easy and fun to do, thus encouraging usage.  If you can afford it I would definitely recommend combining Pimsleur and Rosetta Stone.  Both are excellent products and far better than less expensive products commonly available.  But neither alone is sufficient for effective learning of a language.

Could Rosetta Stone be improved?  Certainly.  More diverse and better graphics would help.  The graphics they use are very good but occasionally a picture isn't quite clear as to meaning.  For example if you are supposed to select "a boy on a horse" you may not realize it is a boy on the horse.

If you are questioning if you should get Rosetta Stone or not, just get a free demo CD from their website and try it yourself.  As far as I can tell the full product is exactly the same as the demo but obviously you have access to more lessons

I purchased this program about 1.5 years ago. I have been casually studying German through other programs for about 4 years. The best basic words-only is through Unforgettable Languages (very basic, but easy as heck to learn). Rosetta Stone is the best for understanding gender, verb usage and adapting to the German style of sentence structure. I absolutely love all the functionality and versatility of the program. It is incredibly challenging to go from reading to typing and to speaking. 
The only negative is that the CD has to be used to run the program. Even with an accelerated CD-Rom, the starting/stopping of the CD is distracting. If that feature were corrected, it would be perfect

This is actually a review for more than one product (Pimsleur and Rosetta Stone)

If you are willing to spend 1-2 years learning a foreign language but have limited time (weekly), lack the ability to immerse yourself in that culture for 1 year (the best way to learn the language), can't attend classes, can expend some budget, and want the process to be challenging yet fun, here's how to do it:

1. Buy a good English-Foreign Language Dictionary.
2. Get the Pimsleur Course for that language. (Check Ebay for used copies)
3. Buy the Rosetta Stone Program for that language. (Costly. Try the online monthly subscription option if your budget is tight.)
4. Get a Basic Grammar Language Book (Barron's highly recommended)

Putting it all together.

1. Listen to the Pimsleur Program during your daily commute-1 lesson per day. (Take the weekend off) DO NOT go to the next lesson until you have a 80% recall of the material. THERE IS NO NEED TO BE AT 100% RECALL before going to the next lesson. (Trust me on this on-avoid my pain)
      Using this method, you can get through ALL Pimsleur lessons (Levels I-III)in 1 year. THE FOCUS OF PIMSLEUR IS SPEAKING SKILLS.

2. At the same time, use the Rosetta Stone lessons on the weekend, with one 30 minute to 1 hour session. Go through the guided exercise followed by the test. THERE IS NO NEED TO GO THROUGH EVERY LESSON (TYPE) for each program. After you buy the product, you'll know what I'm talking about. THE FOCUS OF ROSETTA STONE IS LISTENING SKILLS.  

3. Review the basic grammar of the language as you go through the 2 above.

4. Contrary to what Pimsleur says, look up any words for spelling, and likewise, for Rosetta Stone, look up any words for definition you don't understand. 

Bottomline: Despite what they advertise, these are not stand-alone programs. Also the secret to recall is anticipation, meaning an 80% success rate for Pimsleur is ok and 70% success rate for Rosetta Stone is okay before moving to the next lesson. 

You don't get any extra points for making 100% and this effort can be counter-productive (burn out, boredom, and frustration before finishing the lessons.)

Your goal should be to get through all of the programs and lessons and the experience should be challenging and fun. Afterwards, you can take your trip to that country for the total immersion experience, and after the first 2 weeks, you'll see how well spent your time was with the programs.  

Note: I've used the Japanese, German, and Korean Pimsleur Courses, and Rosetta Stone German and Japanese Programs. I've also spent extensive time in all 3 of those countries. Learn from my mistakes.

Good luck and have fun.

Overall I was pleased with ease of installation. This was an upgrade from Office 2003. I backed up all files before upgrade, and always do this, but it was not necessary for this upgrade. My overall disappointment is Outlook's inability or difficulty to use other mail servers (yahoo, gmail, etc.). The shift appears to favor msn products only (hotmail and msn). No wonder Thunderbird is slowly becoming a favored email application

It seems the last few Office releases I have purchased haven't really offered anything different, but this one does.  The interface is totally changed and takes some getting used to.  I would suggest upgrading to Office 2007 when you have a little time to figure out the new layout and not if you have to jump right into a project.  The new toolbars seem to be really thought out and are very user friendly.  If you aren't into change and prefer the status quo of the standard, File Edit Tools...layout, then this product is not for you.  If you are willing to spend a couple hours getting used the new layout (it's quite easy) you won't be sorry because it's well worth it.

Office 2007 is a nice step up from Office 2003 (and earlier) as it has better visuals on the toolbar. e.g. Instead of just seeing the worded commands on the toolbar where one clicks on the command and then gets a drop down list to choose from with more commands, i.e. File, Tools, Edit, etc, you'll see tabs with different commands on the toolbar. When clicking on the tabs, it sets up across the toolbar, all of the functions of that particular tab. Once viewed, you not only see the words of the functions, but also, small example graphs and images of what that functions does. This only applies to all the applications other than Outlook, which pretty much retained the same look and feel as 2003

The load times seem to be much quicker than what I had in the 2003 version. In Outlook, setting up accounts, maintaining names and addresses is much easier too. The only annoying part of Office 2007 that comes to mind is, one can only choose from 3 color schemes. The three are "Black" which really looks more like a dark taupe or slate color, "Blue" which looks more like a light powder blue and "Silver", which looks like a light gray. In my honest opinion, I like having the standard color look like previous versions and as my taste goes with this, I only like the black setup only

I bought this for my god-daughter after buying Mia's Science Adventure. I have never been so impressed with a companies product before. You can learn both Spanish AND French on the same CD. The graphics are amazing, the adventure is stupendous and now Lily (my god-daughter) is learning Spanish. Her level is above all her classmates and she's even started conversing with a Mexican girl in our neighbourhood. Well worth your money

This game is great!  After buying Mia Reading I thought it was a great idea to get my 2 girls to start learning Spanish since we live in a global village. They game was easy to load, easy to navigate and the level was perfect for beginners. The high quality 3D animation will blow you away. Even my husband who learned 3D animation at the Vancouver Film School was blown away. The best part is, that they love playing it as they think it is a game. They forget they're learning numbers and vocab and how to put together simple sentences. Well recommended

I have had this only a couple of days and have learned it quickly thanks to the training CD that is included with the program.

Very easy to learn. Great item.

3/23/07,
I have used this program every day and must say I love it. I have used other photo editing software and did not like them much. This is so easy to use, the training CD gets you started and after compleing it (7 chapters) you are ready to fix all the photos you like but are over or under exposed. A powerful program. You can look like a pro using this. 10 stars if I could

Before purchasing this product I did the trial of Photoshop for 30 days and then the trial of this one.  Paint Shop Pro (PSP) won hands down!  While they both have similar features, the learning curve on Photoshop is ridiculous...PSP is so intuitive, you can figure out most of the features on your won, but the help feature is great...side by side help as you click through the menus and buttons.  I was impressed!  The red-eye fix is excellent and flexible, with ability to change to pet eye, different eye colors, WOW, there is just so much and all ready to use out of the box without any complicated aftermarket manuals needed.   I have restored some antique photos with very impressive results.  So far I have not had the instability issues that others cite, but my PC is heavy on the graphics capability and memory, perhaps that helps.

This photo editing software package is unreal.  It has more features and functions than you can shake a stick at.  Right out of the box I began some serious photo editing and got outstanding results.  Beats any other software in it's price range.  I have yet to read the manual or instructions as it intuitive.  Two things - don't even bother with the free version of Snapfire, which is included.  It is redundant with Pro Photo and rather simplistic without much value.  It is included as a teaser to get you to spend more money with Corel by way of an upgraded version.  And unfortunately the software is NOT well behaved and crashes to frequently.  If it were not for this stability issue I would have given it a (5) star rating.  Corel - nice job but get it working better

Like many other long term hobby digital photo fans I have used Paint Shop Pro for more than 10 years from version 4. It has always been a frustration that the programme was written for creating paint type graphics and photos were almost an add on. As Digital photography became more and more a real option the earlier versions of Paint Shop Pro became more of a frustration and I tried everything else. At last Corel Paint Shop Pro Photo feels like it was written for photo editing. It is easy to use with all the assistance a beginner could want, but dig deeper and it will go wherever you want to go, and more. I'm sad to see Paint Shop Album almost redundant, but it is great to have the organiser on tap. It runs on a less than optimal computer system unlike others that are too large and slow for many of us to consider.

I used Paint Shop Pro to help build my website. I really like it and I'm glad I bought it. My favorite part about it is the animation software. You can do great animation or cool banners or even little buttons with cool effects. Because of PSP 9 my website now has animation, buttons and a banner with bright colors and images! I love it! And anyone can use it! I had no experience with PSP or computer art and graphics, but this is pretty simple to use.

Also you can use PSP for touching up and doing other neat things with your photographs. This is great software for doing all this stuff and it's so much cheaper than Photoshop. If you're building a website and want to add color and graphics or if you want do to some photo touch up work, then maybe you want to check out Paint Shop Pro

This is truly the killer application for comic book collectors.  You get the comic's whole run from its auspicious origins in 1961 to its current incarnation at the end of 2004, in a tiny DVD that you can carry anywhere.  The thrill of reading classical issues in all their colored glory is not to be missed, particularly for those not reprinted so far.  I especially enjoyed the Impossible Man and Molecule Man origin stories.  Seeing how particular adventures ended is also great fun, since I owned some comics from the generally undistinguished 1980s, but didn't know how things turned out.  Being able to read the entire John Byrne run of the mid-eighties was spectacular.  It's even better than his work at the X-Men, and almost as cool as the Lee-Kirby years.  This is so much better than the Essentials, since it's in color and so much cheaper, plus it includes the original ads and letter pages.  It also beats the Masterworks series not only on account of price, but also because it has the original colors.  It's as good as owning the complete collection, but it will take up less space and hence will generate less nagging from mothers or wives.  This is a must have item, with perhaps the best price/quality ratio I have ever seen.  Can it be improved?  Sure.  Why not take advantage of the possibilities of computers and create an index of all characters that would allow the reader to see all appearances of a character over the years? Why not create an index of writers and artists, so that one may quickly get a view of their work?  Cross-referencing is the next step the good people at Marvel must be working on.  But there's no reason to wait for that.  Even as it is, this DVD is not just good enough.  It is great, like the Fantastic Four themselves

This is absolutely tremendous!  If you ever owned the original Kirby-Lee Fantastic Four comics, and let them go for whatever reasons, or if you never had them, and want to see the World's Greatest Comic Magazine in the days when it truly lived up to that title, this is the way to go!  No one who's gotten this far should pass it up... it's an unbelievable bargain and a wonderful item in these days of madness like comics slabbed in plastic, like Han Solo trapped in carbonite...

Forget the Marvel Masterworks volumes... the reproduction ranges from shoddy to terrible, and the color is garish.  Those reprints do a great disservice to these classic comics... the originals looked much better than they do in the Masterworks volumes!  An example... Fantastic Four #5... in the Masterworks volume, on the very first page of the very first appearance of Doctor Doom, black splotches inexplicably obliterate most of Doom's mask...there's no excuse for that! That wasn't there in the original, and it's not here in the scan!  

If you don't own the original comics, and aren't wealthy enough to buy the originals, this is the way to go.  The scans are very good, high resolution.  Here, you see all the linework that gets clotted in the Masterworks volumes, and you can zoom in and really study all the details of that great Kirby machinery, otherworldly architecture, and cosmic panoramas!  I've had a big grin on my face from the moment I looked at the first page... this is what comics are all about... pure, unadulterated, cosmic fun!

The original letter pages and ads are a real treat, too... the whole experience is time travel!

Oh, yeah... you also get 34 years of non-Kirby Fantastic Four issues... ;-)

Please note!  If you have a Mac, and are having difficulties with this dvd, here are some tips.

Are you opening it with Preview?  If you just click on the icon on the disk, it will open in Preview... but this will not work properly.  You must use Adobe Reader to see the pages without the watermark.

Install Adobe Reader from the dvd.
Make an alias of Adobe Reader and put it in the Dock.
Click and open the dvd icon.
Click and open the decade folder.
Don't open the year folder... click and drag the pdf icon, (such as FF_1960.pdf), onto the Reader alias in the dock to open.
Click on year.
Click on month.
Click on the magnifing glass icon to zoom to any size.
Enjoy all that cool Kirby machinery bigger than you've ever seen it!

I hope this is helpful

Snapfire and Snapfire Plus are new photo software from Corel. Snapfire was recently released as a free download and Snapfire Plus is a budget priced upgrade which adds more advanced features.

The one thing consumers ask for the most is a photo software that is easy to learn and use. Corel's answer is Snapfire's Message Center. From this one window, you can keep up with the latest news, updates and specials. More importantly, you have easy access to many tips and tutorials.

Snapfire has automated photo downloading from your camera, memory card or CD. Just plug in one of these and the Photo Downloader automatically starts. You can set download options for how it works. Snapfire will automatically rotate your photos when needed, check for and download only the photos added since the last download and automatically delete the photos from your camera after downloading them to the folder of your choice on your hard drive.

Once your photos are downloaded, you can use Quick Review to view photos in full screen mode and use the floating toolbar for tasks such as adding photo information, ratings and captions or starting Photo Fix. Snapfire's Photo Doctor analyzes your photos and makes suggestions for Quick Fix. With Photo Fix, you can pan, zoom and make corrections such as brightness, contrast and focus. Other photo adjustment features, which are similar to those included in Corel's popular Paint Shop Pro, include Fix Red Eye, Rotate and Crop (with a floating toolbar). Other features borrowed from Paint Shop Pro include easy-to-use organizing with Sort by, Search and Calendar Search. Snapfire also has ways to enhance your photos including Black & White and Sepia color effects.

The Photo Tray is a really nice feature which you can use to drag and drop your photos into a common location, grouping them together for a project, emailing to family and friends or printing. Snapfire has a really cool and special way to email photos. Its called Snapfire Show. After you select the photos you wish to send, Snapfire will automatically create a slide-show with built-in transitions, music and motion effects. Your photos are resized and embedded into the body of the email or added as an attachment.

Printing your photos is easy and fool-proof with the built-in layouts including standard 4 x 6, 5 x 7, 8 x 10, 3.5 x 5, wallet size and contact sheets. Snapfire will automatically use your default printer settings or you can change the settings or printer as needed. If you choose to order prints online instead, you can do so with one click of your mouse and the Photo Upload dialog box.

You can also use Snapfire to work with your videos. Just click on a video's thumbnail to view and edit the video in full screen mode. You can even grab a frame from your video and convert it into a photo. For crafters, Snapfire has several built-in project templates for album pages, greeting cards, calendars and collages. Creating a project is as easy as dragging your photos onto the template and using the basic tools to make adjustments, add text captions and position photos.

A trial version of Snapfire Plus (SE) comes packaged with the newest upgrade of Paint Shop Pro Photo XI or can be downloaded from the Corel website

It is user friendly, transparent, and more robust than Trendmicro's or CA's products, both of which slowed my computer and prevented my music websites from working.  For Windows OSes, Onecare is best in my experience.  However, I have not used OneCare's backup feature enough to make  a judgement.  The $49.99 for 3 computers may be okay, but it would be even better if Microsoft offers it for one computer at  1/3 the rate, say at $17/computer per year

wow, this really made a difference in my ability to create professional-looking comics. i have a graphics tablet and the drawing feel is  really good. i think my favorite feature is the tool for making Panels. Plus the tool for doing special effects lines, which is pretty sweet.

i just draw comics for fun, and for this price it is totally worth it. Manga Studio is perfect for publishing a webcomic or adding effects to existing drawings.

I would definitely recommend this software if you like to draw comics or manga

I purchased the mangadebut because i wanted to dabble in tones and inking (which I usually never do, usually I just scan in the sketch and then darken it with a photo editing.) I came to find out that using lines and erasing the sketch makes for a much more clean finished product. Of course, you could acomplish this with MS Paint if you really wanted to. 
One of the main (and only, in my opinion) advantages to this program is the amazingly vast variations of tones available to make your art more interesting. that alone makes it worth the 50 dollars you put into it.

One downside is that this program, because of it's many tones, uses and requires quite a bit of space. When I uploaded it on my laptop,it slowed down significantly. So much so that now I load it when I want to finish a nice drawing and the delete it from the computer again! XD

overall it deserves about 3-4 stars. ^.^

Creating Keepsakes Scrapbook Designer Version 2 Deluxe - This seems to be a nice program, but I have not found much use for it as of yet.  My intention, when buying it, was to use it for scrapbooking but also greeting cards.  I am sure that I will use it in the future as the program has nice graphics and is easy to navigate.  Broederbund products are usually very user friendly

I've been using Acrobat Pro since version 3.0.  This is by far the best user interface of any version.  Also like the new tool to combine multiple files into a single PDF.  No support for Office 2007 docs yet, but I understand from Adobe there will be a free patch soon

I've used PaperPort 9 for about 3 years, currently running under Win XP. I love it, my wife loves it, I have bought it for my kids, and recommend it to others. A lawyer friend of mine raves about it. I've had no problems with it. (I had to  downlaod and install an upgrade, but more recent production probably has the upgrade already incorporated.) I download bank and credit card statements and other documents to it from the Internet; I store faxed documents in it; I scan checks before I deposit them; I use it to convert documents to pdf so I can e-mail them. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I wish it were more convenient to do a couple of things; maybe V. 10 adds those features, but for the money, V.9 is a bargain. I just wish I had a faster scanner (what do you expect for $60?) so I could get rid of more paper documents. Highly recommended as a start toward the paperless office

It's amazing having the entire history of a comic series at your disposal.  In print format, it would be impossible for most people to own, let alone store, this much comic book history.  You have to adjust to looking at the comics on the screen, rather than holding it in your hands (a large monitor helps), but other than that I highly recommend this entire series of digitized comics.

To be able to go back in time and see how the comics reflect the times, whether they be in the 60's, 70's or more recent years, really shows you how closely comic books reflect pop culture

If you have a Mac, and are having difficulties with this dvd, here are some tips.

Are you opening it with Preview?  If you just click on the icon on the disk, it will open in Preview... but this will not work properly.  You must use Adobe Reader to see the pages without the watermark.

Install Adobe Reader from the dvd.
Make an alias of Adobe Reader and put it in the Dock.
Click and open the dvd icon.
Click and open the decade folder.
Don't open the year folder... click and drag the pdf icon, (such as FF_1960.pdf... I have the Fantastic Four dvd, so substitute whatever is appropriate), onto the Reader alias in the dock to open.
Click on year.
Click on month.
Click on the magnifing glass icon to zoom to any size.

I hope this is helpful

When I was a kid, I religiously read many of the Marvel comics. The Avengers was one of my favorites. In my dreams I would have loved to have read all of the issues, but the expense would have been (WAY) too much. Now, after so many years the opportunity is finally here. I was afraid that my youth would be too far removed to enjoy reading these anymore, but I took a chance and bought this DVD anyway. It was worth it - by a mile. I am enjoying reading each and every issue since the famed #1 as much as I would have as a kid. It will take a long time to get through them all, but I'll enjoy every minute. Stan Lee, thank you for such a simple pleasure. Great stuff for kids of all ages

Ok I gave it 4 stars just for the fact that you cant actually hold them in your hands and read them . I do have them on my laptop so I guess that kinda works. Whats great about it is the price. 30 bucks for 40 years of comics.....get real!!! I did have some install problems at first like others have but when I took the disc out and reloaded it it fixed itself. I think it was a Adobe update but it did it for me so no biggie. My only problem now is when am I going to find time to read all of the issues. Oh and one more thing you can save the disc to your hard drive so you can save it at work and read at lunch without having to bring the disc with you. Highly recomended if you love comics

We bought it 1 month ago to help my almost 6 year's old sun to learn how to play because I didn't know how to play and I couldn't teach him. As a result of this purchase 

1) My sun fall in love with chess and become so good player that I couldn't imagine

2) I (his mom) learned how to play too.
It is so much fun to learn it that I would recommend it to anybody. It worth it every penny I spent. I like everything about this game. Kids will love it 100%.

We purchased this for my 6 year old son and 7 year old daughter since both children have been asking me to help teach them how to play chess the last several months.  While I have been able to get them started, I find that approach used in this software to introduce the game pieces and concepts has allowed their understanding of the game to grow.

Both kids enjoy using this software and, if I would let them, would spend hours at a time using the software.

My biggest issue with the software is the  sound and animation.  We continually have issues with the sound/animation not being in sync or the audio cutting in and out.  We run this on a computer with plenty of processing power, memory, disk space, etc.  It does not bother this kids too much, but I find it annoying.

All in all, a great tool to help my children learn the game.

This is my first review but I just felt compelled to tell everyone about this terrific program. I bought this game when my children were in Kindergarten and second grade. Fritz and Chester's program is so engaging. There are rhymes and chants for each piece's moves as well as for some other "strategy-type" moves. For example, "A knight on the rim is ugly and dim." What a great way to teach kids to keep their knights in-play! This program teaches kids how pieces move and some simple strategies. I would recommend getting Fritz and Chester 2 now since you are going to get it after your kids learn to play! My boys both joined chess teams when they were in first and third grade. Their use of this computer game gave them the advantage to win several chess games in tournaments. Fritz and Chester 2 is also great and my boys, now in third and sixth grade, still play it

This software is focused on learning the rules of the game.  Movement of different pieces and pawns is demonstrated through an assortment of arcade-type games.  There are some decent books for learning chess for beginners, but learning through a computer game program makes it much easier and more fun.

The program doesn't contain any instructions,so some people may find it frustrating figuring out what to do in the beginning. However, there is a symbol in the top right corner, clicking on which brings down the menu at which point navigating becomes a piece of cake.

Just knowing the rules of the game enables one to play chess, but not exactly to win, so the second CD in this series (Learn to Play Chess 2) continues where the first one left off and goes into different tactics and strategies.  

The software is recommended for 8 year-old children and older - kids at heart may have fun learning chess with this program also

Registry mechanic is a great registry tool.  It works better than the registry tools included with Symantec System Works.  If you purchase this version at 5.1 you can get a free upgrade to the latest version 6.0 once you register the product.  Try the evaluation and you will see how many registry errors your machine may have that can effect its performance

I bought the datapilot universal pro kit recently and it worked great! My screen broke on my nokia 6102, and i ended up buying a razor. I had some really important numbers on that phone and this program really saved me. Transferred all my numbers from my broken one into my new razor in a couple of minutes. Also, the image editor and the ringtone thingy came in very useful for saving images and sending mp3s to my phone.

The software is easy to install and easy to use.  The "import prior year's return" feature saved time in completing multiple returns .  I completed one return in 10 mins because of this feature. I also discovered the "save as PDF" feature that made it easier to send tax returns to family and friends whom I prepare returns.  I have used tax cut for the last 4 years and it gets better with each year. The premium federal is great for multiple returns with all kinds of schedules

This Bible is wonderful! It's written in language that is easy to understand. Many people give up on trying to study the Bible because the language is so different from the way we speak now. You won't have that problem with the New Living Translation, and the notes are so helpful. Whenever I'm unclear about a verse or the context, I check the notes, and usually they help me to understand the meaning. They also help me to understand traditions of the time and meanings that were implied to the readers of the time. Whether you've been a Christian for 50 years, or you're only thinking of trying to read the Bible for the first time, or you're anywhere in between, this Bible is a great choice

I'm just learning, and this bible is wonderful. It's written in language I can understand (much easier than the King James version), and the commentary brings everything into focus. 
There is so much extra information in this book and the commenters really took care to try to explain so a newbie like me could understand.
The book comes with a concordence also, which is a God-send (sorry about the pun). I've been so engrossed in reading that I haven't even looked at the CD-ROM yet, but I'm sure it will have great information also.
If you want an easy-to-read bible that comes with fantastic study material, this is the right book for you

This is a well done operating system I use the 64bit version and all but just a few of my software titles work without any problems. All my hardware has 64bit drivers. Overall this is a good product and I would buy it again. Because I went from a 32bit O/S to a 64bit O/S I had to boot from the DVD to install it, but I was able to install it using the key without any problems nor did I have to reinstall it afterwards as some website suggest you have to do

I don't know what other people are complaining about. I just installed Vista Ultimate a few days ago and I absolutely love it. No interface lag or any other lag at all. Maybe the people complaining have weak or outdated hardware. Those people need to turn down their settings if their not going to keep their computers on the cutting edge or at least near it. I'm glad Microsoft isn't waiting for people to catch up and are on the cutting edge. I'd rather be the one catching up than the other way around.

I have a Core 2 Duo e6300 overclocked to 2.5Ghz, 2 gigs of ram, a Geforce 7600gt and a Western Digital Raptor 150g HD and Vista Ultimate works flawlessly on my computer. It's not the best computer but it runs flawlessly, I built it myself and all the parts cost me about $850 off the net. I play World of Warcraft among some other games and I haven't seen any problems yet with any games or any of the major software I use as of yet. I've only encountered one problem and that was with my old Soundblaster Live! 5.1 sound card which has discontinued support. No big deal, it was about time to get a better one anyway. Vista is awesome, I love everything about it. It's very futuristic and it is not a simple interface makeover at all like some clueless dummies proclaim.

By the way, I only paid $110 for Vista Ultimate Upgrade off eBay, check there first if you already have an existing OS and want to save some dough

I use Microsoft Streets and Trips 2007 in a laptop computer for navigational assistance anytime I'm traveling to a destination where I'm not absolutely certain how to get there.  In general, I'm pleased with it's performance.  It has saved me from wrong turns many times.  However, the data seems to be as much as five years out of date on many street additions.  GPS tracking on country roads is inaccurate enough to cause constant "Off Route" - "Back on Route" messages as you navigate twists and turns.  I suspect, in that case,  the map data is just not that accurate

Don't listen to the whinnier. If you are serious about improving your focus and memory skills, this helps. You must use this program for 15 minutes everyday or you will be wasting your time and money. It is worth the effort! I noticed immediate results of being able to retain more info and having more focus at work. I also purchased the music CD's produced by the same company. They are helpful as well. I use them at work, at home, and in the car. The Brain Builder Booklet mentions the CD's. If you want to stop looking stupid because you can't remember information or you're tired of getting lost while driving, this will help you

I don't write reviews often but this product is so great I had to share my thoughts on it.  I bought this product because I was going back to graduate school(mechanical engineering so please excuse my grammar) and I wanted an extra boost in brain power.  I have been using this product just about everyday for weeks now and the results are very apparent.  I have noticed two obvious improvements in myself.  

First, I can now navigate a city with ease.  I always knew my short term memory was the limiting factor in my navigation abilities.  Before I'd always forget where I came from, left or right,what street Im on, etc.  I always had people correct me.  Now I am the one leading and its not because I am paying more attention.  Without directly thinking of my orientation I just know where to orient myself(My gf would always correct me, but now Im correcting her).   

The second obvious improvement is my improved speech and listening abilities.  I'd always have trouble fumbling in my speech and understanding people.  But now I feel I can think of what to say more quickly and clearly.  

I have been doing many puzzles this past summer and the combination of that and brain builder really changed my life.  I think more clearly and I can think "better" now. Hard to explain but the "fog has been lifted".  Everything is easier now whether its putting something together or understanding the environment around me.  Also my IQ scores appear to shoot up really high but thats up to debate.   

I just want to say what a great product this is and I highly recommend it to anyone.  Im sure when I start school this fall I'll see a leap in my abilities.

Brain Builder is a series of visual and auditory exercises aimed at improving attention, concentration and memory. This consists of seven exercises, one involving visual reaction speed and accuracy and six memorizing a sting of randomly generated numbers presented audiably or visually in one of three modes--BASE (straightforward) REVERSE (you must give back the string in reverse the order given) and FLASH (visual numbers presented one at a time instead of all at once like BASE) or RANDOM (auditory where you cope with numbers being read at an uneven pace). You are then immediately tested by having to type in what those were. There is no time limit on response. You progress to higher levels--which means memorizing more numbers faster during the viewing or listening--from an initially determined baseline test taken when first starting. Different voices--men, women, adults, and children--read the auditory presentations.  All and all, I found it to be fairly sophisticated and the exercises do seem help even beyond matters of number memorization. The primary shortcoming seemed to be the lack of feedback or coaching other than telling you not to get discouraged and to keep working hard.  Also, the progress summeraries (bar graphs) fail to take into account the higher levels for scoring purposes so day to day comparison of results seems too flat. Overall, I have enjoyed the program and have stuck with it although there are some days I wish for more variety and to do something else than just repeat numbers. What they say about only having to practice about 10 minutes a day--well--I've had to spend more like 30 minutes or more to do enough exercises to feel satisfied with my progress

I've been a Photoshop user since Version 3 and this upgrade is worth every penny.  I upgraded from version 7 and CS2 is clearly a step up.  Upgrading was a no-brainer.  The only negative is Adobe Bridge - I prefer the file browser that PS 7 had but I can live with it.

The floating image windows is also a nice touch - you are no longer confined to the PS main window.

All of my add-ons worked perfectly including FITS Liberator and the PTLENS suite

This upgrade installed easily with my Photoshop 5.5.  No problems at all.  This is an excellent program and leap years ahead of my Photoshop 5.5.  This is a much less expensive way to upgrade to cs2..rather than purchasing CS2 outright.

Be sure to get the updates after you install the program.

Great improvement in Photoshop technology.  I've greatly improved my ability to process astrophotography.  It's now much easier to make the same changes to multiple images of the same celestial object.  Greatly reducing the time required to process multiple images for stacking, aligning and combining.

This is a very good racing simulator!  But it's no arcade game so if you want to jump into a car and race around with little or no practice this is not the game for you!

It will take you time to perfect the driving skills and learn the handling characteristics of the various cars.  You're going to need a good wheel and pedal combo to get the most of this game.

Graphics are very good, but the race car physics and handling are exceptional.

Highly recommended for racing sim fans, not recommended for the casual race game player

This is the most technically excellent racing sim I have played. The physics are perfect, the graphics are pleasing, and there is a wide variety of tracks and cars. The learning curve can be very steep, but you can adjust the AI to suit your needs. You can also turn on traction control, steering aids, etc., which will get you into the game faster. After a couple months, you'll be good enough to turn these aids off and drive the cars the way they are meant to be driven. There is also a comprehensive driving school which will train you in the basics of racing. If you want a realistic racer, buy this game

Bought this after thoroughly enjoying GT Legends.  If you want to experience the best driving SIM on the market, buy GTR2.  While I love rally, sprints, NASCAR and most other driving games, this one sits on the pole.  Complexity level and your own personal motivation to get better keeps it from getting mundane. Graphics rock.  Get your system up to speed as all these other review suggest and that means a good wheel/pedal combo as well. How good is it?  I've had it several months and I still say it is the best there is.  Semper Fi

This 'game' is awesome, if you like SIMs...  

Do not buy this if your goal is to enjoy a leisurely drive once in 
a while.  'Playing' it is hard work and requires your full concentration.
Great tutorials to teach you how to drive on a track (it is *very*
different from taking the family car for a spin).

I got it with my Logitech G25 (an AWESOME FFB wheel).  I think these
two were made for each other.

I currently have version 1.0 on my pc. It does everything it claims to and does it flawlessly. It cleans internet cache, history, cookies and more! I've tried another internet privacy program, but it failed to clean up the tracks that this program successfully cleaned. I especially like the fact that it cleans the autocomplete entries in my internet search and internet browser. Others can use my pc, and won't be able to see what documents I've recently opened, which programs I've recently run, or what I've searched for and what sites I've visited online. And that's the way it should be! This program can be set to clean up this information securely (can be set to wipe not just delete the info). Another plus, it can clean usage tracks for all users on a pc. The program I tried on my other pc only worked with administrator accounts (and not very well may I ad)

I've been using this product for awhile, and I'm delighted with it. I got my Algebra I Homework done in 1/5 the time it usually takes me! In addition to this, when I feel like learning, I watch some of the Discovery Channel videos that are included with this. Even better is that this product comes with a $[...], reducing its overall price to $[...]. Today I'm going to use it to help me write a five paragraph essay.

I love Microsoft Student with Encarta Premium 2007, and you will too! Buy it! Trust me, you WON'T be disappointed

I wish the reviewer had stated whether MS Office 2003 Small Business Edition satisfies the requirement. Pending clarification, I'll stick with Encarta 2006 despite its less (than 2005 version) user friendly search page.
Encarta is an amazing product for kids of all ages and I'm more than willing to predict that 2007 is worthy of 5 stars

This product is a masterpiece.  It's a testimony to early 21st century thinking about the world, the earth, learning, and software.  It's a Swiss-Army knife of information with a kind of practical beauty that we associate with tools that work. Check out the map tool, and the view of the Earth at night.  It's delight and a gift to an active mind.

Somebody has thought long and hard about what students need on their computer to succeed.  What they've come up with is an awesome collection of innovative productivity tools for kids.

Take math. The math tool alone is worth the price of admission. This is where algebra class should start.  Math lovers will eat it up. For the less than loving, Student includes really excellent tutorials on math concepts.  It even links homework help for many of the major math books.  You put in the textbook, the assignment, and it steps the student through the problems.

Homeschooling? Read no further.  Just buy it.  

Geography? The map tool, especially the statistical mapper lets you view the world from outer space, with or without political boundaries, and compares the performance of countries on a zillion measures.  Literature?  It's got summaries and readers guides for a huge list of required reading, and not just the stuffy Victorian novels, but Ursula LeGuin and even some titles that I didn't think were worth reading.  The language tools -- you can hear a word pronounced in a surprising array of foreign languages,plus dictionaries and translators, and even plugins for MS Word that make it easy to write in French or Spanish.  No more funny key combos to get a cedilla.

Plus Encarta encyclopedia -- which is safer and way more effective at leading kids to track down related ideas than a web search. 

I'm sure I'm leaving something out.

The only problem is, it takes gigabytes of memory and really ought to be partnered with MS Office.  That said, if you take education seriously, you ought to have this on your computer

I initially purchased Creator 9 to do the same thing this software does, but the only thing is it didnt hang my computer when it came down to burn the DVD.  This software is pretty much easy to use, comes with two (Bibles) manuals, plenty of information in there to creat some good videos.  I recommend buying this or you can always buy Creator 9 have it crash your system and then spend a few days trying to review other products out there that have gotten good reviews such as this one. You will be happy with the videos you make. You can make a video containing still images (pictures), video from camcorder camera or from your computer, add text in the movies, add background music, its awesome.  I must say again it wont hang your system. Please get it, your family and yourself wont be disappointed.

Our photo and video editing softwares were both very basic and "old", so we decided to upgrade a couple of months ago.  After reading many reviews on different bundles, we decided to get the Adobe Photoshop Elements 5.0 Premiere Elements 3.0 bundle.  We've played around with the Premiere Elements a bit, and it's really awesome.  Much better than the Pinnacle Studio 8 we had before.  All the basic functions are easy to use and very intuitive, though we haven't gone and figured out the more advanced features yet.  The Photoshop Elements is a wonderful tool, as well.  We recently had to scan in a lot of old pictures (as in 20+ year old b/w photographs).  They needed a lot of touching up, and Elements 5.0 worked wonderfully for that.  I could adjust the lighting and sharpening, fix the colors and scratches, and the pictures turned out amazing.  You'd never be able to tell they were scanned images from such old photographs.  The program is also very intuitive.  I could do all the things I wanted to do without having to read the manual.  Of course, I'm still just touching on the surface of what all is possible, and I plan on reading the manual and studying the program in more detail once I have the time to do so, but for what I need right now, it's easy to use and does a good job.  There are only two things I have to comment on that I don't like about the Adobe bundle, and they are the reason why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5.
1. The stated minimum requirements for this bundle are 512MB RAM.  That's what we had on our computer, and while the program worked, it was so painfully slow that it wasn't feasible to really use it.  We ended up upgrading to 1GB, and it's been working great since.  So if you have less than 1GB RAM, make sure you upgrade before getting this software!
2. The red-eye fix in Photoshop Elements, or lack thereof.  There is an auto red-eye fix, but it doesn't work very well.  It finds red eyes in all kinds of places, just not where they actually are.  Sometimes it covers half the face, sometimes only half of the eye, etc. etc. etc.  There is an option to manually show the program where the red eye is, but it still doesn't work right.  Maybe there's another trick I haven't found out about yet, but as of right now, I usually give the fix tool a shot, and if it doesn't work I take the picture back into my old editing software and fix the red eye there.  I'm really very disappointed with this, as fixing red eyes is something you have to do quite frequently when editing pictures.  
Overall, the software has been very easy and fun to work with, even for an amateur like me.  :o)  If Adobe can adjust the minimum requirements recommendation and fix the red-eye fix tool, it's going to definitely deserve 5 points

TaxCut has been very reliable information and easy to use when preparing your taxes.  I have used it over the past several years.  Updates are easy to download and the software is great.  This year the software arrived on a USB key.  This is the easiest and best way to obtain the software.  Small, easy to store and is reusable.  I will continue to use TaxCut in the future

H&R Block 2006 works well like it always has. I've used and liked H&R since the Turbotax activation debacle, to the extent that I can like doing income tax! What is great is the media the software comes on. Install the program and then have a nice flash drive to use elsewhere. Maybe flash drives will be like floppies someday, with piles of used drives in a box, but for now it's a super handy way to store and move a few files. 256 megs makes for a big floppy but a small flash drive. No matter--the price it right

I bought this program for my 11 yr old granddaughter and she has very quickly learned the keyboard. I wanted her to learn the correct way to type before she developed bad hunt and peck habits. So much homework now requires typed reports. She had fun with it. It's a great program!

I bought this for my four girls.  they all love it, ad are learning lots.  but the quality of the graphics, characters, and even theme (or story) seem to be low budget.  We have a lot of other educational computer games which are just fun for even me to watch (and play).  The overall quality in our other games is much higher.  It is a lot like comparing Disney cartoons to Speed Racer.
BUT...my oldest, who is 11, still enjoys this program and has not complained about anything I write about here

I got this software from Office max. which is on sale for $8 on last week.
My 6 year old kid, start learning typing and he keep saying he want to type all the time.

Pros:
Settings are awesome. 
You can choose two types of keyboards
You can choose your words per min speed and many other aspects
You can choose 4 different musics or do not have any.
You can choose the difficulty levels.
Games and encouraging things for kids.

Cons:
Still needs to find one.

How does it matter about cartoon chars speaking to you, 
Adult can also learn from this CD, just by skipping cartoon talk.

I bought this title because the first Typing Instructor For Kids got such good reviews.  I was looking for a way to teach my 8yo son keyboarding.  He has always had a terrible time with handwriting.  I knew I needed really easy, slow-paced typing instruction for him, or he wouldn't get it.

Well, it's 6 months later and he can now type!  We did it with nothing but this software.  I made him practice about 10 min/day 5 - 7 days/week.  All in all, he found it to be work to learn this new skill, but still rather enjoyable.

There are 11 games included and several of them are very good -- meaning they are really fun AND build typing skills at the same time.  There is also a series of drills, lessons, and typing tests to teach the keyboard.  The keyboard is introducted a few keys at a time, and then you repeat the related drills, lessons, tests, and games until those keys are learned fairly well.  I had to require my son to keep repeating each section of the keyboard until he could do it at 15 wpm before letting him go to the next section.  This is what the software recommends, but I had to learn it the hard way.  At first, I let my son go ahead too fast and he ended up getting overwhelmed.  I ended up having to put a sticker chart on the wall and offering him prizes for getting to 15 wpm on each section.

I would recommend this software for children from 6 to about 11.  The cartoon characters are very juvenile and would probably offend a child any older than that.  However, for any adolescent or adult able to ignore the juvenile cartoons, this would be an excellent way to learn to type too.  I found that my typing skills improved just by occasionally using this software.

I just bought this thru Best Buy - could have got a better deal thru Amazon - oh well.  This product is amazing and very user friendly.  I really love the fact that it comes with its very own manual not a help guide you can print out yourself wasting all your paper.  It does everything - the props are very realistic, the shapes & edges so cool.  I have filled in very dark pictures using the watercolor feauture and made poor pictures look like works of art.  Not to mention that I can create my own photomontages, collages, & very unique artistic scrapbook pages.  It took me an hour to scrapbook an amazing page including fixing up photos. I will never spend money on scrapbook pages again!   So much fun!!

I recently wrote a review for this item due to a launching issue. Very angry, I made numerous calls and emails to Nova. At last I was able to converse with a rep who was more than helpful and made right with all my issues. I am pleased with my outcome with Nova and the response, making sure I was a satisfied customer.  I only rate this 4 stars as I am just now using the program and am very excited with what I've been able to accomplish in the past 3 days.  Thank you Nova for your help

I really enjoy using this program, much better than what was out there 5 - 10 years ago when I last worked on genealogy.  I love the Ancestry.com feature, it is wonderful to go find your grandparents, great-grandparents and even great-great grandparents in the US Census.  I have found out a few things that I didn't know, unfortunately my Mother recently passed away, and I have no one to verify some of it with.  I would suggest that anyone contemplating this program gets it now, and starts working while you still have elders who can help you sort through the information you find.  I also found a family tree out there from someone who only lives a few blocks from where we used to live.  She has traced her family back to the 1500's in Germany...and it appears that they are related to us.  It was strange to go to her website and find a picture of my Great Grandparents headstone.  It was just another branch of the family.  Buy it

This is a really great bargain.  The spreadsheets are easy to use with built-in formulas just like excel, instead of paying hundreds of dollars.  This was better than I expected for the money.  Excellent product, would highly recommend it for any home business, small business or everyday budgets, events and home bookkeeping.  This is a 5 Star program

This recommended software is easy to load, except for online requirements to update the files due to changes in the documents from the time of publication/software release.  The files for download was large and took a long time on a dialup internet connection.  

The software was easy to use, without documentation, though documentation would have been much desired.  The time to fill in the data was not too long.  It took about 4-6 hours given that I had been filing all the tax info in a folder with all the references required.  The help in the software was great and insightful.  I preferred using a CPA in the past, but since my taxes has gotten significantly easier, this has been a definite cost savings.

E-filing was easy, but make sure not to lose the cd-sleeve after downloading the software. Otherwise, it costs extra to e-file.  Overall, it appears to be a great software package with great info and help.  I plan to use it next year, Lord willing!

If you don't have an overly complicated tax return I found that TaxCut is great to use.  The thing I like most is the interview.  Even if you don't think you qualify for what it is asking, say "yes".  It will ask more questions.  If indeed you don't qualify you have lost nothing and can proceed with the interview.  In tax year 2005 it uncovered something I had missed and I filed ammended returns for 2004 & 2005 and pocketed $300.  I also was excited about e-filing and direct deposit.  I filed in early February and had both my Federal and State refunds in my account in three weeks.  It comes with Deduction Pro which makes keeping track of things very simple and it all imports for next year.

Amazon had the best price at $49 and free shipping for the February timeframe

Everything I need to file my Fed and State taxes. I did not expect the Deduction pro to be included; pleasely surprised. I have used Taxcut for a few years now. I like the import of previous year tax data (less typing).

It seems H&R has an online version. It would be nice if their online version can import data from my purchased version. Oh well, maybe next year

I am a computer repair tech and I can bet 90% of the problems reported in these reviews for this product is because people double install security programs. You should never install more than 1 antivirus program into your OS. Most of the decriptions of problems are from doing just that, double installs. PLEASE PLEASE ..remove/uninstall any previous antivirus programs and 3rd party firewalls. then reboot..use a good registry cleaner-freeware program like CCleaner to remove leftover registry keys, then reboot again and then and only then install your new Antivirus/Security program. I have this program and when installed properly on a cleaned system, it works great. A very good product at a very good price. I can't comment on it's tech support, I have never used it

Having a study bible on my palm pilot has been very helpful. Whenever I had some down time I always wished I had my bible. Now I do at all times. It is easy to navigate. Takes up a good amount of memory so just be prepared, but if you have enough memory on a card in your palm, it works great. I have used the memorize help feature a lot as well for memorizing verses. Great product!

I purchased this Bible study set to use with my Palm LifeDrive.  It works perfectly on this device.  Truly, it is exactly what I wanted.  

It should be noted that the NIV Bible - and the other translations in the set - obscure God's name (YHWH).  This makes it easy for mainstream nominal Christians to attribute Jesus as being the almighty God - instead of being simply the only begotten son of the almighty God.

But the translations are otherwise rather good - and the tools offered in this software set make it well worth the money.  After all, God is a judge of hearts and intentions rather than the technical errors of man trying to understand Him.  Jesus preached love of even our enemies rather than legalistic jargon.

It would have been great if the set included an interlinear (word for word translation) of both Old and New Testaments.  That would have been a very great addition; but it would have doubled the cost.  If such becomes available I will gladly pay the price

I bought this NIV study bible and really enjoy the options it provides:  Daily memorization.  Morning and Evening Meditation and Many different ways to "Read the whole bible in a year... read "OT NT PS and Pr. in a year".  N.T. in six months".  "Daily light on a daily path".  Etc.  There are many ways to approach your daily study.   Easy to navigate and can even highlight in colors.   I would recommend this for anyone who wants to take the bible with them on the road or to work or wherever you take your Palm Pilot.

This is a great PDA Bible for many reasons, several of which are already mentioned in other reviews.  It is easy to use, has most of the NIV Study Bible notes and crossreferences, comes with a multi color highlighter (great for using different colors for different purposes...red for commands, blue for promises, etc.), you can change the font for easier reading, and it has a great search engine in case you want all of the references to, say "peace" that occured in the New Testament.  The programs that come with it are nice as well, including one that tells you what to read if you want to read the Bible in one year, the OT in one year, the NT in one year, and many more options.

I was somewhat disappointed by a few features that would have made it a hands-down 5 star program, though.  The original NIV Study Bible has elaborate introductions for each book, including author, purpose, structure, and much more.  The Palm version is lacking all of this, and has no introduction at all.  

The original also has many cultural information boxes all throughout the Bible, like a description of the differences between Pharasees and Sauducees; the palm version does not.  

The cross references are wonderful - click on a small circle after a verse, and all of the cross references pop up.  Simply click on a cross reference, and the program takes you right there.  Unfortunately, however, the Palm program has no feature like a "back" button that gets you back to the original text.  Finding your original spot is not difficult - it only takes 5 seconds and a little concentration - but would have been much nicer to go instantly back the same way you can instantly get to a cross refernce by clicking on it.  

Finally, I would be actively marketing this product and the Palm platform to all of my friends if it included all of the wonderful maps that the original has - maps of the Holyland, Jerusalem, the Middle East, the Temple, and others that are in my paper NIV Study Bible.  

Despite these flaws, however, the program is a joy to use and I highly recommend it to all.  I am using a Tungsten T3 - the larger screen size make reading easier

I've been using TurboTax since 1999. We run two small companies and my background is in accounting. Hence, I have a VERY hard time giving someone else my bookkeeping and taxes to do, since I really have a hard time letting go of the control! (I've really got to get over that!!) Each year, it seems that TurboTax does nothing but improve! I typically delay until the last minute and cram it all in on April 14, and if it wasn't for the simplicity fo this software, I'd be filing extentions every year. Really, gathering all your stuff together is the hardest part. This software does everything else for you.

Turbotax was a great service, but I would like to be able to navigate with menus/tabs to a greater degree of specificity within the input pages itself. Writing the return often requires back-tracking to a page that you alread covered.
To get to a particular prior page, I would often be forced to go through up to 5 or 6 prior pages, reading the question each time because turbotax highlighted the default which was not my previous choice. This was a colossal waste of time in an otherwise excellent product. It could easily be fixed in the 2006 software if turbotax 1) switched the defaults to the users' previously-inputted values (CompleteTax does this and it seems like an obvious thing to do) and/or made it easy to navigate to a prior page by giving a link to every input page when a user clicks a superior tab or link. This is what a good web-page does, and it would be very helpful if turbotax did the same.

This product is very superior over prior versions.It plays back your text in your own voice.My accuracy has improved in Dragon NaturallySpeaking 9 over other previous versions I have used. Having been familiar with prior programs voice to text,it was easy to implement.It was a good investment.

The product came promptly, and with no hassles

I was a Norton user for a long time.  I think this is a better program -- lighter, leaner, easier to use.  It automatically updates frequently.  I've never had a virus.  I use wireless and I can always tell if someone is trying to use my system (which is never, but I've tried to break in myself just to check.)  Nice program

I have always used Norton Products for antivirus.  For the previous 12 months I had problems getting the auto update feature to work and as a result had to download new definitions every time I turned on my computer.  (a royal pain!)  At renewal time, I looked around and found PC-cillin software was highly recommended.  I bought it and loaded it easily.  Since I'm not very computer savy, it took me a little extra time to figure out some of the settings.  It works well.  I miss a couple of Norton features like adding an email sender to the blocked list with one click - but updates load by themselves and I've had no problems.

I've been using Norton Antivirus 2002 with annual updates of patches forever with Norton Internet Security 2003. Now that it's time to renewal Norton Antivirus, I thought I switch to Trend Micro Internet Secuirty 2005 after all the glowing wins it received from certain mainstream computer magazines. I like Norton 2002 but it was a memory resident hog in the TaskManager considering I was running a P3 500 laptop with 196MB on WinXP Pro, resources are valuable. Also newer Norton Antivirus version were a hit and miss.  After also reading reviews at Amazon, I took the plunge with Trend Micro. My review of this product can be best summarize along with it's relations to Norton Antivirus 2002 (updated).

Pros of Trend Micro 2005:
1. Fastest virus scan I've seen. I have not find any virus in my system yet whereas Norton would fail in about .01% of the time( i.e. one stalling virus every year).
2. Check incoming and outgoing mail like Norton
3. Scan selected files as I chose just like Norton
4. Alert and Block virus threats
5. Monitor nearby Wifi connection
6. $25 mail in rebate making the price net at $15. (It's been 2 months since I've mailed it and not received it yet).
7. Uses about 10MB of system background resources versus Norton's 30MB.

Cons against Trend Micro 2005:
1. Very annoying  auto-virus update every day that I log on the internet. I only have a 56k connection and updating takes 5 minutes. I'm not trying to save the internet but everyday update may be a bit too much so I would prefer to have a preference setting that I can choose myself. Norton is not as annoying.

2. On a wifi network, Trend Micro Firewall failed 5 of the Gibson research Shields Up test. Ports were open. Norton Internet Firewall close all major holes except for the non-critical ones which wasn't a big worry. I ended up disabling Trend Micro Firewall and using the Norton Firewall instead as it's a full software and much better analysis and deeper protection.

3. Anti-spam and data protection were subpar as I got advertisements and  pop-up from certain websites like West Cost major newspaper. Using Norton Firewall stops them dead; never seen them again.

4. Still waiting for rebate.

Overall, I think using TrendMicro Internet Security 2005 for it's fast virus check and a separate Norton Internet Firewall is the ideal combo for me. On it's own merit, Trend Micro would be perfect only if RAM and other resources are low as the case with my laptop but I wouldn't mind using Norton if I had plentiful more RAM.

I found the product to work very well for antivirus, spyware and spam.  It is nice to have one product at a reasonable price that has multiple functions rather than 3-4 sperate products and their associated cost and maintenance.  I had been using Norton 2004, but it only did a good job on viruses.  Although it would detect spyware after the fact, it did a poor job of removing them.  I had also used the MS beta, which although detected more spyware than Norton, would not block it.  I had one computer that always seemed to be crippled with spyware.  Since I installed PC-Cillin, I've had no problems.  I've also found the spam blocker to work fairly well, catching about 80% of the spam.  I had been using multiple rules and a spam list with outlook, that probably only blocked about 40% of the spam, so this is a big improvement. 
My only complaint is the rebate- I sent in the required info and it was rejected due to "invalid/missing UPS."  I then sent a copy of the UPS they indicated that was missing, but never got anything back.

I became a committed user of OneNote in its orginal version in 2003. The new 2007 version seems to improve somewhat on this product's functionality. I use OneNote as a depository for research information collection. I can create any number of notebooks and subdivide each into any number of sections and subsections, which allows me to put information where I want it. I recommend that people who collect information in one form or another give OneNote a try.

I've been using OneNote since it was first released.  The 2007 release is the most effective writing/note-taking/information-organizing tool I've ever seen.  Data can be exchanged with other MS Office programs easily.  It can be used with tablet p.c.s, desktops and laptops. 

Information can be organized by Notebook, Section and Page (great for students to keep their notes organized efficiently).  It is a great way to keep research notes, cut-and-paste exerpts, etc.  

This is, quite possibly, the most useful piece of software on the market

I've used version 2003 and enjoyed it thoroughly.  I primarily used it for school with different classes and notes for each.  What was great is that is consolidates everything in a way that makes it easy to retrieve your notes. It also makes it easy to generate reports based on the tagging feature.  The tags allow you to highlight and gather key points of information that make writing papers a breeze.  When working with paper, this was not always an easy task to take on.

Several weeks ago, I downloaded the trial version of OneNote 2007.  The improvements are rather subtle, but powerful.  It didn't take anything to get comfortable with the new features.  After a short time with the trial version I just purchased it because it was so much fun. 

Here are some of the beneficial features:

-Like a paper notebook you have sections, but with OneNote 2007 you can have as many sections as you like.

-You can easily link pages to Outlook. I have linked appointments to a series of notes and support files for various projects and meetings. It makes being organized for a meeting a breeze.

-Also, it's a great way to archive emails in a way that allows you to see them and organize them as you wish.  You can empty your in box and at the same time keep a record of important emails.  Well worth your time.

-It is also tablet friendly if you use a tablet PC like I do.  I love it for that use.  There is a fantastic text recognition feature that works EXTREMELY well. If you use a tablet, this is a great feature.

-As was with the earlier version, you can add voice content to your notes. That's right, voice recorded messages can be added to your notes.  Too cool.

Before you buy, you might want to go to the Microsoft site and download the trial version.  You'll be able to assess for yourself.  I think you'll be pleased.  I fond it to be one of the best products for 'electronic file keeping' that I've used.  For the price, it's not a bad deal.

I have used OneNote 2003 for a couple of years now, and it is a fantastic program.  OneNote 2007 is a very nice upgrade.  It is extremely versatile and works with a variety of organizational styles.  I have gone nearly paperless for my projects.  I can pull in emails, web pages, graphics, scanned documents, MS Office (and other) documents, screen clippings (a OneNote feature), Excel tables, links to files and web sites, etc. OneNote 2007 adds a a better, more intuitive interface, and integrates better with Outlook (e.g., the tasks work together better) and other Office programs.  (Note:  I sue Outlook 2003 at work and Outlook 2007 at home, and OneNote seems to work fine with both).  It also integrates better with Windows Mobile Smartphones and PDAs.  OneNote2007 has a Mobile OneNote component that allows you to take notes on your PDA/Smratphone, and sync them with "Unfiled Notes" tab in OneNote.

A great program that is sure to catch major traction in the coming years

I enjoy using Encarta 2007 and can relie upon their information. I use it in conjunction with Britannica 2007 to get the most well rounded information. I do prefer the interface and ease to Britannica 2007 but the quality of information on Britannica is always to be trusted. 

My advice you need to buy both

Kudos Microsoft. My last go around with Encare was with the 2004 version. At that time the program had a cluttered clusmey interface. The various modules weren't intuitive or intergrated and it was therefore, confusing and not partuiclarly user friendly. The new interface is quite simple but very powerful. It is well integrated with the web and therefore capable of constant updating. Perfect for the student and anyone who likes to research topics. If you have not tried Encarta in a while, check it out, there is much to like.

Encarta Users will have no problem using and enjoying the newest version of Encarta - 2007
It is just as informative as the last versions with a lot of extra kicks, like the newest Videos. Recommend at least 1 GB of RAM and a Pentium 4 Processor with a newer Video card (2 Yrs or better)for the best video viewing
It will run on older system

I purchased Panda Internet Security 2007 for two reasons: The price after rebates (Free) and the fact that it is a 3-user license.  After switching from McAfee to Norton (and a subsequent 1-year renewal) I decided to either buy PC-Cillin 2007 or try Panda. (39.99 or Free...hmm...)  I installed Panda on my laptop first (after uninstalling Norton Internet Security 2005).  No problem what-so-ever.  In the initial HDD scan, Panda found and cleaned 5 files that were found in my email inbox identified as a worm.  I then installed Panda on 2 desktop machines with no problems there either.  Panda found 3 traces of spyware on one machine and nothing on the second.  

Panda boots up with Windows XP quickly.  It has only given me a couple of pop-up messages (one for a WiFi intrusion, which was another computer on my network...I accepted it and it never came back.  The other pop-up was to start on-line customer service or something like that...I declined it and it has yet to come back.)

My laptop is a P4 1.8GHz, 1GB ram, 32MB ATI video, 40GB HDD.  The initial virus scan took less than 20 minutes, scanning over 250,000 files.  Not bad!  Desktop 1's first scan (P4 2.4GHz, 512MB, 128MB video, 120GB HDD) scanned nearly 300,000 files also under 20 minutes.  Desktop 2 was the quickest (P4 3.4GHz, 1GB, 128MB video, 80GB HDD) scanning over 330,000 files in about 15 minutes.

I am extremely impressed with Panda Internet Security 2007.  It's everything I hoped it would be.  I would definitely recommend this product to others

Purchased this a while ago and recieved it yesterday.

Reason? My computer was moving much slower than it used to. Mcafee scans my computer everyday, and doesn't find anything, yet it was fully updated. I had a feeling it wasn't working.

When I installed this thing, I scanned it right away. This is what it found:

Viruses: 67

Spyware: 312

Adware: 51

After the scan, everything was deleted and my computer ran like new again. I am very pleased with Panda's software and will purchase again if needed

The product came well-packaged and unopened. I really needed instructions on how to open the packaging. But once I got it opened and installed, the product works as well as promised. The set-up and ribbon menu is a lot more user-friendly than 2003. I downloaded the trial version that Microsoft had offered, and I must say that this is the best Office product offered by Microsoft to date

If you don't need outlook but do need powerpoint, this is a great value.  Before, you had to be a student or teacher to get a good price (full retail $150 now).  Office 2003 standard even on eBay is still going for $175 plus.  This does not offer anything much beyond Office 2003 but the new ribbon format is not difficult to learn.  Also, don't worry about file formats.  You can re-set the default format to prior formats so that anything you send out can be read by earlier versions of Microsoft Office.

This is great! The free trial version on download.com had saved my computer (the only program that got rid off some spyware that was in my start-up and causing lots of problems). And I've also used the trial version on several of my friends' computers. It hasn't picked up much, though, since I bought it. But that's probably because now I have a new hard drive and a firewall. Before, I  bought the computer used and didn't know what a firewall was. I should have saved the disk and installed it when I started having problems. But oh well, it's doing it's job and if I start having problems once the CD expires, then I will probably buy a new disk. That's how good it is

All in all a fine product.  Has gotten excellent reviews from PC MAG.

Norton slowed my machine to a crawl.  This has not.

Suggest NEVER paying full retail for it unless you absolutely have to.  I've been using it for a few years now and always manage to find a free after rebate deal on it a few months before the one year subscription period is up.

It does require the user to provide authorizations the first time it sees a programs attempting to access the web.  For a non techie, this may seem a bit intimidating because there will be a lot of queries from it in the first few days of usage

This is what you need if you want a suite of protection for you pc.
I've used mcafee. It drove me nuts. I've used norton. Also drove me nuts. ZoneAlarm worked nearly flawlessly (as well as windows can.) It is a very stable and intuitive program that is what I have been looking for. All I can is that you should buy this and get rid of whatever you're using now, especially if it's Mcafee or norton. Just a sidenote: I run AVG free antivirus alongside this and I also ran it alongside norton and mcafee. AVG would catch things that neither Norton nor mcafee would. Never have had that problem with ZoneAlarm

I have Windows XP which came with McAfee. I used both Norton and McAfee but lately McAfee's updates seem to have giving other users a lot of trouble.  Rather than updating the anti-virus definitions, etc., I decided to try Zone Alarm where many users seem to like it.  

I must say that from the moment I installed it the only problem I ran was that you have to completely unistall your current antivirus, firewall, etc. if ZoneAlarm is  to work.  To date the software has worked beautifully.   Actually, I believe that my computer runs smoother and slightly faster.  I definately would upgrade or buy this product again.  Check some of the sellers for the bargain prices.  I bought mine for 19.99, which is a big savings from the ZoneAlarm website.  It is worth every penny

I had to put this review in because of the unfair one previously given. 
  Before I purchased this software, I checked out 5-6 of the major fish screensavers out their and this one is by far the most realistic, (movement, background, lighting, and noise).  I have two computers, one 800 mHz the other 1.4 gHz processor and the program runs perfect on both.  The goldfish screensaver is just as impressive, if you're into that kind of fish.  Don't let other marine/freshwater screen savers fool you by advertising more fish and backgrounds, the quality in all aspects, especially 3d-graphics and color (which are a must if your looking for realism), are poor.  I personally thought I'd like the extra fish and backgrounds (turtles in particular) in a competitors screen saver, so I purchased it instead of this one.  After trying it, I was very disapointed and luckily I was able to receive a refund.  I purchased Marine Aquariun and have never regretted it since.  What's great is they have a demo on their website your can try out too

I got Tiger to improve the working of my Powerbook G4 1.5.  My Jaguar installation was getting pokey after two years and a clean install with Tiger cleared out the annoying slowdowns in my computer.  Before Tiger, my computer would hang when playing large DV files (such as the ones I made in iMovie) but now they run without a hitch even though the hardware is the same.  This Tiger upgrade doesn't include some of the apps (games, Quicken, etc.) that my wife has on her new MacBook, but it did include a 30-day trial verion of iWorks which has come in handy

Why not have the best possible operating system for the best possible computer.  While this OS is not the top of the line today, it was when I bought it.  If you buy the MAC, it pays to have the best operating system. Stay current.  The hardest jump was from OS 8 to OS 9.  I was unable to bring any of my peripherals with me.  Now it is seamless. Like they say, just "Plug n Play.

Why buy the upgrade when you can buy the full version?

Basically cause it was cheap. You will see, old version, new version, 10.4.6, 10,4,8 and so on. I just bought the old version and installed the latest update. Now I am up to date and for a lot less money which meant I could spend the extra cash on more software for my Mac.

As far as performance, No faster than Jaguar or Panther. The Benchmarks say faster but if you stare at the screen in any version, the 10 nano seconds you save are not noticable.

You will encounter drive issues at some point as this version appears to have issues more often. This seems to be due to the new journaling scheme but I cannot back this up.

If possible I recommend you erase the drive you are installing to. In the disk utility, select the erase tab, and then the security button, Select the zero out data option. Note: you cannot erase a drive but only a volume.

This will clear out any corrupt data and pinpoint any bad or damaged sectors.

The main reason I wanted this was for the widgets. They are a blessing. Calculator, thesarus, package tracking, and many more. Tiger only comes with about a dozen widgets but in the widget configuration button, you will see the more widgets option. You will be directed to hundreds of others widgets for immediate and FREE installation.

My favorite is the weather and radar widget as I work outdoors a lot. I am able to quickly see the latest radar and plan my week, all by press F12. No need to interupt what I am doing on the Mac as the widgets will pop up in my layout and my activities stay active. Click any area other than a widget and they hide away.

If you want to wait for a version of the OSX that allows you to write your own widgets without taking a programming course, wait for Leopard

Tiger is simply the most advanced personal Operational System on Earth!

I am an advanced used. I have used all sorts of operational systems in the last decades: IRIX (unix from Silicon Graphics), SUNos (unix from Sun), Linux, and also the bad written Windows. Everytime I used Windoze in the last 20 years, I had to deal with crashes, hanging, lost of data and hours of configurations, tuning, adjusts, cleaning, etc. Even today, everytime I shutdown Windoze, it hangs, due to some program crashing. It's a true joke!!!

On February 2005 I decided to buy a Mac and give it a try. I bought a Mac Mini and started using it.

What I have to say is that I am using it for more than an year without an issue, without a crash. System is solid as rock. Some bad written programs eventually crash, but never the system. And I am the kind of guy who works with several heavy programs with heavy documents opened at the same time. Mac never crashed. I am about to suggest Apple a way to make it crash, so we can rest a little bit, instead of working all the time.

So much trouble I had in the past with Windoze that even today, while I am using the Mac, I feel like it will crash at any time. Fortunately it never crashed.

Beyond those functions advertised by Apple, you will see that MacOS is a superb gold mine for those who want to explore under the hood. Filled with thousands of powerfull unix commands and programs, you will be able to perform miracles.

Microsoft is copying everything it can from Tiger and advertising it as revolutionary features of up comming Windows (hasta la) Vista. I cannot see a single revolutionary function on Vista, as everything already exists on Tiger. The most amazing is some sites on the web comparing Vista (a vaporware not yet launched) with Tiger (an actual product).

The only thing Gates forgot is that one month after Vista is released, Apple will launch Leopard that will take the crown from Tiger.

What I can say you is that for the first time on years I have joy of using a personal computer.

Everything was perfect until I used Expos. The animation was a little choppy, but that probably has more to do with using an iBook G3 than with Tiger

Before buying QuickBooks you should Google: QuickBooks 2007 Simple Start Free Starter Edition. This free version never times out. You can immediately download 400m or get the CD with no shipping charge. The big limit in the free upgradeable version is you only get 20 total customers and vendors, so it is ideal for students and those with limited needs

Super simple to install, and easy to use.  This program gives you a real perspective of how you use your money.  I created a "personal" account company.  It doesn't have to be for small business only, but will be handy if we decide to set up a small business in the future.  The price was just right for our purpose.

I have used Quickbooks Basic for a number of years both in my church and for my business.  I have kept QB 2004 Basic since the upgrades were not immediately necessary for me.

I chose to upgrade this year to keep current on maintenance, etc. so again I chose the most basic product offered - "Simple Start".  I received it just fine and it installed perfectly.

However, it does not upgrade any previous QB files.  As I investigated, Intuit says that it won't upgrade files from previous QB versions on their web site (albeit in small print) and on the product box itself, but that was not ever mentioned in the Amazon listing.

So then I had to upgrade to the next higher version - an additional $80.  QB Pro also works very well; it's just a shame that Intuit insists on misleading customers by not providing full information through all marketing channels.  The Intuit phone rep also tried to overcharge me $20 for the upgrade but quickly accepted the correct amount when I pointed out their error a second time.

Great backup solution. I install a second hard drive into someones computer and then let the software run and then forget about it. Never fails. Have not done a restore yet, but I would imagine it would be easy since I have an image of the hard drive and then the data that is up to date. Also, bought the software from a vendor that Amazon recommends, I don't no why they do this, but the software listed on Amazon is $49.99 which is the right price. I bought two from a vendor for $15.00 each. WOW what a savings and a great markup for me

All I needed was to upgrade the hard drive on my Dell laptop, so I got Acronis True Image version 9 for half the price of the current version 10.

I put the new hard drive (right off the sealed box) into a USB caddy that I got on eBay for $6, plugged it into the USB port, and ran Acronis 9.  Selected the "Clone Drive" wizard, and less than an hour later it was done.

No need to cross my fingers... the new drive booted right up, and I'm using it now to write this review.  What could be easier

I started with Norton Ghost 2003 many years ago and had problems backing up clone images.  Acronis True Image Backup 9.0 has a simple user interface that works well.  I used it to re-image my son's computer without any problems.  It is a good product for the price.  I highly recommend making a backup image of your hard drive on a weekly basis

In general...this program worked very well.  I've had a hard time putting my new Dual Core Pentium D computer in the RAID 1 configuration, so I bought this instead.  The clone function works extremely well and is an adequate alternative to the RAID 1 configuration, but I was a bit confused about how to use the "incremental backup" function.  The initial backup went well, but when I went back for incremental backup additions, it would tell me it was "impossible"....so I just clone the C drive every few weeks now.  I have two Seagate 320 GB SATA hard drives, and it's great to know that I have an exact copy of the c drive if I fry it.  I live in Ethiopia, so the power fluctuations are frequent and disastorous.  I've already lost one hard drive to power flux abnormalities.  I'd buy this product again, and it's comforting to know that it's on my system and that I can back up my valuable data easily and quickly when I need to

Why haven't I heard about the Mia characters before? I bought this for my god daughters 6th birthday without knowing anything about the game. We opened it together and I was BLOWN AWAY with the 3D animation-the same quality as Pixar. Everyone at the party was glued to the computer screen in this adventure land game. Best of all, its educational but because it was so entertaininng, my god-daughter has not stopped playing it. Well worth your money! I'm going to buy the rest of the Mia series

I recently purchased Microsoft office, and so far, I have had the chance to use Microsoft word.  I am familiar with the product as I have had the older version before, with my old computer.  
I was pleased to find that I had no trouble with using my old files with this new software.  I also was glad to find a variety of templates which were easy to use.  I was able to print out business cards for me and my husband in just one morning.  
I am also glad that it isn't very much different from the old version, so I was able to use the program easily, without much adjustment.

This product is simple to use and does a good job converting my home VHS tapes onto DVD.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish it supplied the connection cables with the product.  Other than that, I have no gripes.

Don't think about video capture cards, going into the operating system, or even opening the computer case - just turn on the power, plug Dazzle's USB plug into your usb port, and connect the colored cords on your vcr with the same colored plugs on Dazzle, install the software, and let this wonderful tool do all of the heavy lifting.

EXCELLENT quality, and they will lower the quality if you want a smaller file - like, say, if you want to back-up your vcr to a cd-r. The test for quality is time - tell it to record to 70 minutes, and your work is DONE.

I REALLY like the fact that the software is so stable, I recorded a SIX HOUR VCR tape using a 512 meg XP machine - not a moment's problem.

They also included software that makes editing these video files real easy, if you want. That is just icing on the cake.

Strong, solid, silent - the John Wayne of VCR to computer file translator tools.

As an aside, I have held onto some VCR tapes for years, one for more than a decade, hoping something like Dazzle would come along.

Prayers answered.

Just shut up and BUY it

The Quality is EXCELLENT! Use it to go out of the Digital Cable Box Strait into the computer. Pinnacle Software is easy to use and edit with and if you have a DVD Burner, makes great menus. I have bought and returned Well Over 5 RCA Capture Devices and this is BY FAR the best. Especially for $50!!!!!! Cant BEAT It

I did not think that introduction to the game was going to end.  I thought that I may be able to skip it but no luck.  Once into the game I believe that my child was enjoying the game and seem to be learning some great skills.  Lastly, you have to hit the "F" keys and "Esc" to save and exit the game, not many program make you do that today.

Overall, I feel that this was a good purchase and I would have given 5 stars if functionally was better with program

the mia series are great for our family.  the kids always look forward to playing their mia games.  they have the math adventure and grandmas remedy.  the two disc thing is confusing...but really doesn't interrupt play.  the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because it can be a little glitchy sometimes...mia will get stuck somewhere and not respond.  we just go back to a game saved in a similar spot and restart.  so it's not too big a deal.

I've been a Corel user since ver 5 or so. It's always been a decent graphics application, but Ver 12 and now 3X are the best I've ever seen. This program is SO INTUITIVE compared to others in this category. It;s particularly easier than Quarkxpress. I know Quark's a page layout app, but you can do the exact same stuff 95% of the time in Corel. Much better PDF's and a HUGE price advantage make this their best version yet. Indesign is also very good but pure useability gives Corel an edge.

I think some of the reviewers here did not use the program more enough, am using it since version 2 till now as an illustrator this program can't be beated... gradient fill was so stupid to create in earlier versions of adobe illustrator u must create two objects then blend them together to form a gradient fill then you have to mask it within a path or the shape you are filling, one more thing the mask in corel "container" is a wonderful tool to have much better than the mask used in illustrator that sucks (u have to see me pulling out my hear if i made i mistake using it) do you want more i have a lot to mention.

Am using both program everyday know them very well and to be honest i do all the artwork in coreldraw then i export to illustrator for color separation and printing and that becuase the printers agancies in my country don't know how to use corel so i have to ride the wave and finalize thing in illustrator.

I do all detailed drawings precisely using the guidelines and grid (first in available in corel) creating layouts, realistic objects or models with shadings and shadowing as well with ease this software is so powerfull if you are a real artist you must get i

I'm going to keep it forever and ever.The 2 expansion packs to complete my screensaver of fish is the Arowana pack and the funstuff pack.

Every once in a while a product comes along that does one thing, and does it really well. The only question is "do you need it" With modern LCD screens and sleep/energy save modes, screen savers are virtually unnecessary. That's really the point of Aquazone, it has no practical value, but it is very cool.

Before we got our little dog Tova, we had a fish tank for a number of years. I do miss some of the relaxing aspects of watching fish swim around and interact. Fish are generally low maintance and considered by many a key stress reducer. I think of this screen saver program as a virtual tamagotchi or a aquatic version of the Sims. You can do everything you would do with a normal fish tank: add and remove fish, feed them, tap on the glass (or the keyboard in this case). Even better, you can mix fresh water and salt water, no worries about two male Betas in the same tank Fortunately you don't have to clean the tank and you don't get algae. If you want fish not included in the tank, you can buy some more online
If you ( or someone you know) enjoys fish and want to buy something fun and rather frivolous, this is a great program. If you aren't into fish, probably not worth buying

Pros: Does exactly what is says, creates a virtual fish tank
Cons: Probably a productivity waster at the office, gotta love fish to enjoy the program

I have a PowerBook, an iMac, and an eMac at home that are used in different ways. The kids use the eMac for school work, and my wife & I use the other 2 Macs for home business.

Although most school work was required in MS-PowerPoint or MS-Word, exporting from iWork '06 Pages and Keynote was very simple to do with 90-95% accuracy. Our kids said they just do minor editing at school before submitting the work.

For home business, we use Pages to do our proposals, bills, and receipts. And use Keynote for presentations. One thing that I thought was amazing, is the fact that I can display the notes and the succeeding slide on my PowerBook, while projecting just the current slide for the customer to see. 

For the price of the Family Pack, we were licensed to use iWork '06 on 5 Macs on the same network. The cost fitted our budget perfectly. The only thing I wish was available in Keynote was timed transition (example: after 3 seconds show bullet#1, after 5 seconds show bullet#2, after 2 seconds show the chart

Well its definetly improved version since the last one, but they still have a lot of things to do.  The biggest problem is Pages.  If text has specific symbols, like Greek letters and u try to export your file to doc, forget it.  u'll have the same problem as 10 yrs ago, either funky symbols or underline dashes.  Keynote is much better.  But if u r a scientist and not a sales man, both packages still have a lot of room for improvement.  However, I'm still happy with this purchase, because it's Apple soft and looks much nicer than any MS software will get in the future

Abobe hits one out of the park. I find Adobe software clunky and hard to use. While I understand that the more flexibility you want the more complex the program but Photoshop and InDesign have learning curves that are steeper than Mount Everest. I expected Lightroom to be the same - an excellent program with a huge learning curve. Well it is and it isn't which it why Lightroom is such a pleasure to use. I don't know what Adobe is thinking in creating this gem of a program but the team who designed it are collective geniuses. For they have taken a complex and sometimes frustrating chore and for lack of better words made it gentle and pleasing. The program makes spending time with your photographs actually enjoyable.

Lightroom is fabulous from look and feel to functionality. The strength is not only in the photo management portion of the program but also in the strong photo developing functions that can turn an OK photo into an amazing one.

If you do anything with photographs buy this program. You won't regret it

I've only been using Lightroom for a day, but I was pleasantly surprised with the Photoshop integration. Just hit Cmd-E, and Lightroom creates a copy of the photo (with our without the changes you applied in Lightroom) for editing in Photoshop format, and groups that copy in a stack with the original. As you save your changes in Photoshop, the image is updated in Lightroom. 

I felt that the workflow was very smooth.

This is a great software for Photographers looking for a faster way to manager and edit images. I gave it a four because I would hope that ADOBE would still find ways to improve this product. The functionality is superb, and for such a great program, it doesn't eat too much memory on your computer (I have a 4 year old PC with 768 MB of RAM). And because of this I'm shooting more pictures in RAW format and not worry about the time I spend in front of the computer.

I'll definitely be buying the next upgrade

Within a couple days after installing Dragon, it showed a high degree of accuracy. The accuracy depends on how late at night you dictate.  It was installed on a 2.7 Celeron with 512 of memory.  The program generally keeps up quite well. The program works with Comcast and AOL free ride but seem to have a lot of glitches with aol.com

This is probably one of the most outstanding and rewarding software programs that I can ever remember purchasing. I never learned how to type, so I reserved myself from many computer projects/reports, email responses and business related aspects due to this 'achilles heel'.

Well, I researched this software and found that it has come a long way from earlier versions and decided it's time to give it a try. I even bought a Plantronics CS55 - USB wireless headset from the get go to give this software a real workout. Let me tell you, my pessimism was definitely challenged because the software worked extremely good about 20 minutes after opening the box and browsing the tutorial. I was talking sentences and watched it appear on my monitor within seconds. I speeded up my speach as if talking in a normal conversation with someone and this software just kept spitting it on-screen. AMAZING!!!! Don't get me wrong. There are occasional misspellings to deal with but your user profile keeps getting updated everytime you use it and prevents the same mistakes from occuring the next time. It begins to gain more and more accuracy.

Salvation has been found as far as I'm concerned.

P.S. I began running the program with WIN XP - 512MB Ram and it performed very well. I just upped to 2 gigs ram. Most everyone in forums recommends at least 1 gig Ram.

I did this review in about 1 min. and had only two misspells.

The program seems to be much more accurate.  I am still learning but I feel it was a worthwhile investment.  I can write my e-mail much faster now.  I highly recommend it and I feel it was worth the cost

I really enjoy this product, and am sure that voice-recognition will be standard techology for all computers one day.  It is very easy to load, set up and use....  everything that I needed was in the box. I speak with a slight accent, and it still works so smoothly. This is an invaluable tool for people at risk from carpal tunnel syndrome, for those who have difficulty using a keyboard efficiently, or for avoiding the fatigue of preparing large reports. It is so simple that you can speak out ideas and visualize them in print before deciding what to do next.  Great for doing e-mail...  all this and you can continue using the keyboard as you wish. I love it!

i really like my new windows vista upgrade.the graphics are stunning and it is extremely user friendly.infact, i liked vista business so much, i upgraded to the ultimate version.both versions are very easy to install;many people seem to be waiting for 'all the bugs to be worked out' but, honestly, the bugs aren't a problem.it is important to run the advisor about -is your system ready for vista before you install- to get rid of any conflicts your computer might have with vista;other than that everything else is a breeze. Use my system about 6 hours a day and am using a xps 700 dell computer go for it, you'll have lots of fun!

Product has a nice clean interface. I was able to load most drivers and application software without incident. Note - Upgrade install requirements are not clear. Microsoft should state what is expected on your system prior to trying to install either as an upgrade or clean install. Microsoft sites keep pointing back to sites that don't help very much.

GREAT PRODUCT. JUST ONE DOWNFALL.  CHECK WHETHER YOUR PRINTER AND OTHER SOFTWARE/HARDWARE IS COMPATIBLE FIRST.  I'VE HAD WINDOWS VISTA SINCE IT CAME OUT AND MY PRINTER DRIVER IS STILL NOT COMPATIBLE.  WHICH MEANS I HAD TO PURCHASE ANOTHER PRINTER IN ORDER FOR IT TO WORK.

I just upgraded SD v4 to SD5 and could not be happier. Release 5 has had a very rocky start to say the least. I do believe they released it a bit early. Fortunately I read the SD forums daily and only downloaded version 5 when it seemed the big bugs had been dealt with.
I have always found this product to be the best in it's class. Best detection and moreover removal. Easy to use. I've also had the product that is typically rated number 1 and for me it is no contest which I will stick with. This is my main, real time anti spyware product. 
I think one big plus is their customer service availability. This is important.  They are very responsive. Their forums on their website are also extremely helpful. Customer service is also free.  This application is fast and is not a resource hog. I have a lot of confidence in it. Also recently just downloaded their PC Tools Plus firewall...it's another great product and it is free!
Basically a good company to deal with.  I believe when the dust settles from this new (albeit too early) release of version 5, you will see Spyware Doctor attain 1st place on many tech lists

I am very pleased with the new 2007 Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe.  I have owned previous versions of this product and for my needs, I am well satisfied.  I especially like the ability to use suggested greetings and clip art to enhance my rubber stamped cards and scrapbooking projects.  I have used this software to print banners and business flyers as well.  It would be nice if multiple images could be contained in a text box.  Maybe in the future there will be more enhancements to this product for easiser use.  I am pleased with the card selection, verses and graphics.  For non professionals, I believe you get more than a fair value for the price

I bought this program for my daughter for her birthday.  She wanted it because she's used it at school (1st grade).  

I was impressed by how easy it was to install - I installed it as admin, and she had no issues running it under her limited account (XP PRO).

I've been impressed with what she is able to do with the program.  She even made Valentine's day cards for her whole class with it.

Just be prepared to go through a lot of color ink

Essential for Microsoft Office 2007 users running Windows Vista. Office 2007 already provides a PDF converter; however, it does not allow for security, editing, or markup. PDF Converter does--and without the Tech Support hassles at Adobe. Since my new HP computer came with Adobe Reader already installed in the Vista environment, I kept it as the default pdf reader, and I use PDF Converter Professional for actual, stand alone conversion or editing of pdf documents. PDF Converter had a very easy Custom Install feature. I disabled all Microft Office, Internet Explorer, and Outlook add-ins, and I installed the product. It all works together extremely well.

Excellent product works as advertised and so simple to use. Product well packaged, arrived earlier than expected and in mint condition. ScanSoft responded with an eMail in a timely fashion acknowledging receipt of my Rebate paperwork and provided a pin number for me to access their site to check on it's progress. But you know Rebates....they take forever!
PDF Converter 4 is not my only ScanSoft Product. I also use Paperport 10 and am extremely satisfied with that.
My buying experience has always been positive with Amazon.com vendors, never a problem.

I have not used this product for very long, and was somewhat reluctant to purchase another brand besides Adobe who seem to dominate in this softward category, but I have, so far, been plaesantly surprised with the performance & features.  The ScanSoft PDF Converter Pro 4 software seems to do all Adobe can do (and a little more), at a fraction of the exhorbitant cost of Adobe Pro 8!.  I'm happy with my purchase thus far!

After looking at the other reviews, I was a bit puzzled.  I haven't had any of the problems other folks mention. PDF Converter Professional 4 doesn't do everything that programs costing FIVE TIMES as much money.  But, WHO CARES?  Background colors in a business form?  WHY????  

Don't buy a Camry and say "gee... I liked my Lexus better."

Most of you are going to buy this program to do one - or both - of these two things: 
 
1)CONVERT PDF DOCUMENTS into completely editable Word docs, Excel Worksheets, or one of dozens of other formats...

2)COMBINE documents of various formats into a single pdf. Picture a CUSTOMER MANUAL that consists of Word, Excel, SolidWorks, Quicken, PowerPoint and Project documents.   You want to put them all together in ONE document complete with Table of Contents, Bookmarks and Thumbnails.  VOILA!  This is the proram for you! 

And for these purposes, PDF 4 Professional is SUPERB.  It is EASY to use. We have SEVERAL users, and not one has had to refer to a manual or on line support. 

To put PDF Converter to the test, we recently scanned, then saved-as-a-pdf a crooked, not highly legible fax.  We THEN converted it into a Word document, and roughly 90% of it came through perfectly.  AMAZING.

HIGHLY Recommended

I understand that software companies strive to give new versions of their products "new" or "better" appearances but in my opinion toos and defaults should be recognizable from version to version as much as possible.  I have used versions of Corel since CorelDraw!3 I just moved to X3 from 10 and find that the trace tool works better but the mechanism is somewhat cryptic.  I would have great sympathy for a buyer that is using it for the first time if they had never used an older version simply because I could only figure it out through past knowledge and trial and error.  The results were great but the methodology lacks some of the intuitiveness of the past versions.  The pallettes are far less comprehensive thn version 10's pallettes.  I truly wish I had version 8's pantone pallette back even though it is incomplete it was so much better layed out.  i will never understand why black has to be at one end of the pallette and white at the other, waste of time...   The tools are all there but they appear different.  I went to work in X3 fright away and found I could work effectively on day one but I did resort to version 10 (which I have kept on my system) a few times in the first week to perform operations that I coupdn't figure out in X3 which were simple in 10.  The Help files are circuitous, apparently never actually getting to the point.  The on line tutorials are great for the absolute novice but useless to anyone who actually has worked with vector art before.  The Export to AI is still a little inaccurate even after all these years.  (You cannot select a line terminus and expect it to be there in AI) The EPS export filter doesn't always want to be readable in Adobe either.  The price is excellent, the product spectacular in its own right and I am happy with my purchase. I expected a little more in this version than I got but no less than I had with additional compatibility.  I still need to have a copy of Illustrator on my machine to deal with people who have only that program

This is one of the best graphics suites that I have ever used.  It is very user friendly and all the my students that I have used it have really liked it.  The toolbars are easy to find and the entire program is filled with outstanding graphics tools.  This is a must have for anyone who is serious about graphics

CorelDraw was my first foray into vector graphics back when version 3 showed up on my desk at the small "Mom and Pop" screenprinting shop i worked at. Back then, Corel came with OODLES of free fonts, clipart, manuals ... not to mention FREE technical support via a toll-free number.

i stayed with Corel exclusively until version 10 ... enduring countless patches, bugs and the dreaded "odd-numbered" curse (if you tried version 5 or 7, you feel my pain). Adobe Photoshop was always my photo-editing program of choice ... CorelPhotoPAINT just never quite "did it" for me.

Industry demands eventually delegated that i delve into Adobe Illustrator. Being already familiar with Adobe Photoshop's features, tools and "look and feel", Illustrator didn't present a huge, overbearing learning curve. In Illustrator, i found the same robust features as CorelDraw ... which wasn't what impressed me about Illustrator. Adobe's intuitive programs, and their ability to interact with one another ... seamlessly ... THAT is what won me over to Illustrator. Illustrator's ability to edit/create PDF's in their native format? WOW! Exporting LAYERED vector files to Photoshop ... with layers INTACT??? WOW!!! (i could go on)

Now, that being said ... there are STILL things that i prefer in CorelDRAW  compared to Illustrator. The EXTRUDE function in corel is MUCH easier to utilize. The PowerClip function is more user friendly than Illustrator's "make clipping mask" function. The ability to customize/edit/add shortcut keys is an amazing feature. (again ... i could go on)

In regards to importing and exporting files from other applications, CorelDRAW wins, hands down. It boasts a ROBUST set of import and export filters, my favorite being the .eps import filter which lets you import an .eps while converting the fonts to curves DURING the import. This is a MUST HAVE if you work with an .eps file created on another computer whose fonts you lack. If i had a dollar for every .eps that pulls into Illustrator with fonts blown out ... i'd be independently wealthy. WHY Illustrator has never implemented this is beyond me.

So, to sum it up ... CorelDRAW is a great program ... but i can't imagine it being my ONLY vector drawing program. Just like in real life, you need a great team. This program, paired with Adobe Creative Suite, meets my needs perfectly

I am average when it comes to design, but the tutorial helped me in creating a logo and it's cheaper and better for me to create one myself than pay someone to do it.  I like the tracing feature which allows you to remove parts of a photo to place in a new background.  To get the most out of this software you really need to be familiar with a lot of the features already, and there's a lot I am missing.  I will just have to take more time to keep practicing and learning from trial and error

I have been a Corel user for years.  This latest version is a great improvement.  Esp for Raster to Vector tracing.  I have always preferred to use Corel over our Illustrator even though I have both installed on my system.  Corel just seems to be a much more user friendly program.  Very powerful for anyone from Novice to Pro user

I have used Corel Draw since it was Draw 5 or 6, I can't exactly recall for certain so I guess some would consider me a software guru. I have also used other top level design tools and can tell you the fact is the Corel Draw Suite X3 is a robust design suite that has a very palatable learning curve.

The scope of what you can do with the software is amazing so certainly there is a new set of words to add to one's vocabulary however with terms like Pick Tool, Rectangle Tool, Ellipse Tool, and the like, I believe that it is pretty logical to get an idea of what the tools do just by allowing the mouse pointer to rest over the tool for about three seconds so the application can display the tool name and even the shortcut key to select the tool. 

The icons also give a pretty clear visual representation of what the tool will do e.g. a capital A is the text tool and guess what you do with it ... it allows you to add paragraph text, and artistic text. After you learn a bit about the text tool you also see that it allows you to place text in your document on a path.

The text on a path is just that... text on any path in your document. This can be a freehand line, an ellipse, a circle, or any other shape you care to make. How many of you have ever wanted to put your text in an arch?  In Corel Draw you simply make an ellipse with the ellipse tool, choose the text tool from the tool box, move the mouse pointer over to the ellipse and the mouse cursor changes to the text on a path icon and you click the left mouse button.  Now you type whatever you want around the shape that you have created.  If the text is not the size, color, font, or position you want you can change it, color it, or move it simply by selecting the pick tool.

I have developed a program to teach technology skills to middle & high school students with various disabilities in 46 sites throughout Oklahoma and the Corel Draw Suite is the first software application the students use. Do the students know how to do everything with the software after the first week, or fourth, or tenth? No, but if it took a week to learn it would not be a design tool in would be something like Print Shop Pro where almost everything is done for you and you just type in the text. There is nothing wrong with PSP but if you want to truly be creative, if you want to have the ability to design anything that you can see in your minds eye, then the Corel Draw Suite is the tool you want.

My program has a website that shows some of the work the students in the program have created. Just do a search for Tech-Now Oklahoma High School High Tech and you should be able to find the site. The section on weekly curriculum is a pretty good place to start but I encourage you to look around. Almost everything you will see on the site was created by the students using the Corel Draw Suite.

Corel Draw is a program that can be used in a matter of minutes but is as deep as you can possibly want to go.

I love this product. I had so many pictures that need to be in a scrapbook. This was so fast and easy, also it only took a couple of weeks to complete. I didn't over spend on paper,tape,glue, and etc. With three kids I don't have the time to sit down and cut, measure and more. with all my pages completed. I added a FEW things to go along with the theme of my page. I even used left over Christmas wrap to fill the 12X12 for Christmas pictures/theme

I would recommend this software for anyone who likes to scrapbook, but also for those who enjoy doing anything with pictures.  You can make calendars, greeting cards, birthday cards etc., as well as flyers.  The price for this software is very cheap for the quality and the amount you get from it.  It is a must

I had a hard time putting this one down. I quickly read through the entire collection and it was over too quickly. I would recommend this to any X-men fan especially fans of the old comic books and it certainly takes up a lot less room than if I had the hardcopy versions. 
My only complaint is that it ends at the beginning of a new story. Ah well..

This works fairly well for me.  It easily downloads the capital gains from Microsoft Money, the interviews are fairly straightforward.  However there are a few areas (like foreign tax credit) where it should be automated but isn't.  But on the whole it does a nice job, they just need to improve it a little every year then it could be a 5 star item.

In general, an easy, straightforward program that gets the job done

First of all, I want to make the point that this is a strategy based tycoon game and a sim game.  It is really well done using superb graphics and animations.  You get to apply new discoveries in your factories so you can make a better product and out sell them to your competitors.  It all seems to be based on real history so you get information from real sources like the Wright brothers, Edison and even Einstein. And you also have to worry about the people that work in your factories, your scientists, and accountants and even worry about industrial espionage. If you like business, engines, buildings, science and physics, you'll be getting hours and hours of play out of this game.  You also get to play in a bunch of different cities in the world.  Each one has different challenges. It's fresh every time you play since you can do things differently and see how the results vary

Would highly recommend. We attend dog show that are in the middle of no were... This product got us to EVERY SHOW  we have been to since we started using it in March 2007.We especially in enjoyed the feature of being able to find what kind of business were in the area were.We hate getting lost especially with a truck loaded down with dogs and conformation equiptment, this product has stopped that from happening.   It would be nice if the 2008 version: 1 - it spoke the name of the streets while it was giving you the next turn 2- it would get rid of that agreement screen everytime you use it, once should be enough and 3 - It would be nice if we could log on to the web and down load the latest addition of gas station, place to eat and etc...  while we were down loading the construction updates. This product is a good buy for the money..

Just completed a 1600 mile trip from Ohio to Virginia Beach and the Microsoft Streets and Trips with GPS worked better than expected. Only lost the GPS in extremely hilly areas. No loss in towns. This thing is very precise for the low price paid. If you pull into a place such as a Gas Station, you have the address immediately. It can route you back to your mapped routing if you make a wrong turn. Pressing the space bar will get you the next turn in case you missed hearing the last prompt. This is a powerful program and should be an asset to any traveler. A co-pilot is good to have but not totally necessary. As mentioned above, it will route you back to your road if needed. A great buy. Would be nice if the prompt would name the street or route

Purchased this to help navigate a trip from Northern Michigan to South-west Florida and back again. We took a fair amount of side trips and having this on our laptop made it easy to get to where we wanted to go.  There were a couple of times that we went "off route" but were back on route in very little time.  It helped us decide where to stop for fuel, eat and sleep.  Up-to-date information is available with an internet connection and the larger map-viewing area was greatly appreciated.  Well worth the price.  Highly recommended to others

I have been a long time user of Delorme Products but decided to get a combination of Microsoft products both for the US and Europe (Autotrip). 

The program loaded very smoothly, but do make sure you load the program before plugging in the GPS Locator.  There are multiple warnings about this as well as what to do if you don't follow directions.  I loaded all the data on my laptop so I would not have to carry the DVD.  

The setup was also quite simple.  There are warnings about usage in an automobile that pop up in use (as well as the cautions during setup).  One needs to keep this in mind and not be distracted when driving.  I set the mapping program and forget it.  But it works best with two people in the car with one to navigate.

The GPS locator has a great chipset.  Very, very sensitive and quickly finds the coordinates within seconds, even as I sit in my house.  It rarely loses a lock on the satellite.  

The route finding works well, so far.  You can save your track as well as the route, but unlike the Delorme products you can't playback your track (or if you can, I have not found it).  The screen is pleasing and you go fullscreen.  

I haven't tried voice recognition but the spoken commands are about average.  The ability ot overlay satellite photographs when planning routes with an internet connection is a plus.  Plus you can routinely update road construction sites.  So far, no opinion on how good that feature is.  

The Microsoft location finder internet leaves something to be desired though I've only tried it at home.  It routinely thinks I'm in China (which is interesting because so many ads are quite able to figure out where I am).  

The GPS also works with other programs by selecting a generic NEMA GPS.  There are other optional equipment to go with the GPS.  

If you've never used a GPS mapping program with a laptop, Microsoft S&T is a good choice.  Just don't be surprised if the GPS lcates you accurately and the Microsoft locator product puts you on the other side of the planet.

I do a lot of work out of town and in other states, so I am constantly in unfamiliar or different places. This GPS has saved me tons of time and within the next two months will probably have paid for its' self in saved mileage that I used to spend looking for places. I have recommended it to everyone that I have talked to. It's great, I will never have to Mapquest or ask for directions again. Another Great Microsoft Product

Connecting the cables was so easy I was sure I must have missed something.
Recording the music is equally easy.  Removing the snap crackle and pop was a snap.  My only confusion resulted in recording from 45rpms, I should have left them as stereo because it seems as though if you check off as mono, you can not remove the crackle and pop

This product does a superb job at converting audio cassette recordings to MP3 format on your computer or MP3 player.  You can adjust the audio level and pause the recording and advance the audio cassette if you need to do those things.  There are other automatic features to shut off, etc. It also can remove noise from the recording and clean up the transients

Xitel INport Deluxe does what it says it does.  You can plug in any RCA AUX connector into the unit and with the software provided you can record it in stereo to your computer.

It's a good solid product that does what it says it does but instead of focusing on the features like other reviewers I will point out its minor drawbacks. First, audacity, the a free software that is mentioned in the manual has a tendency to freeze up while recording with the unit.  However, I don't know if it will freeze up on your computer.  Second, if you are thinking about buying this product to turn LPs to CDs, into most LP players don't have RCA AUX plugs and you'll need to buy an addapter.  
(What they don't tell you in the manual is that if you do this you first need to adjust the volume on the stereo and recorder volume in parallel which is kinda tricky.) Finally, the manual could use more detail because some of the important features weren't mentioned.   

If you don't mind these drawbacks, you will be able to have many years of recording pleasure if you buy this product

I bought this to transfer LPs to CD. It is simple to connect to the computer, and the software is easy to use. Just be sure when you download  the MP3 encoding program,  to put it in the same directory as the LP ripper.
The LP recorder works  well and is very easy to use. The LP Ripper, makes it easy to trim the tracks, and then encode them as MP3 files. 
When saving them as MP3's I can get approximately 20 LP's on one CD.
I am very satisfied with the product

Product is excellent does what it says and then some.  Instruction for installation and operating are very easy to follow (a winner in my book).  I had issues unrelated to this product running into problems with the stereo I was using in the fact that it didn't have outputs for audio so I was forced to use the headphone jack which required further purchasing adapters for the RCA cable was a bit frustrating but had nothing to do with this product.  I converted 2 albums last night into wav files cleaned them up with the audio cleaner included in the software.  Used the editing ripper included to split the 1 recording into separate tracks, actually the software does that for you but you have the option to preview there start and ending points for each of the tracks in case it may be off. I only had minor adjustments the ripper was pretty much on the money, overall.  I then downloaded the encoder recommended to work with this software and converted the wav files into mp3's with no problem. This is an excellent buy for those out there looking to do there own audio transfer of lp's and cassettes.  The sound is excellent on playback.

This product is very easy to install and use. In couple of minutes, I was able to set it up. I used the phone jack to input the music from cassette player to the computer and it worked well. 
The reason I give it four star out of five is that it records the music in wave format and there is no software in the package that converts wave file to DVD/CD/MP3 format

INport, excellent job, I love the product and would highly recommend it to anyone.  I've had several hundred LPs sitting in boxes in the basement for years and now I'm rediscovering that music all over again as I transfer the LPs to the digital age.  

The quality of the transfer is very good (imo).  For example, I was playing back So. Central Rain (early REM) in ITunes and noticed that I had purchased the song on ITunes about a year ago.  Except for an opening click on the LP version, its very hard to tell the difference between the two.

My only minor negative (or really, feature request) would be for LPRipper to somehow integrate and automate song titles from the albums so that I don't have to type them all in.

I've only just started.  But so far, I am very pleased with this language program.  My only regret is that I don't have enough time to keep at it.  The various learning modalities are quite useful-this is the only program (aside from taking a class) that i've used which does this.  I recommend it

What I like about this software is that it does not come with too many "gadgets." At my age, I am "technically challenged." So this software worked out fine for me with my limited computer skills. I also like the fact that this software covers Castilian Spanish. It is probably the only course available that exclusively covers Castilian Spanish in such depth since Pimsleur and Learning Like Crazy only offer Latin American Spanish courses.  
The downside of this software is that you will not learn much Spanish grammar with it. If you want to learn the rules and mechanisms required to combine words and form sentences in Spanish, you will have to buy a good Spanish grammar book. For that I strongly recommend Spanish Grammar for Independent Learners by Avigail Azoulay, Arie Vicente. It is more expensive than other Spanish grammar books but it is well worth the money.

Streets and Trips has been a significant help in making our travel plans. We use it in conjunction with our Garmin 2720 GPS system and they are very complementary. The Garmin system doesn't use downloads from the laptop and Streets and Trips therefore allows us to do trip planning on a braosder scale at home. This is a very good program for trip planning

Although I did not purchase this product from Amazon.com (...), I absolutely love it.  The GPS locator provided is amazing and better than I thought it was.  It is not one of those GPS that updates your position every 20 seconds or something, but when I zoomed in I could see my current location constantly moving on the map (so it is updating every second)...I have ridden with deputies in my county as part of an internship and the GPS provided to them isn't even this good.  I recommend this software and GPS to anyone

I travel a lot; this product saves me valuable time in unfamiliar surroundings.  I have my laptop open on the seat and plot my position and where I want to go - it's easy!  If I miss a turn, the "reroute from present position" feature is great!  It takes a little getting used to, but if you tend to be more visual, or you don't generally do well with maps, or maybe you just want to know where you are in relation to where you're going -- MS Streets and Trips is tops

Used this for a trip from NW of Chicago to Houghton, MI (in the U.P.) and it worked fairly well except through some hilly sections (lost signal a few times). This works best when you have two people (driver and navigator) as looking over at a laptop while driving isn't a good thing! Would have been even better with voice prompts but at the price I wouldn't expect it

This is a cool game in a lot of ways.  I was jazzed about it because of the era it represents.  But the complexity and inscrutability of the setup menus is somewhat offputting.

The huge disapointment, however, is this:  The online registration code is missing.  Utterly missing.  And there is no resource available on the net to help.  The U.S.A. help number is disconnected.  You will not be able to play online.  Period.  The developer's forums are full of posts about this problem.  No resolution....  Beware.

Demand more of the makers of the products you purchase.  This is extremely bad

SimBin makes an excellent simulator. This game has brought me back to days days of yesteryear in great delight. The physics, sounds, and graphics are top notch. The game is fun and the ranks seriously tough. Online capabilities are fine except you have to unlock cars and tracks through the game, which could take weeks

I bought this product based on my research of users opinions and found it has lived up to their high opinions.  I have boxes of family photos as well as numerous camcorder tapes of family events.  I wanted an easy comprehensive program that would let me arrange photos and video clips, add music and burn on a DVD.  This program does it all and more.  It may not do everything extremely well, but for the price, well enough to put out an impressive DVD.  After about two hours of getting familiar with the program, I was able to create a DVD that had 35 pictures and a video clip with background music - stunning results.  I played the DVD on several different brands of DVD players and had no problems.  Looks great on TV.  I've had no problems running the program on my computer - I'm running this on a Pentium IV 2.9 GHz, 1 gig ram and 200 GB ram HD.  Since I am a beginner/weekend hobbyist, this suites my purpose of sharing pictures with family - I'm finding much better to share on DVD than paper photos.  For an all-in-one package at this price, it does the job very well and I would recommend it.

A great new interface including control layout, easier than ever to use, and complete. There is no other product in this class. It looks great in XP and even sharper in Vista.

Subject to some agreement with Adbobe, you'll have to download the free PDF writer from Microsoft (the beta came with it), but it works exactly the same and otherwise no suprises.

The product is pricey and you may want to purchase a smaller release (less applications in the suite) depending on your needs

I am a user of Acronis backup and very satisfied with it and was hoping that the Disk Director would be the same however it is a little more complicated to use, I partitioned a drive then wanted to convert back and have not yet be able to do so, I know that you can but just haven't found out how yet, it could have been made a little more simplier to use

The product does everything they claim save one. It won't work inside  Windows XP (service pack 2). But it will work when you boot from the disk. That isn't a problem in my view. Therefore I have no complaints

Excellent software to manage your large backup hard drives. You can format, partition, split, merge and a whole lot of other things. If you purchase a large backup hard drive I recommend this software and the Acronis True Image software. With both, you can partition your drive and have a ghost copy of your c:\ drive in one partition and daily backups of My Documents in another. This way in case of a HD crash you have a bootable backup. (Note that the software that comes with backup hard drives will not make a bootable backup of your hard drive.) Thats why I recommend both Acronis software packages

I am a Friends fan and I really enjoyed this game. The questions vary in difficulty, and the narration by the characters is a nice feature.

Regarding the issues with the keyboard, the keys for each player are indeed very close together. Also, when two players can answer the same question at the same time, it's easy to press the wrong key by mistake. But I guess in time you can get used to the keys.

I didn't have a problem installing the game, although I have a CD recorder and recording software installed. I didn't choose the full instalation, since the CD has to be in the drive anyway, but the game runs properly, it didn't seem to freeze when reading from the CD.

Compared to SceneIt, it's very different. This is a complete trivia game that keeps score and announces the winner. SceneIt is a board game, and the DVD is used to ask questions, and in order to play it as a trivia game you need to keep score with paper and pen

This DVD-Rom game is so interesting and there are even some questions that I don't know after watching every episode numerous times.  I highly recommend this for Friends fans of all ages, regardless of whether or not you have seen every episode.  Also, I love that the game can be played by only one person, for those nights that you find yourself alone and want a few Friends to keep you company

Love the program.... Hate the company!

I've been using QuickBooks for more than 10 years.  I started with the basic edition since I am a very small business and use only a portion of the program, specifically Customer and Vendor Lists, Invoicing, A/R and Purchase Orders.

OVERKILL is an understatement... QuickBooks Pro is much more powerful than I need.  I don't use Payroll, Check Printing, Year End Accounting and many of its other functions.  SO WHY DID I PURCHASE SUCH A POWERFUL PROGRAM?

That's the "rub".  Intuit is not satisfied with its QuickBooks users being content with the edition that they are using; Intuit sales people call all too frequently trying to get you to upgrade to the next higher version (edition) of their program.  They hounded me for years to upgrade from the early basic edition to the then current basic edition; finally, they dropped support of the product and I had no choice.  

I purchased QuickBooks 2005 Basic Edition in 2005.  Shortly after purchasing it, they informed me that they were no longer going to support the 2005 Basic Edition and if I wanted continued support I would have to upgrade again, this time to the Pro Edition.  

This January (2007) I received an email from Intuit informing me that my 2005 Basic Edition wouldn't run on the new Windows XP Vista platform and if I switched to Vista I would need to upgrade to QuickBooks Pro.  I upgraded to a new PC in February as the result of a major crash on my former system and opted to go with Vista, thinking that I could install Windows 98 as a second operating system to run QuickBooks 2005 Basic.  The second operating system didn't work out and, after seriously considering switching to Microsoft Accounting 2007, I purchased QuickBooks Pro.

I was very disappointed that Intuit didn't offer a significant purchase incentive to existing users; but they never have in all the years that I've been using their product.  Even Microsoft, the shark of sharks, offers incentives.  DON'T BE MISHEARTENED.

I purchased the program from Amazon and, with rebates and other purchase incentives, saved $60 over Intuit's price; I could have saved an additional $25 if I had bought on eBay (had I known it at the time).

I upgraded from the 2003 version with no major problems.  The 2007 version is a bit easier to use and works just fine for my small business. The security, however, is not great for a mid-sized company. Since my accountant fully supports the product, they are always available for support

I have used this product for over a year now.  The reason I bought it was for the back up software.  Email was a secondary consideration.  Let me talk about the back up for a moment.  It is quick to download and about that easy to start using.  The set up can be done in two ways.  Either by default, or manual.  I chose the default version which covers my home folders and it automatically backs up everything to my external hard drive at a time of my choosing.  It will also set up a seperate version of a back up of vital stuff to an online storage for you that you get when you buy .mac as well.  Restoring a lost file couldn't be easier.  just click on restore and the locate the file (or files) you want to restore.  The program is set up so that everything is named exactly as you originally named it on your hard drive.  You don't have to look for your file name in a long string of code.  Just select it and click restore.  It will either put it in the exact place of your old file or in new location of your choosing.   I haven't really messed with the other features yet, but the email is spam free and has been my default email for over a year now with out any problems.  Hope you buy the service and will enjoy it as much as I have

A couple of years ago, we completed the transition over to the Mac platform in our household.  Both my wife and myself have a desktop and a laptop, so leveraging the .Mac service to keep our personal configuration settings synchronized across computers has been fantastic.  Further, with the sharing features that are available, we each have access to view the other person's address book or calendar.  

One of the great features of the .Mac service is how it is tightly integrated into the operating system.  In addition, since the Synch Services capabilities in the operating system are documented and open, third party programs can write plug-ins that can leverage .Mac to propagate settings to different machines.

My favorite feature (and the catalyst for my initial subscription) is the Backup application.  As someone who has suffered the inconvenience of crashed hard disk drives far too many times, I wanted a simple, comprehensive, easy-to-use solution that I could use to backup my data to an external hard disk drive on a daily basis.  I've used other Mac-specific programs before and none are as easy to use as the Backup you get with .Mac.

The only real critique I have for the .Mac service is the amount of space available on the iDisk.  When services like Google Mail can offer 2.7GB of space for free (granted it is supported by advertising), it makes the .Mac the space available with .Mac seem meager.  Of course, considering a full backup of my data/settings takes up about 8GB of space, I may be outside of the demographic that the .Mac service is targeting.  However, in this age of digital media (pictures and movies), the amount of disk space people need for their "memories" is only going to go up.

But I guess that is why they have external drives and DVD burners

I have had .Mac for years and enjoyed using its functions.  I have a number of photo pages hosted as well as some iWeb sites.  Plus I use it for syncing and backup, etc.  I am not a power user, however.  But it's a great utility and particularly when you have other family members who you want to have access it some of its features easily.

High Fives to PaperPort 11 Pro!  Being in a business where I am constantly told to print this and print that off of one website and another,  a product like PaperPort Professional 11 has really come to my rescue.   The product has given the opportunity to do something with a document, picture, or file other than printing 

Now when I  select the document or file and hit my print option button,  I now can print it to a multi-page PDF,  If I choose to do so. Files that I download, scan, save, or  archive are no longer just random clutter on my hard drive,  I can retrieve the information from  them effortlessly using the product's powerful search engine.

I was thrilled to find that its All-In-One Search Engine was able to work with files generated in many MS Office applications.  All I needed to do was remember some of the content text and the PP Pro 11 would find the file for me.

Now I'm stacking individual MS Office Files into logically-named PDF groups or using the product to search the web and retrieve information of interest, I find  PP Pro 11 to be well worth the money and my time to use it.

I read horror storied about 7.0 Nero so I upgraded to 6.6 from 5.5 by going to the Amazon new & used market.  This is a good program that does all you need for DVD's and CD's.  It gets good reviews.  I can't imagine what happened to 7.0 but they may have gotten carried away with "user friendly-ness" - I see a little of that in 6.6 compared to 5.5

6.6 Ultra is an extremely good CD/DVD burning suite.  It even has an excellent schedule-able backup/restore utility that burns to disk.
Do NOT use the OEM version - it's like diet Nero.  And do NOT for ANY reason get Nero 7.0.  You have less than a 50% chance that it will work at all.  (I am speaking from experience here!

Nero 6 is a wonderful product, but you need to get a legal copy of the full retail version, not an OEM CD or a CD of questionable origin. At this time (April 2006) the best place to get it is from the Ahead Software website (the makers of Nero). (You can get a retail box of Nero 7 just about anywhere, but Nero 6.6 seems to be more stable and provides all the functionality most users will need.) You can download a demo, then purchase a serial number to unlock the full product. It's a smooth, easy transaction. After many headaches I discovered that the OEM version that came with my DVD burner would allow me to capture video from my camcorder, but wouldn't let me burn them to DVDs. My choice was to either buy a CD of questionable origin (and one that is almost certifiably illegal) on eBay, purchase a DVD burning plug-in from Ahead Software for $24.99, or purchase the whole suite for $80.00. I chose the latter. Using my installed OEM version, I purchased the serial number, entered it into the product (very easy to do), then downloaded the latest updates, and I was off and running. This software produces very high quality DVDs and can burn a disk in 15 to 20 minutes using an inexpensive 16x NEC DVD burner. I am now a happy consumer with a stack of DVDs containing transferred videos of great quality

As a retired teacher, I wanted the ability to compose a song and share it in a pristine form.  Finale SongWriter does that.  The lyrics find their way to the correct note.  The Midi connection works and all the parts of a composition is enveloped in this software. One of the attractions for me is the cost.  Finale SongWriter does not extract your final dollar from your stash.  Try this program, and you will find many facets hidden that makes Finale SongWriter a positive

Look, notation software is notoriously expensive.  All musicians know that.  So, when you see SongWriter and its price, it's a relief.  Everything you need is in this program.  I only have one complaint.

When adding an expressive dynamic (p,mp,mf,f,ff,etc.) you have to add one to EACH note to insure proper playback.  That is a concern of mine since I use SongWriter to notate songs and export them in MIDI for recording purposes.  It leaves an ugly looking score.

Other than that, this is the best deal on the market for what it is

I got a hold of a Windows Vista Ultimate disk.  It gave the choice to install Home Basic, Home Premium, Business, or Ultimate.  I installed Vista Home Basic, because I only have 512 MB of RAM. 

Likes:
I like the new wallpapers and the way it looks.  My Documents and My Music folder remind me of iTunes.

Dislikes:
Don't like that my less than 6 month old HP printer doesn't work with Vista and my USB net link cable doesn't work with Vista.  When you install something screen slowly fades out and then a window comes up asking you if you want to run the program and trust it.  It's a little annoying because it forces you to stop what your doing and answer the question before you can continue.  

Verdict:
I like it, but the incompatibility issues are enough for me to want to stick with XP. I wouldn't buy Home Basic.  If you really want Vista, buy a new computer with Vista preinstalled or install a trial version of Vista to make sure everything works.  I'm going back to XP, until HP releases Vista drivers for my printer.

I'll write reviews on Home Premium, Business, and/or Ultimate if I ever get more RAM.

Some existing programs, such as Norton System Works, are not compatible with Vista and Norton insists that you pay for an upgrade to the 2007 version. Other than the compatibility issue, Windows Vista Home Basic works fine for me.

At home, I've been a Mac user since 1991. I also have been something of a Linux fanatic too and have used several distros, mostly Red Hat and now Fedora Core. At work, however I have used MS-DOS, Windows 3.11, 95, 98 and XP. It's fair to say I have never liked Microsoft. But on a laptop I use at work (an older Gateway 400VTX with a 2.2GHz Intel Celeron), I just upgraded to Vista Home Basic. I also upgraded the memory to its maximum 1GB. And despite my years of eschewing Microsoft, guess what? I must say I really like the OS. It runs fine on my slower system and I had no problems installing and no conflicts with drivers. 

I think Microsoft has really made a "cool" OS

I was hesistant to upgrade to vista for a while but I decided to invest and see what the hype was all about. I have a P4 HT 3.0 Ghz with a good video card and after upgrading my current desktop to 2 GB of ram, I found that vista runs really well on my machine. I bought the home basic because microsoft advised it and I dont need any of the other features offered in premium. I love the graphic capabilities of vista and the functionality is really nice. I had no problems using any of my programs and had to only upgrade my video and sound drivers after installation. Vista installed all of my updated device drivers for me as well. This is definitely a solid OS and I would highly recommend upgrading to vista if you have the recommended hardware requirements

I have been using McAfee products for the last 7 years. I did not have any problems with viruses, but it is true, I try to stay out of dubious web sites. I purchase my McAfee software from Amazon every year because of their rebates and every time I see 1 - 2 star ratings. It is unfair. Their products are excellent.

I have installed McAfee Internet Security Suite 2007 on two computers so far. The first one is a Dell laptop. I unistalled the previous 2006 edition and Ad-Aware (since Ad-Aware and the 2007 ed. are incompatible) and the installation was perfect. Not the least problem.

I ran into problems though with my desktop. I have tried to remove the 2006 edition and I could not find a remove button in Windows' Add/Remove Progrmas. I poped the 2007 ed. in and it said that it will remove the old products automatically. After the instalation the Firewall did not work. I noticed that somehow the old 2006 ed. was still there. I went to McAfee's web site and I got a removal utility that got rid of all McAfee products on my computer. Another great tool I used off of their web site was "Virtual Technician" which told me that the entire installation was messed up. However, after cleaning up with the other utility I did a fresh installation and everything works perfectly.

It took me a few hours to get a hold of the problem, yet I love to play with computers.

McAfee should not be hold accountable for a product that performs excellent in normal conditions. I continue to trust McAfee's products.

I love the cleaning utility. It is very thorough. I plan to use it every day before visiting banking and financial sites. It cleans all of your internet traces.

It takes a while until you get used to where all the tools and settings are placed, yet any new complex bundle of software would present you with the same challange.

I hope that the 2008 edition will have the anonymizer built in. It would be a great tool.

In the end, protection is what it matters, and McAfee Virus Scan and Personal Firewall have done it for me for the last 7 years

I am an adult trying to learn Piano.  This program is great for learning simple songs and does have a very good feedback system.
The lessons are taught with plenty of simple songs which you can play and the feedback system will track how well you play.  The feedback system tracks your key presses, rythem, and note length.  However, it does not track the strength of your key press.
I would like to see more exercises to develop better basic skills, instead of just playing simple songs.  Also, the feedback program can be very discouraging for children as it is very sensitive and report very minor error.
Overall, this is still a great program to have for self learner, but in no way will it beat a real piano teacher

I received my eMedia Piano and Keyboard Method today and it's not a bad program by any means, however I have two gripes with the software: 

First, either the "full screen" option in Preferences doesn't work or eMedia feels that 640x480 counts as a full screen, so if you have your monitor set at a higher resolution (and what Mac user doesn't?) you'll need to lower it in order to read the lessons' text, and since you most likely won't be sitting as close to your laptop/monitor during these lessons, this is kind of important. 

Second, You need to have the program CD in your computer to get the sound and video to play, and the whine of my optical drive is mildly annoying while trying to study/practice. There are workarounds to bypass this type of copyright protection silliness, but it makes me mad that I need to resort to doing this. If eMedia's so paranoid about theft of their product, why don't they just stream the program's media portion from their website?  At least it wouldn't be noisy that way.

Other than these two flaws, the program is excellent for self-starters like me. Plus it seems to be the only complete, low-cost piano/keyboard instruction software out there for Mac OSX. I would have wrote this review after a few weeks of lessons instead of my first day learning but the optical-drive issue really bothered me.

I thought that I could never learn piano on my own. All the material that I ever looked into either didn't have enough information in it or was too complicated for its own good. Because of this software, I am constantly learning new things, and slowly improving my skills as a future pianist. If you are a beginner, you want to buy this software. It's done wonders for me

Great resource.  Best parts are the chapters with the lessons on what the threats are and how they can specifically hurt you.  You can't protect yourself from something without knowing what it can do to you and how it works

This CD is a MUST HAVE! You cannot afford to NOT buy it. The information is comprehensive and easy to follow. The format is perfectly set up... you can review a section many times if needed. Every family and individual in America should view this CD to know what to do when a terrorist attack occurs... not IF, but WHEN, it occurs. For instance, before watching this CD I had no idea you could use regular household items like dish soap or bleach to remove radioactive materials from your skin, but these items will make chemical burns worse. I feel much better having this knowledge from the CD, and this is just one example of the useful and critical information I learned. The preparation checklists on the CD are awesome for planning ahead. Knowledge will be powerful in protecting yourself and your family in the event of another attack

I'm an amateur at website design/building, so understand that I'm not very "deep" in Dreamweaver's abilities. However, I got the program to switch from Adobe GoLive CS2 which had many quirks, bugs, and frustrations. (One example - while you upload your changed files to the web server in GoLive, you can't do anything else in the program. Single tasking!?!?!) After just 30 minutes or so of working with Dreamweaver to update my site, I'm already sure I've made the right decision! I have a long way to go in learning what it can do, but my first impressions of the product are excellent

I'm new to web design.  I've tried other products, including Frontpage, and found them too cumbersome to use and the results were not what I wanted.  Dreamweaver is the best. Easy to use, with more tools to make your web pages look great, even for a beginner.  And there is a lot of support and tutorials on the web to help you out

I'm a hobbyist musician and like to do home recordings. This program fits all of my basic needs. This is the first piece of audio software I've ever owned but I know a lot of people who are more experienced are very unhappy with what I guess are unconventional layouts and commands so be warned if you've used Audition 1.5 or CoolEdit. However, as my introduction to music editing, the control scheme seems very intuitive to me and I like the endless options Adobe provides for organizing the workspace. One tip: if you are a student or teacher, don't spend $300; do a google search and find a site that sells this product for a little over $100.

QuickBooks lives up to it's reputation of being the one-size-fits-all small business book keeping software.  It does what you want it to do.  I like the feature of being able to easily sent e-mail invoices.  If you need the software right away it is just as cheap at the office supply stores

I became interested in this after trying a more advanced program for my business. After weeding through too many option that didn't apply, I knew I just needed somthing simple-- a good way to monitor money in, money out. This program is simple and easy to adjust if you make a mistake.  I highly recommend it, as it is exactly as described

I am satisfied with the product.  For that matter I know it before I bought and I am satisfied with it.  The only glitch is it will take some time to start and until it starts we may not be able to browse or use any applications that needs internet.  Still I would suggest it is a best option to buy one for ur computer safety

Over all I am very happy with the product. It has paid for itself in this short time by just making Happy Birthday cards. I am not totally happy with the product and I am not sure if I would buy it again. The product is well worth the money you are paying but their is a few things which I am not happy about: 
1. Even though the product gives you CD's which contain Art and Project Models their is more art and projects on the Internet. To access these art and projects you need to go on the Internet which is not a problem. What is a problem is that if you want to get on this site and a lot of other people are on the site already you may not be able to get on the site. If you cannot get on the site you cannot finish your project. You will have to put it away until some other time when you can get on the site. This is frustrating and annoying. It makes you want to take the entire program and through it out the window and buy another brand.
2. The other thing I was not happy about was, I was given a coupon, in the box, for a 1 year membership to the "Million Image Club" To get into this club you have to fill out some paperwork and submit it on the Internet. After it is reviewed you are then sent a pass word, over the Internet, that allows you to go on the site. Well, I filled out all the paperwork, sent it in over the Internet, as required, but was not sent a password. Well, I tried to find some one to talk to about this but ran into a brick wall after spending a lot of time being directed from one site to another only to end up with no answer to the problem. It seems that Broderbund does not control the product but "Encore" does. You will receive almost no help at all from "Encore". The only place to get help is from a Forum which couldn't give a reasonable answer on what I should do. So, I am now not getting access to the "Million Image Club", to tell you the truth, I don't really care. When you finally can get on the site you have hundreds of images and models to choose from. You really don't need a million more.

I have been using Printmaster Platinun for several years and love it. I scrapbook constantly using all of the features. I have printed thousands of items with this program. If  people have problems with the program it is because it uses alot of memory and the problem is their computer.  I have gotten rid of 10 scrapbook, photo programs and only use Printmaster. There is no better program.  Ann

I chose Office Ultimate 2007 as it seemed to not only have everything I could possibly need to run a business, but also easy functionality that would keep me from pulling my hair out because of software or design issues.

Ultimate 2007 certainly doesn't disappoint!  

- Set up was fairly easy:  two disks came with the package.  Disk One contains most of the software and Disk Two contains applications that guarantee that you are the owner of the software and have the right to all of the Accounting and key business functions.  

- Ribbon technology removes the old "hunt and find" menu method (although for those of us that took the time to memorize and learn the location of every buttom and drop-down it did take a day or two to get used to the new set up).  

- Integration with the web and other programs is virtually seemless.

- Excel is no longer the chore it once was because of the above mentioned ribbon.

- Accounting software is included.

- Ink and Crossword.  I'm not one for games on my business pc, but for anyone that likes to doodle or zone out with crosswords, ULTIMATE lives up to its name by including an art program designed for pen users and excellent crosswords.  

- OneNote.  I like post-its (perhaps a little too much *L*) and always used the Post-It Note software on my business computer to keep notes.  I used OneNote 2003 sparingly because I simply found the Post-It Note software easier to use on my desktop, BUT...with my Tablet PC One Note 2007 added a new dimension to my notetaking that I feel will work well with my business:  the earlier mentioned web and application integration and handwriting to text functionality.  I may still use Post-It now and then for quick notes or perhaps the Windows "Stickys," but the long note pages, pasting of images and other web info, and pen to paper note taking makes this product invaluable.

- Word.  What can I say?  This is my primary software tool and I use it on a tablet pc.  The 2007 applications were made for my computer type.  I can easily click on formatting tools with the touch of my Wacom pen and I don't have to stop mid-thought to make a change or wait until I finish the document to then make my edits.

- PowerPoint, Publisher, Access, Groove, InfoPath et cetera (also included): I am still delving into these, but they appear to have all of the perks of the other programs.

So, did I have any dislikes?  

1.  The INK program doesn't respond to my Wacom pen as well as the Windows journal or Microsoft OneNote.  It also doesn't have easy to use tools within the software. Since it was an "extra" and will not be my primary desktop publishing, design, or art tool - I'll probably remove it at some point from my tablet. 
2.  Microsoft does not include an instruction manual or reference book with this program.  As a result, after installation of the first disk and Microsoft's statement that all of my programs were installed, I couldn't find my Accounting software, had no idea that the Accounting software was on the second disk (the second disk, when loaded, doesn't mention that the software is on the disk until AFTER the software installation is complete and instead mentions other business applications), and wasted over an hour trying to find it.  Also, I'm a "hands on" person and although I have access to the internet whenever I need it, I enjoy having an actual book in my hands from time-to-time while learning.  Ultimate is made with enough simplicity that a manual isn't really necessary (i.e. most questions can be answered by the "Help" window), BUT...for the hefty price tag, I don't think it would have been too much to ask Microsoft to include a basic "this is how you install the programs and this is what to expect" booklet. Also note:  athough Microsoft, through their downloads e-mail updates, provided a "Getting Started" tab with a "how-to" for each major software applications, the tabs had to be added "after the fact" and many of you might find yourselves frustrated with the lack of upfront instructions on how to use the software.

Beside those few quirks, I fully stand behind my 5 star rating of this product and purchasing this product through Amazon (i.e. Amazon's pricing was less than the big boy retailers or online vendors).  

Shipping turnaround with Super Saver:  2 days.

For the first time in several versions Microsoft has changed the file format.  However, it is for the better.  The new files are all compressed using the ZIP compression format so files are MUCH smaller (old files are 3-4 times larger than new files).  The new file formats are supposed to be compatible with a cross platform specification (i.e. Linux geeks can open Office documents).

The new interface is RADICALLY different.  Do not install this if you have a large project to complete.  The interface is SO different you will not complete on time.  However, after a month of so you will wonder how you ever got along without it

Having used the Office programs for some time, I was a bit put off by the new ribbons which replace the old menus.  I guess that Office needed a new look, but I am not sure if I buy the advertising that the ribbon will make my work more productive.  

Some things that you should know about Office 2007 and Ultimate in general.  The licensing agreement allows you to install Office 2007 Ultimate on two computers, one of them being a laptop.  I found this clause in the legal agreement and even called Microsoft Legal to confirm.  

If you make modifications to the Quick Access Toolbar (and who won't do that?) and you want to take these changes with you to another computer, the files for the toolbars are located at:

C:\Documents and Settings\username\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Office

Where username is your username.  Something I have found handy when working with my two computers.

One thing that I don't like is that the file name extensions have changed.  Gone is the familiar .doc for Word documents.  Now the file extension is .docx.  If you want to create a document that can still be opened by prior versions of Word, you must purposefully choose to create a .doc file, but you lose some of the functionality of the new files.  The .docx file This format is not the same as the OpenDocument standard.  Microsoft promises that older versions of Word can still open the .docx files, but I have not tried it and I don't buy into everything that Microsoft promises until I see it happen.  Why couldn't Microsoft just leave the files the same as they have always been?

Office 2007 does look slick and I anticipate that I will warm up to it in the future as I get used to the new command structure.

Microsoft Office Ultimate 2007 is fairly good once you know how to use it. It is a a little difficult if you are new to how the menus work but once you know how they work it is fairly simple to use

I read the review centering on the box the DVD comes in and must admit that I was stumped as well.  It was "different" but I don't foresee this as being a problem overall.

The new Office Ultimate 2007 loaded quickly.  How quickly?  Well, I had to check my new Vista HP notebook because I couldn't believe that it packed all of the programs onto the system in such a short amount of time.  It asked for the Product Key and one or two other bits of data but that was it.  Out of all the Office suites I have owned, this one loaded so quickly I was sure there was a problem.  Nope.  Access, Outlook, Word, PowerPoint, Publisher, OneNote, Excel, Groove and a host of others were there ready to be activated (don't worry; you only do it once, not for each separate program.  Naturally, if you are like me and totally dependent upon email, you'll activate Outlook first).  

The new Office "feels" different.  The ribbons are OK but I would suggest that they allow us the option to retain the Classic (XP) view.  I rely quite a bit on the RESEARCH task pane and I don't mind telling you that it was difficult to find.  The menu bar is a bit on the thin side and having so many icons on the top added clutter and confusion, at least for me.  Of course, finding the research task pane could have been quickly resolved if Microsoft had put a product manual in the box (yes, the online HELP is nifty but sometimes a man just needs to read about it from a manual instead of printing it out).

All in all you will find all of your old favorites.  And, true to the Office legacy, they really have not changed enough to warrant a major release but I'm willing to bet that after all is said and done, Office Ultimatae 2007 will become the industry standard

I'm a PC mechanic. I have been using Ad-Aware with Ad-Watch (now called Ad-Aware Plus) for the last 5 years.  It's pretty good at what it does, but there is newer technology that is going to replace it soon.
I've never had any problems with these program - it does NOT add any malware - it REMOVES it.
However, using Ad-Aware and Ad-Watch to their fullest does take some computer savvy - as it seems does any anti-malware on the market these days.
ALL of the other runtime problems the other reviewers here have reported are "fixable" by using the controls and tweaks in the software, so that you are not overprotecting your system - one example, the pop-up blocker in Ad-Watch is adjustable as to its intensity.  However, this requires changing TWO settings - one in Ad-Watch itself and one in Ad-Aware.
  
And, yes, at times, I have had to turn Ad-Watch off to download a file or see a popup I wanted.  Soooo?  Software these days is not as "automatic" as the companies would have you believe.  

If you're not willing to take the time to learn (which also means going to the company's online user forums and asking questions), just stick with what Windows offers, don't use Outlook or Outlook Express (major source of malware on PCs) and only look at websites you know are safe.  (Kinda like the safest form of sex is abstinence - the safest form of surfing is NONE!!!

For more than a year now, I have been using Ad-Aware. I love it. The program scans for spyware, adware, hijackers, keyloggers, and common trojans (but Norton is the one that takes out the trojans).

So far, I am happy with this product. Even though I have never had anything bad on my computer (just cookies...mmm, cookies), my friend sure has had his share with MiniBug, Axela, eZula, FunWebProducts, and some others, and Ad-Aware completely removes it. And it does it all for free (yes, you can get the personal version free at Lavasoft's website).

So what's something that Ad-Aware Personal doesn't do? Real-time. You'll notice on the personal version that if you click on Ad-Watch to enable Real-Time, it will state "Realtime protection not avaliable in the personal edition.". So, I checked out the plus edition.

So, I did a test on an old computer, and installed eZula. That's right, it didn't go through. Right when it reached, an Ad-Aware pop-up stated "eZula was found at C:/(whatever). Would you like to remove?". Wow! Amazing!

One thing that is doesn't do is block most pop-ups. This is dissappointing, mainly because competetors like SuperAdBlocker/SuperAntiSpyware has a great pop-up blocker along with everything Ad-Aware has. But, SuperAdBlocker doesn't have real-time, and Ad-Aware does. I'd recommend getting both.

For now, if the computer is in a school, hotel, or airport of such, getting the plus edition wouldn't be a bad idea. But if you just use it for home, just keep the free personal edition. There aren't that many spyware programs that do things virus do, but I HAVE SEEN SOME that restart computers and add odd programs, such things trojans do. Though, for now, if you're not using this for public use, just have Ad-Aware Personal SE. If this is for public use, this is a great idea, and you may also want to get SuperAdBlocker for extra spyware protection and an excellent advertisement blocker (hell, now that I think of it, even if you have adware and SuperAdBlocker, it will block the adware), and Norton or McAfee for viruses or trojans (actally, every computer needs Norton or McAfee, unless it's a Mac or something).

As for Ad-Aware, it's an excellent program, and it's highly recommended. Maybe in feature editions, maybe well see a pop-up/banner/flash blocker that SuperAdBlocker/SuperAntiSpyware has

Don't get confused by the licensing mumbo jumbo that comes on the package. It is the full version ready to be installed. Don't forget to plan out your disk partitioning strategy before you start. So far, I have not noticed a dime's worth of difference from the Pro version. It is working great.

However, the Vista coupon shipped with my package expired on March 15, 2007. Additionally, the coupon only applied to new systems purchased between October 26, 2006 and March 15, 2007, so don't let the Vista thing induce you

Don't listen to all that crap about how you should get Linux or buy a Mac instead of buying Windows. That will probably be the dumbest choice in your life. This is the full version of windows OEM software. Comes with activation code and Vista upgrade coupon to either Vista Home Basic or Home Premium. Bought from Tiger Direct through amazon.

When I tried this program out, I at first had some trouble running it. But Then I went to the website at: www.kutoka.com and click on the support tab and then select EasySpeak Spanish. They give you a link for the version of Flash 8 you need to run. After this everything worked well.

While some may have been offended by bathing suits. Not me and not my kids. There is absolutly nothing obscene here folks. 

This program is the best thing going for learning spanish quickly! And it is fun to use with the many games and puzzles that you work out with real life scenerios. Very artistic and fun. You can go to the bank, the hospital, and several different places, learn a new set of words and situations. that you could really use in a foreign country. My hats off to the designers and creators of this program. Well done!! Bravo! Muy Bien.

This product is amazing. After learning my husband was taking me to Mexico for our 25th anniversary, I was nervous about going into a foreign country without knowing any Spanish. This game is amazing. It is the fastest way to learn a language without the long drawn out grammar explanations. Afterall, I just wanted to learn the basics, phrases for restaurants, banks, airports, shopping etc. This game was so much fun, you couldn't tear me or my husband off the computer. We kept wanting to play because learning was so much fun. The phrases I learned contributed to a much more enjoyable trip and now I have enrolled at the local community college to further my Spanish. This product is perfect for any one travelling and wanting to learn the phrases and colloquial expression fast

What a wonderful game - addictive and motivating! If you want to be able to make original sentences, you might need something more in depth with a bit more grammar, but for "Eazy Speak" this is right on the target! Fun for any computer user!

I have not yet looked at all the documents included in this software. I appreciate the tutorial nature and the pro/con examples given. Since I am not a lawyer, I am a bit nervous about making legal decisions that would need a test in court to be sure I made the correct choices. I did complete the HealthCare Directive and it compares well with others I've seen used in my state. I need to learn more about estate planning and this is going to teach me the jargon and the proper questions to ask.

My only complaint is that I declined the free delivery option and paid for delivery so I would have enough time to work with it before my parents appointment with their estate attorney.  It did not arrive in a timely manner and I was forced to purchase a download version from another vendor in order to complete forms I wanted the attorney to look at.  It is no surprize that he was more interested in drawing up his own forms for my parents and charging $1000 for a basic package.

I decided to keep the CD anyway (when it finally arrived) just in case I have a hard drive failure.

The lawsuit mentioned in Mr John Matlock "Gunny" review has nothing to do with the quality or legality of documents created using Quicken WillMaker Plus software. Instead, it concerns the actions of an insurance agent who was found to have practiced law without a license. 

He used will-making software (not Quicken WillMaker Plus) to write a will
for an elderly client. The trouble arose because he created the will outside of her presence and arranged for her to sign it while she was hospitalized. Apparently she never reviewed the will. In other words, he acted too much like a lawyer. While the "unauthorized practice of law" is a vague concept, had the insurance agent merely recorded the woman's wishes and entered them verbatim into the software, there would almost certainly have been no problem.

There is no problem with using software to prepare a will for your self. Nor is there a problem with using it to create a will for someone else if you merely type in that person's answers at their direction. The main way to run afoul of unauthorized-practice-of-law rules is to give legal advice to or prepare documents for others without their express, detailed instructions.

There are several real advantages to using Quicken Willmaker software. 

1. The legal part of the software was done by Nolo. They publish an awful lot of do-it-yourself software, and are well respected (if you are not a lawyer). Nolos involvement helps to assure me of a quality product. 

2. The user interface, a fill in the blank approach with a lot of help screens, make the whole process quite easy and painless to go through. 

3. Besides the standard last will, the package includes a number of other documents that you may want decide you need. Among others this includes Living Trust, Living Will, Final Arrangements, Notice to Terminate Joint Credit Card Accounts, Child Care Agreement & instructions, and many more. 

Having said that, there are two problems with the software: 

1. If you live in Louisiana, your laws are based on the French system, not the English system and there is a caution on the box that says: 'Estate planning documents not valid in Louisiana.' 

2. There has been at least one law suit saying that if you fill out the will for another person, you may be practicing law without a license. Do a Google search on 'Heirs sue over will-making software' where someone apparently used this software to do a will for a lady.

I just used this program to make wills and healthcare directives for my wife and me. I have the book-CD version. I recommend it over just the CD, because it is a better financial deal, and you do not have to read a PDF online or print it out.
Here are some of the features that I thought were worth noting:
* The program divides a document into sections and shows you a list of those sections, indicating which sections you have done. You can resume the interview at the beginning of any section and make changes from that point on.
* After doing one will, you can go to the File menu and Save for Spouse. This creates a copy of the will with the spouses names interchanged. Then you can go through the interview and make any needed changes.
* In the process of answering the questions, the program accumulates the names of people you mention into an editable contact list. After you mention someone once, the next time you need them you can simply select them from a list. This is handy when doing the healthcare directive, which needs to show contact information, if you have already entered that information when doing the will. It is also handy if you decide to redo portions of either document. When working on one family member's document, you can import contacts from another's document.
* The program does not appear to provide the option to list of two or more alternate executors to serve one at a time in the order named. The only way to list two or more alternate executors is to have two or more of them serve together. This is ironic, since the program recommends having only one executor at a time. Although I wanted to name my wife, children, and then siblings as alternate executors, I decided to accept just having my wife and son as executor and alternate. If all of us die in an auto accident while taking a trip together, then there is hopefully time for the probate court to name an executor. It would just be more expedient to have one already named.
* I contacted customer support asking them to enhance the program to add an option to list of two or more alternate executors to serve one at a time in the order named. The response stated why they chose to omit that option ("The editors choose to limit the number of fields for Beneficiaries and Executors to prevent the program from becoming to unwieldy") and some options (export the document and add the language or return the program). I was disappointed that they did not embrace my suggestion (I disagreed that it would make the program too unwieldy, since they already allow you to list multiple Beneficiaries and Executors that serve together at the same time), but I liked that I received a prompt response that indicated they had read my note and knew what I was talking about, and that they gave an honest, direct answer.
* At the end of the interview you can review the document as it will print. You can then print it directly to a printer, or export it as plain text or RTF. Exporting to RTF is handy if you need to change the document (they advise against changing it) or print it somewhere else. However, the RTF is not identical to printing directly. I noticed two differences. (1) Pagination can be different, and as explained by the program, getting the pagination right is important for legal reasons. (2) The footer is always different: the directly printed copy says how many total pages, whereas the RTF one does not. If you cannot print directly to a printer, I recommend printing to a PDF to maintain the pagination and other features. If you do not have a way to create a PDF, get a free PDF Writer (search on that term). When you print the document to PDF, print it as prepress so you embed the fonts.

I was using other internet security programs in the past. All had their pros and cons. I decided to switch to PC-Cillin 2006 Home Security Pack and it is the best available!.  It has both virus and spyware protections built in. The scanning is quick and the updates are easy to get. Plus this home security 3 pack is able to be installed on 3 computers, a bargain. All in all I am sold on this easy to use and comprehensive software product. I highly recommend this product to all! Amazon.com as usual had the best price

First I would like to state that sooner or later every computer
user will come in contact with some problem with an Internet
Security program. They are human made and not 100% fault proof.

I study and work in the IT field and was first introduced to
PC-cillin through Trend Micro's product Housecall. Soon after I
tried out the trial and have finally bought the product. I LOVE
IT!

I have used several of the other "major" anti-virus suites
available and have had tons of problems with them. McAfee after
one uninstall had bedded itself so far into the computer that I
had to completely reformat the PC to gain functionality again.
Norton to say wasn't much better.

If you are installing on a "clean" PC where these other software
suites have not been, I have not had a problem. I have
installed/uninstalled PC-cillin many times each time running
smoothly.

The software has been a valuable asset protecting my PCs by
alerting me to virus threats and even hacking threats that were
not even on my network but on my ISPs network. As well as
protecting my network from one single computer that received a
virus by shutting off traffic to that PC. 

I can understand where some of the other problems reported with
this software may occur if the person a beginning user or just
unfamiliar with the framework of the software. But if you already
have some experience in how to set this type of software up I
really do recommend you give PC-cillin a try. 

It is a sleak program, easy to install, easy to customize, and
really goes above and beyond with alerting you to possible risks
and threats. 

With all its competitors out there I would choose PC-cillin over
the rest any day of the week

I've used several other protection packages over the years and am please to say that last year found trend micro.  Their internet protection is imho the best.  Easy to install, doesn't eat up system resources, updates regularly, doesn't conflict with other programs.

I had to start version 9 without the user files from version 7.  Even without the user files version 9 more quickly adapts to my needs.  I can dictate faster and there are fewer mistakes.  This reduces the time it requires for me to write a letter or produce a document.  For these reasons I'm quite satisfied with the purchase

This is a perfect office suite for those who don't need all the new stuff that is available in office 2007. Outlook appears to be working great without some of the hang-ups in earlier additions. Probably more stuff in here than most people need, but it is easy to use and has some great enhancements

Microsoft Office Pro 2003 edition is a good product. It installed easily over Office Pro 1997. I haven't had any problems with it (yet). It relies heavily on online links, you probably should have a fast DSL connection or broadband if you are going to use the online links.
Update:
I am using Windows XP with Office Pro 2003 and today was disappointed to find that the Help menu is not as user friendly or helpful as earlier editions

I was happy enough with the function of Office XP, and held off upgrading for a long time.  What pushed me over was when I switched to using Outlook as my email client, accessing quite a few POP3 email accounts for various websites.  Getting a spam filter to work smoothly under that circumstance was nasty: I spent many hours in addition to the fees for programs that were clunky and could never be kept working.

Well, Office 2003's Outlook comes with it's own spam filter.  It works, it's simple and it's unobtrusive.

The other programs have a nicer look and a few bells and whistles, but the upgrades I appreciate most are in Outlook

I love this especially for it's basic qualities.  I originally started with the version where it could be put on a 1.44 floppy that I got from my dentist, went to version 2001 a few years later. With version 2001 my bank no longer would support downloads for that it, and I knew I would have to upgrade some time.  I was comfortable with 2001 so I was glad to find this 2007 was easy to adapt to just a bit sleeker but adding my ability to download from my bank once again.  For someone who doesn't have the need for all the extras this is perfect

(Review written by my wife, the user.)
I've happily used the Quicken Checkbook program for many years.  When we changed operating systems from Windows XP to Windows Vista, I was unable to get the Quicken 2002 version to work in Vista, so I purchased Quicken Basic 2007 and am totally pleased with the program.  The only feature I use is the Checkbook program and as far as I'm concerned, it's perfect.  I've never used the download from bank option because I prefer to review all posted transactions when the bank statement arrives. I use Edit Preferences feature to tailor the program to my liking and I couldn't be happier.  The price is reasonable, too

If you find iMovie complicated, this product is not for you.  If you prefer automatic quick solutions this product may not be for you.  

If you find that you would like more control of your video/audio than you find in iMovie but don't want to spend a lot of money, boy have you come to the right place.

I take quite a lot of home video (new baby and all) and found that iMovie would frustrate me when I couldn't do some more advanced tasks.

iMovie is a great intro product.  If you are new to video, use it until you find that you feel limited (many will never will get to that point).

When (and if) you find that you feel some constraints in iMovie, then move up to FCE.

A note for most, iMovie and FCE typically are not for DVD/Hard Drive camcorders.  They don't have the output necessary to directly connect.  You may want to check with your camcorder manufacturer to see what they have to convert the DVD/HD to content that is usuable in these products

I use this with a MacBook laptop with 2GB RAM without any performance issues. It is a great product for when you have outgrown iMovie but don't need the full feature set of Final Cut. I use it for both perosnal and work video production. No problems connecting and moving video of a Panasonic PV-GS500 video camera via Firewire. There is a learning curve but the basics are pretty easy to master.

This was given to my son who is going to be living in China this summer and presently knows no Chinese.  He's worked hard with this program and at least appears to be getting the tonal quality correct which is key in this language.  A microphone is a must with this program.  Only wish it focused on certain key words other than phrases that would never be used, like "an old man driving a car"

This map and trip maker is about the same as their previous versions except to my dislike, it no longer supports Windows 98, which happens to be the newest OP that my old lap top can use.  It also still lists some restaurants that have been closed for two years.  The street maps it produces are accurate, except for a few minor glitches

The program is great.  Sometimes the GPS is slightly off though.  I'll be travelling on a major highway and all of the sudden it will tell me that I'm off route for no reason.  Not really a big deal, just annoying.  Other than that I recommend it as a cheaper version of a GPS sysytem if you own a laptop

This is the second generation of this software I have owned.  It is a great navagation tool, better than most online sites and can be used in the car.
I marvel at how up to date the roads shown are because in the Lexington, Kentucky area we have had a lot of new growth, with new streets and roads.
The software contains a lot of good eating and lodging places already placed on the map, so you don't have to do a separate search to find a place to eat or spend the night. Major points of interest are also on the map

I use my Microsoft Streets and Trips software to plan my route, intermediate stops, and destination for any travel via automobile or truck.  I am especially pleased with the ability to see and print a detailed guide for locating street addresses for those destinations with which I may be unfamiliar.  This is especially helpful for delivery of items to a customer whose business may be on a relatively remote street in areas that are difficult to find.
I have tried a few other software systems that claim to do what Streets and Trips does, and I found none of those sustems could equal or even compete with Microsoft Streets and Trips 2007

This was the only place I could find Turbo Tax where I did not have to pay extra for state tax.  I live in Washington and we do not have state income tax.  I even asked Intuit how to get a version without the state tax, they said that was not possible.  I have used Turbo Tax for many years and I will buy from Amazon again next year.

Too bad some people can not read and then blame someone else for problems they caused.  Sound like a couple of 5 year olds.

The only down side for me I received an email from amazon saying shipment would be delayed 15 days.  2 days later the software arrivied, right on the day amazon originally said it should.  Don't know why they sent the 15 day delay email

I find Turbo Tax to be the original and best income tax preparation program.  I really saddened to hear people knock it on here because they felt cheated that this version doesn't come with State tax features.  Well, if you are going to shop online, you'd better learn to read the specifications for products!  I came to Amazon precisely because I knew I'd be able to find what I needed, for less.  Texas has no State income tax, so I make sure that I buy Turbo Tax for Federal only.  

Thanks for letting me get that little rant off my chest

I've used TurboTax (or MacInTax in the early days) for over 15 years to do my taxes. Most of those years included some form of business income, requiring a Schedule C to be filed. TurboTax Home and Business is a terrific product, taking you from gathering documents, to educating you about the tax code and recent changes, to data entry, to electronic filing. It's the whole package.

One year, we used an accountant to prepare our taxes, because of a particularly unusual income situation with complicated tax implications. In the amount of time that it took me to write down by hand all the information requested on the accountant's form, I could have typed everything into TurboTax and had my taxes filed. Plus, TurboTax is less than the $250 average tax preparation bill. And that year I really missed the tax education I usually get by going step-by-step through TurboTax, giving me tax saving strategies for the following year.

Faster. Cheaper. Plus tax strategy education. That's why I'm using TurboTax again this year.

P.S. There's no income tax for my state, so getting the Federal Only version is saving me $10. Thank you, Intuit, for splitting that apart and giving me the option

I bought Adobe Acrobat 8.0 Professional for home use after having used an older version at work.  The software was very easy to install, activate, and register; and I liked the orientation program that explained how to use the features.  Since I am active with three community service organizations, I welcome the addition to my home computer for the convenience it adds to assembling mixed media "binders." This program makes it easier to email formal reports, create handbills and pamphlets, and post them to my web page.

We found the program to be easy to install and the lessons easy to retrieve. The lessons are presented in a variety of ways to accomodate one's learning style.  The accompanying text is not difficult to understand and is very helpful in explaining the basics of the program. We appreciate the repetition and the spiraling effect used as one progresses through the lessons. So far, we are pleased with the materials and have felt quite successful in learning some basis phrases.

I am fluent in Spanish. So, the Rosetta Stone Italian language software, was perfect for me. It is very easy to understand, to follow and to learn. If you study one hour per day, in one week you are going to remember several words and phrases. I don't have any regret at all, I think my investment was worthwhile.

I had the same problem with Works Suite 2002 that I had with 2006.  The product key that came with the discs would not install Microsoft Word;  the message "invalid product key" came up.  After a computer problem, I reformatted the drive and did a reinstall from the original Works 2002 discs. The invalid key message showed up when I tried to install Word 2002.  After arguing with Microsoft people for three weeks I bought the new Works Suite 2006.  After running all the discs to a clean hard drive, everything worked except,again,the invalid key message came up and wouldn't activate Word. Highly irritating.  I got it going by to Microsoft Works, Programs, clicked Word Document, got an "activate product" and got Word installed and running. This seems to be a dumb glitch in the software

Understand. I have a full MS New Office Suite that I got from work.   But choose to use this product for the many items included which can't be beat. If you just want to use Word and nothing else then get it alone. This is fine. But the other products are worth the discount and rebate also. Cost is the lowest I found. If you have a reward ceriticate using Amazon Credit card. That $25 more off the price. So in the end it cost me $30 for it. Shop smart and use any break you could get. Right?

When I got a new computer at the end of 2001, the 2002 edition was installed on my computer by Gateway. Although I never used Streets and Trips (and barely used Encarta), I used Word and Picture It! quite heavily.

Well, my hard drive died a few weeks ago, and I had to get a new computer. I bought Microsoft Works Suite 2006 to go with it. 

I was a bit apprehensive because Picture It! was replaced with Microsoft Digital Image Standard 2006 Editor. It took me a while to get fluent in Picture It!, and the idea of learning a new photo system was daunting. (I write mostly for the web, and use pictures to accompany my reviews and articles--as well as for eBooks.)

I haven't done any extensive work with it yet, but it appears easy to use IF you have experience with Picture It! If you've never used any image program before, it may be a bit confusing. (I feel that Picture It! was more self-explanatory.)

However, for all that the Works Suite gives you, I feel it's a good buy. Word 2002 has advantages over the older version (for example, you can easily insert images), and Encarta may be helpful for kids doing homework (or curious adults wanting to learn more about something).

Updating Encarta is easy as clicking a mouse: just open up the program and click "Update Encarta". New articles and updates will automatically be added to your computer. 

Although I *still* don't use Streets and Trips (I go to MapQuest reflexively), I still think this is a great Suite for a great price

I use MS Office at work, and at home, but for my daughter's computer this was perfect. 
Most people don't need the full version of office, and this package has so much for so little money.
The full version of Word is reason enough to spend this amount of money. Note: This is not the latest version, but who cares.
I would say this is one of the best software deals out there. Unless you need 100% office compatiblity, this is the package for you. If you do, buy the student and teacher version of MS Office. Read the fine print, it is for anyone not using it for business

It seems no longer possible to buy MS Word as a stand-alone program so to get it one buys Microsoft Works Suite.  This way one gets Word one version back from the most current version - plus Encarta, Streets and Trips, etc.  When purchasing be sure to distinguish between the CD version and the DVD version.  The latter comes on a single disk; the former on about six.  Also, note this is not the same as Microsoft Works - a suite of programs often preloaded on a new computer.  It has its own "peculiar" word processor, spreadsheet, etc.  For more than Word, look for the Student and Teacher Edition of MS Office Suite

This software is wonderful! I have been trying to find a good program to scrapbook digitally for many years. I've tried Broderbund (sp?) whose interface was too clumsy, Nova which was rather difficult at times (many things you can't do) and now this. When I first took this out of the package and installed it I thought I had made the wrong decision with this software since there were very, very few backgrounds, templates or embellishements even when I opened the Xtras CDs that came with this. I truly did not feel the Xtras CDs were worth purchasing since there are very few things on them. But then I found the tutorials that are included on the CD and watched the one about making collages. I didn't get halfway through the video - I had figured out how to do it. I have now created some of the best scrapbook pages I've ever made. Within hours I had a beautiful collage/letter to send with my holiday cards. My husband's first impression was a heartfelt "It's lovely". What has so throughly convinced me of the abilities of this software is that I can take ANY image and make it a background, I can create and manipulate text almost any way I want, I've been able to create my own embellishments as well as using downloaded embellishments from websites that sell it (.png format). I feel like I have no limitations on what I can do now. I imagine this software is not as sophistacated as Adobe Illustrator, but then it probably isn't as complicated to use (from what I remember that program has a rather steep learning curve).

You can also use the eyedropper tool to "pick up" any color from any picture, background, or element (read "anything") in the program. I was able to take the background colors and make embellishments that matched! I can take a color from one of my pictues and make a background that matches. You can also remove backgrounds from photos - it takes a bit of time to do, but the area around the image will be transparent - this functionality has many uses.  You can also save your files in many different formats including .jpg for file sharing, etc. There are so many more features I couldn't possibly list them here, nor would you want me too (too much time). 

If you only use premade templates and don't feel ready to venture out on your own yet this software may not be for you unless you find a website that sells templates for this software. You could start with something like Nova Scrapbook Factory Deluxe 3.0, which I liked, and when you start becoming really frustrated by its limiations it may be time to move up to this program. You may also want to read a book about digital scrapbooking to give you ideas and alert you to possibilities. 

The great thing about this program is that it isn't just for scrapbooking. You can do all your photo manipulation in it . I have always liked Paint Shop Pro so much that I haven't been able to afford to upgrade my copy since version 6, but I kept using that version. I'm so glad I got version 10 as it is very user friendly too. But please know that version 10 (which comes with this package) is not the most recent version. Version 11 is out now. If you don't want/need the Xtras CDs that come with this package you may want to just buy the most recent version and buy some embellishements from a website that makes .png files (portable network graphics format) or make your own. 

I hope you have as much fun with this software as I am having. I highly recommend the training videos on the CD - they really help

I am finding that it is not so diffucult to navigate my way around the new programs of Excel, Word etc. Opening up files - it tends to be a bit sluggish.  On the plus side I found Word 2007 seems to do a much better job of lining up indents.  In Word 2003 our indents were sometimes off by a half space which bothered us.

Office 2007 was a very nice improvement over previous versions.  The program was stable, for me at least, and the new interface was very nice.  It may take a few minutes to find where some commands have been moved to but the result was a much cleaner interface.  One thing that keeps in mind is that it uses a different file format from previous versions by default.  There is the option of changing the format to the previous version but the default option isn't compatible with earlier programs

Wow! I must say that the new office 2007 is way better than the 2003. It did take some time to get the hang of it because Microsoft changed around the icons and buttons. However, I do like it because now in Word, Excel, and Powerpoint 2007 you can creat charts and you can also preview how backgrounds look before appling to the slide. In the end, I think the 2007 is much more user-friendly than 2003. I recomend to anyone to buy this product if they wish to upgrade to the NEW 2007 Microsoft Office

If you're looking for a professional office suite, MS Office 2007 has no real competitors. I've worked extensively with Corel Office and some with Open Office. They're fine for the basics, and they cost less. But if you're looking for effectiveness, integration, speedy productivity, and an incredible array of tools, you'll want to buy MS Office 2007. And as an added bonus, the interface makes it a pleasure to work in

A quick look at the first several tutorials had me up and running.  I've been able to do most of the things I've wanted to do with this program and it's delivered on most of its promises.  My wife loves it too.

I have to remind myself that I'm not an architect and this isn't a professional program, though.  It does most things really well but it has some short comings.

I'm trying to draw my house right not which is a 4 level and haven't had any luck yet.  Although I've net seen all tutorials, I'm doubtful the program can do it at all.  Foundations have been difficult to manipulate at best.

My planned home addition includes a home theater and I've had to use work-arounds to get risers and sound insulated walls.  (Which messes up my already difficult to use cost estimator.)  But it has let me put in chairs, speakers, and a projector screen which makes the 3D views very close to what the finished product may look like.

The framing view is a dud as it appears to serve no practicle purpose.

So as long as you have realistic expectations from the program it should make you very happy.  Basic functions are easy to learn and my wife and I've had a blast planning our addition.  I can't imagine designing our addition/remodel without it.

I would buy it again

I have used other product of this kind and have never used any easier one.  The video tutorials are the greatest help of all.  The home plans they already have in the program are lacking but you can change them to what you want, but that is not the easiest task.  I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to make their dreams come true

I bought BHG Deluxe 7.0 software to plan an addition. I talked to the companies and shopped around before purchasing. I did not talk to IMSI about floor plan 3D, I gave up after trying to get through to a human. I would bet a guess the software is as good as IMSI's telephone skills. I talked to Punch Software and was warned away from their product by their own tech as I have integrated video on my computer. Apparently you need a video card with a minimum of video memory to render drawings with any usable speed using punch software. Punch Software's loss, not mine as that's a ridiculous issue for a consumer software product. Chief Architect offered a money back guarantee for their Better Homes and Gardens products, even if purchased via vendors like amazon. I'll keep this better homes and gardens home designer deluxe software, even though it does have it's annoying quirks. Even for a lesser package from the pro version, the library of items it very limited. I would guess there are quite a few more in the pro version, but it is odd to not include more of the most standard items that many home owners would need when laying out a home. You learn to just use a nearly matched symbol to fill the space, even though it is not the correct symbol or size of item. Since I am not interested in the 3D view, this is not a big issue for me. The item I needed most was floorplanning. 3D modeling is an extra item that I may play with, but is not essential for me personally. If you are truly interested in the 3D aspect, this is an issue. I would recommend visiting the product forum to see what is the best choice. [...]  For quick and easy floor plan software with a few extras, this software does better than OK. No experience necessary, and the short tutorial videos will get you started quickly. I have issues with not being able to have more control of wall types, and there are some odd roof design limitations even for a mid to low priced consumer package. These are annoying enough to urge an upgrade to pro if you want more  control of all aspects. Since I will be laying out the floor plan, then turning it over to an architect with real softare, it's not a problem for me. I have had a few restarts due to drawings getting all wild and messed up, but by ignoring the autosaved drawings, I was able to go back to my last manually saved drawing and start from a known good point. This software does have upgrade options to download from the company site. Just like any good software company, they do provide spftware patches to download. I would definately recommend this software as a quick way to do floor plans. Adding walls, doors, windows, and other items is very simple. Just don't plan on perfection, as it's based on prefabbed walls and is limited to whole inches, not fractions. Angles are an issue as well. If you need specific angles, this is not the package, it does preset increments only. I wish it had default preferences a user could select as well. Being able to preset your roofing style preferences or other items would eliminate quite a bit of redo's. I hope the software companies read these reviews. There is alot of good information on how to improve the products.

The engine behind this program is from Chief Architect, who, from what I understand, are developers of professional CAD software. It shows in this program. 

While this program has one of the best 3D walk around and capabilities, I tend to judge this and others by the drawing tools that it possesses. And this one has some good usable tools. 

Like most consumer level landscaping programs, this one has photo import so you can design around an actual photo of your home. Unlike other programs, the BHG software allows you to import and mask your own plant images. This is a great feature that my own program has which gives much better visualization with plants you might actually use. 

All the important stuff that we need to create a sellable visual landscape is there. For now, and with the choices I know of that are available to you, I find this to be the best consumer level landscape and garden program out there. 

This design software comes with an easy to understand tutorial CD. It was easy to install and start using right away. I think most folks would do quite well with this one.

I'm 9 years old and play this game frequently. I love to play it. It's not frustrating at all and it's totally exciting with many adorable animals. I didn't like her wardrobe in the beginning but then I bought a dresser and changed her outfit. The Pigs are fun to treat!!!!! They're smart!! The rabbits are soft and adorable; having my favorite animal being rabbits. I play this game for at least a half an hour a day and can't wait for the next time playing it!!!!

Get this game and try it out!! It's the best!

I did have to adjust my graphics acceleration to get the game to run smoothly, but it's a fantastic game. 

You get a building with your waiting room, exam room, living room, and bedroom. You build animal pens outside, buy medical equipment, buy books to learn about caring for each species, and need to manage your time to make sure you examine animals, sleep, eat, and for all animals that require a hospital stay you need to feed, care for, play with, and clean up after. 

It's a fun and well designed game

I have my own ATI primium TV tuner card so I tried the trial version on this software. But I realized that once one software is using a TV Tuner Card, it is difficulty to use the same device for other applications.

So, I purchased the full version of MY-IPTV which came with a USB 2.0 external device. So, I can also use it on my laptop notebook. I like this a lot.

This company boasts the feature to watch TV away from home. But I was very happy that I can watch TV from any computer at home as long as I have MY-IPTV in one of my desktop or stationary PC.

I would recommend this to folks who wathc TV on their PC or want to watch on PC like other techy guys out there.
I guess this turns your LCD monitor into a LCD TV.

I'm very impressed with how non intrusive this software is.  I used Norton for approximately 5 years before I changed to Bit Defender.  I didn't realize how bogged down my system was until I made the change.  The system scan is very quick (approx. 8-10 minutes in comparison to 20-25 minutes from Norton).  I don't even notice when the software is updating.  I'm very pleased with the program thus far and I highly recommend it

When my virus protection was about to expire, I was in a quandary.  I wasn't at all happy with the Norton I had purchased last year.  And, I wasn't especially pleased with the McAfee I had used the year before that.  When I checked the local stores, there didn't seem to be anything else to choose from.  I checked Amazon and found more options, plus plenty of customer comments to help me decide.  My son told me that BitDefender had been given the highest rating by Consumer Reports.  That, together with other customer comments on Amazon, helped me decide to give it a try.  So far, I'm delighted with its performance.  In fact, when I first installed it, it found a virus and some suspicious cookies that Norton never caught.  It doesn't appear to be interferring with my system operations (unlike Norton and McAfee), it and doesn't constantly interrupt with pop-ups and unnecessary warnings.  The best thing is that it gives me two years of protection for the price of one year with the other guys

The last reviewer didn't see any point to this software. Partially that's true---you don't need it to create your photostamp, you can do the same thing online. However, there is one big plus to the software product: buying a single sheet of PhotoStamps direct from their website costs $24.99 + $2.99 shipping, at this writing. In contrast, Amazon is selling this "boxed" version ---which includes a free voucher for a single sheet of stamps---for seven bucks less than that. Do the math

I thought this product was easy to use and produced decent results.  It works better than some of the more expensive software; I have tried at least a half-dozen similar programs, but I keep returning to this bargain-bin favorite.  For the money, it is an excellent value.

I can't believe this application. I bought it last year and I have 200 pages completed. I can truthfully say that I will never scrapbook the traditional way from this moment on. So fast and easy! I will be all up to date with my scrap booking for X-MAS '05. I am overjoyed. I don't believe I know anyone who scrapbooks traditionally anymore! Thanks for simplifying my life

I bought this to use with family photos and threw together my first 5 page comic last night.  It was fairly easy to use, but not perfect.  Instructions are thin (read 'mostly nonexistant'); so it is best that you either have time on your hand OR a lot of experience using complex photo software.

GOOD:  Simple once you get the hang of it.  Plenty of fixed comic book panel formats to chose from and the drag-and-drop photo application makes life very easy.  As long as you are OK with the formats provided, then putting family photos into a fun comic book format is incredibly easy.  I received rave reviews from my first 'comic' and the finished product was of exceptional quality.  The sofware has a nice assortment of boxes, call-outs and even some fun clip art.  This was a great buy for the price.

NOT AS GOOD: The learning curve can be steep due to the quirky layout of controls.  I guess this is not too bad of an issue since there are few controls provided with the software.  The "dude" who wrote instructions was flippant at best (really annoying if you want to find a basic answer) and definitely not paid to produce a quality product.  Downloading photos was tough until I found out the trick - after that, it is quite easy.  

BAD: No photo editing software included.  Simple things like rotating photos 90 degrees had to be done prior to loading into Comic Book Creator.  The instructions and "Comic Book Wizard" are close to useless.  Did I mention the controls?  They are basic (good and bad) and poorly laid out (bad).  There is no ability to truly customize panel layouts; so this software will not help out if you want something really creative.  (Diagonals, overlays and more.)

All-in-all, this was an excellent buy for a software package under $20.  I created a great storyboard format of some fun memories - bringing a great laugh (and a few "wows") to my family, grandparents and friends.  Just be aware that there is a learning curve to get over before you hit the fun stuff.  If the software was more expensive, then I would have given it 3 stars

Actually, Comic Book Creator lets you use your content in a million different ways, including reselling of your work.  The only limitation is that you can't sell comics created around branded content--like images from Marvel, Paramount, TOKYOPOP, etc.--because they don't allow that.  It's all in the user agreement.

I own this program and for 20 bucks, it's outstanding.  Depending on what you want to do, you need to know that there are limits though.  If you want to just drop screenshots from your PC Game and make your own story, it's awesome.  If you want to drop your own photos or mess with the provided clipart, you can do that with ease as well.  If you want to make your own comic with your own pictures, that can get a bit tricky.  You need an art program like Photoshop, or scan your own drawings into the computer and put them in the clipart folder.  Then you can use them as inserts into the panels or as clipart, which allows you to overlap the panels a bit for a semi professional layout.  I have been working on a 24 page comic for a couple months (I have a wife and kid so there are limits to my time) and it's coming out quite nicely.  Now granted, this is not going to get you any contracts or deals with publishers but it's fun.  And anyone who loves comics and has wanted to make one of their own come to life, this is the key.

Most of the world still runs on PCs and as a Mac owner (and lover), it can be tough to find software for basic stuff like accounting.  I'm a guy who makes a living making stuff sound good for radio, TV, video games and so on.  As a freelancer, I need something to keep track of my business banking, credit cards, expenses and invoices and this program does just that and very intuitively, just like my Mac. 
I used MYOB--a Mac accounting program--but found it to be tricky and didn't end up with the comprehensive reports for my accountant that I expected and wound up going over everything expense by expense and invoice by invoice for hours.  It could be that I didn't understand the program well enough, but support is extra everytime you call customer service for help, so no thanks MYOB.  In fact, I put off doing most of my 2006 accounting until January 2007 because I dreaded trying to figure out MYOB again.  
Then I broke down and bought Quickbooks for Mac.  It did everything I needed it to--a year's worth of accounting in a weekend and I never even cracked the manual.  It allowed me to save the year as a PC file to hand to my accountant on a CD.  A few days later he handed me back a CD with a Mac file of my adjusted accounting and my corp taxes were done and sent.  
I can't speak for anyone with really advanced accounting needs because I never got that deep into the program, but for my needs it's right on the money.

I'm currently learning how to use this product; however, one of the first things I noticed was that the only way to do my payroll with it was to use a SERVICE.  Now of course, this SERVICE wasn't free and with only 4 employees, the last thing I wanted to do was expend $20 a month on a SERVICE.  Wasn't that the point of getting Quickbooks - so I could do it myself?

Now I can understand that tax codes, percentages, etc can vary from state to state, but would it have been so difficult for them to just set up a section with the generalized accounts and have the user input the amounts for each account needed on their payroll checks.  See, I'm not even asking them to have the computer calculate the amounts.  Simple would have been fine with me.

As for the rest of the program, it looks as though it will be fairly easy to use after I figure out the best way to set it up for my particular business.

I'm disappointed that a Business program designed for the small businessman would omit something as vital as payroll

I teach presentation skills, so I'm always on the lookout for things that make PowerPoint better.  I've tried and recommended other software in the past, but none of them have the power of Ovation.

This is an outstanding piece of software.  The visual effects are stunning, and it's so easy to use that a child could learn it in a few minutes.  PowerPoint is boring, and everyone's presentations look the same.  Not any more!  Full-motion backgrounds and effects really jazz up your presentations, and they have over 100 professional-looking business themes available.  See their website (seriousmagic dot com) for a demonstration of what it can do.  All you have to do is drag and drop your PowerPoint presentation on the Ovation icon, choose a theme and the effects, and voila! - a new presentation!

The current version 1.0 can not process embedded video or audio files, but they say that will be fixed with the first patch within the next month or two.  Despite that shortcoming, this is the best PowerPoint enhancement available - heads and shoulders above the competitors

MS put Office 2007 on a DVD rather than a CD so there is only one disk, so they make the installation easier right off the bat. Unlike all previous versions of Office, you do not have to get into the details of what options you want. In previous versions, if you didn't make sure you installed all the features, when you went to do a function that wasn't installed, you had to dig out your Office disks and install the feature. A huge pain, but not anymore.

The installation is hands down the easiest of all versions of Office. You don't have to tell it manually where to find your files. You don't have to manually put in your favorite buttons. It's all done for you. Yes it takes some getting use to the new layout of the functions, but once you figure them out, it is so nice and smooth. This version is light years better than all previous versions.

The most impressive part of the installation is Outlook 2007. In all previous versions, you had to EXPORT and IMPORT all your files and Contacts. Anyone who experienced this, knows that it never went that smooth. Sometimes it was awful and you lost emails and Contacts in the transfer, and the time it took to do this, was very painful. This is not the case with Outlook 2007. Just load the program and it does all the transfers  from your previous version of Outlook. You don't have to do a thing, and you're up and running without missing a beat when the program is done loading. You will be shocked how simple it is.

Anything new has it's growing pains to learn, but once you do, you will be very glad you made the change

I've been using this since the first beta release, and it has sped up my productivity at work by miles.  The ribbon interface is more upfront with the commands most ofter used, and my old keystroke commands are still there as well.  After changing my default save setting to 97-2003 I have run into no compatibility problems.  

As with most of the bad reviews on MS products, it seems people are quick to rush with a bad review when they are unable to find or do something as quickly as they have in the past.  My advice is to spend ten minutes looking through all of the menus...  They make sense, and once you get used to it, you'll never want to go back to the old way again.  Everything is cleaner, smoother, faster, and easier to use than ever before, and I have been using Office for longer than I care to admit.  Let go of the past people!  This is the future of business productivity

The new office 2007 is completely revamped from older versions and is well worth the four year wait.

+'s
1.New Interface with improved accessibility to all features, you can reach all the features that were hidden away inside those menus and no need to memorize the menu contents/options.
2. If you are a developer you can write your own custom panes using Visual Studio.
3. Great Plug-ins (like the save as PDF/XPS thing available as a free dwnld), massive clip-art/template library.

-s
1.Overpriced by about 40%. Somwhere around 250-300 wud have been the right price for the Pro Edition.
2. Some backward compatability issues with the document formats and templates and doesn't work with Adobe Acrobat as of now

I am enjoying the Talk Now! Learn Bulgarian CD. Great images, repetitive visual and auditory instruction make learning the basic words, numbers, time, etc. easy. Also, the games add interest. You can print out each section with photos and words in Bulgarian. However, I would have liked to see the program come with the Cyrillic alphabet and pronunciation guide.

I purchased this product needing to work on a personal legal (nonbusiness) matter, so the noncommercial license was fine for my "home" use.  Good thing I checked with Corel after buying it and seeing the "Home Edition" captions not only on the total suite packaging but underneath the "WordPerfect" and "Quattro Pro" components (inside front box folding cover with velcro).  Corel ultimately confirmed to me that "certain components that are designed for the business customer, such as Legal Tools, MetaData Removal, Document Compare, Quickfinder to name a few are not included in the Home Edition version."  Corel needs to make this clearer in their marketing of the "Home Edition."  I focused on the word processing application, but the Quattro Pro application is also captioned as "Home Edition" so it may be missing some features available in the Quattro Pro included in other Suite versions (Standard, Pro, Student/Teacher, etc.).  The Home Edition may still be suitable for some users, but I'm a strong believer in "full disclosure."  WordPerfect itself is a great program.  Try setting point sizes with decimals in Word -- you can't.  Try changing the size of the font in legal pleadings in Word -- there's no direct control of it (the Microsoft site instructs you to change margins and number of lines per page to attempt to get Word to adjust the font size) [but remember, you need any WordPerfect version other than Home Edition to get Legal Tools]

There are a lot of good things about this software. The major pull-back is the learning curve, othervise it's a 5-star one. By the way, be sure to set the correct elevation of your house to start with, or you won't be able to change it once you put on walls, windows everything

This was my second purchase of a product like this and I loved it. The first one I tried was difficult to use. It was so easy to use. My husband and I were unsure of our remodeling plans and with this we were able to get a vision together of how our home would look once completed. It helped us pick everything from furniture location to color of carpet and flooring. My favorite feature was the Home Estimator feature that tracked our materials useage

I have purchased both the Home & Gardens interior and the Punch interior software. Home & Gardens is much easier to use. You can really start without reading much of the manual. Punch demands that you read the manual (342 pages). It is not intuative. But Punch can do so much more and has so much more creativity. IE: Punch has a library of trees, shrubs and flowers for your yard. Home & Gardens only have potted plants, nothing you can use to landscape. Punch also allows you to make custom doors or windows to your exact specifications. H&G doesn't. You have to choose a set style of door or window and change options.I also could place digital photos of my backyard behind my "house" on Punch to make it more realisitic. I like both software programs, but Punch has more options, but you have to do your homework first

Looked at them all and then bought this software... it can do a lot of things so, yes, it might take a bit to learn and get fast with. 

There is a reason it has been voted best for several years now. It does a good job if you remember the very old computer saying,
"Garbage IN...Garbage OUT" 8-)  

My wife loves the video tutorials that she can pop-up anytime she needs to without stopping the software and what she's working on.

Anything this complete, is worth the learning curve

I recently  purchased this software to redesign my bathroom and bedroom.  Compared to other products that I have evaluated, Punch! Interior Design Suite wins hands-down in the areas of versatility, stability, and 3D.  It includes many precision, dimension, and viewing options that allow you to make both simple and complex designs.  Using the split 2D/3D mode also helps with placing components such as windows and doors.  After I completed the drawings I showed them to my builder and he was able to remodel the rooms exactly as I had envisioned them.  Like most software I have used, this package does contains a learning curve.  I by no means consider myself a computer guru and I had to put in a little practice time.  You will find, however, a plethora of resources available both on-line and within the manual/tutorials to assist you with your project

It installed without any problems.  It runs without any problems. I am very happy with it. 

I am a convert from Microsoft Money.  I am self employed and have one employee.  My wife is also self-employed.  We have twenty different financial accounts (investment accounts, retirement accounts, checking accounts, savings accounts, a mortgage, a home equity line of credit and credit cards).  We often pay business expenses with our personal credit card, as the credit card gives us frequent flyer miles for every purchase.  Quicken 2007 Home and Business allows us to do our personal accounting and business accounting all in one program, which makes it much easier.  

The one step update (automatic downloading of our transactions and balances from financial institutions) works with 17 of our 20 accounts.  Downloading data from the other 3 accounts requires some manual steps, but is still fairly painless.

I like the online backup feature. It is inexpensive (you pay a small annual charge) and easy to use.

I am not very impressed with the investment analysis features, although I have not yet fully explored them.  I would like to be able to compute realized and unrealized annualized rates of return for individual positions or groups of positions, and it doesn't seem like I can do that in this program.

I believe it is important to say that I am a QuickBooks ProAdvisor. As a technical consultant to small businesses, I began supporting QuickBooks several years ago after I saw how it benefited my clients.

I began useing QuickBooks myself in 1999 for my business. This version is one of the best advances I have seen. The new home page shows the various work-flows in an easy to understand format, making it easy to get to the form I need with one click. I really like the new "Centers" for customers, vendors and employees. Most of the information I need when looking for history with a customer or vendor is available when I click on the customer or vendor name. With one more click I can easily see the original transaction. I used to have to go through several screens to get to the information I needed.

The industry customization in the Premier Edition is a great addition and well worth the additional investment. I have a client using the Contractor Edition. The Contractor Center provides a quick glance at how the business is doing. The Job Cost reporting is an excellent tool to help better manage the business by comparing actual to estimated costs. They have been able to improve their estimates based on the information QuickBooks makes available to them.

The key to having the information you need is to make sure you get it setup properly in the beginning. Spend some time reviewing the excellent on-line training and help before you setup your company files. If you don't like reading the instructions, another option would be to get the help of a local QuickBooks ProAdvisor for assistance.

I highly recommend it.

I have been supporting QuickBooks as a financial and technical consultant for small businesses for over a dozen years.  This year's version added a neat feature that allows you to see all of your customer's invoices, payments, estimates, - all in the same window - just by clicking on a customer in the list.  No more multiple clicks to create customer reports.  It is just plain easy, and the information pops up on your screen immediately. Congratulations to Intuit on a job well done

Building on the Intuitive QuickBooks Pro interface and SQL database, QuickBooks Premier enables firms to scale - merely by clicking on a button and paying the difference. This ensures no work is lost. There is a whole new menu dedicated to specific Industries. While the estimate can have multiple options, when the customer places an order, the Sales Order function enables QuickBooks to saddle up for the ride. It generates Purchase Orders with the click of a button, and when goods are received, keeps track of who it is for. Invoices are generated from the sales order as well, and partial invoicing keeps track so I don't leave money on the table. I use the email function all the time, sending pdf attachments and cc:g myself so there's a time stamp. 

To address the problem of sharing large files, there is a new Portable Company File (much like a Zip file) which compresses files for emailing. 
I have also grown to appreciate the online banking auto-reconciliation function - I log in to the bank every morning, and watch as transactions appear and then get matched with my books, leaving me only unreconciled transactions. 

QuickBooks also enables integration with third party software - there is a legion of industry specific solutions that help with core business operations. With 2006, QuickBooks has moved from being a software to a Business Operations System

I am a solo family medicine physician and have been using the Quickbooks Pro series since 2003.  At first, I was a little upset with being forced to upgrade my QB Pro 2003, however once I installed the new Premium 2006, I must say I am very pleased.

From the beginning, everything has changed just a small bit, however in a very good way.  In my past version of QB Pro 2003, I had to toggle between different screens in order to move from deposits to writing checks, etc.  In Premium 2006 this is no longer the case.  A very easy to use and intuitive home page shows everything you need to use.  Each different tool is one simple click away.  I very much like the new enhanced payroll option in that I can now print out my state tax forms along with my federal forms.  In the past, it would take an hour or two out of my family time in order to fill in those little boxes and double check each figure with my CPA.  Now I print out each form and am finished in less than 10 minutes.

I would highly recommend this product to any solo or small group practice.  The versatility and power found in Quickbooks Premium allows me to keep track of my finances personally.  The added convenience of the payroll services just makes this product an even better buy.  Yes, there are enough subtle differences between the Pro and Premium version to justify spending a few extra dollars.  I would definitely buy this software title again

For years I used PowerQuest's Drive Image 7 for backups. It's rock solid and totally dependable. When Symantec aquired PowerQuest they rolled the underlying technology of Drive Image 7 into Norton Ghost. The result is a very capable and reliable package that can backup partitions or entire drives and also provides support for incremental backups. Most importantly, like Drive Image 7, it provides for emergency recovery of your system. Just boot from the Ghost CD and restore the backup (restore point) that you select. I've tested this process by making both full system backups and subsequent incremental backups, and then restoring the system from those backups. The process works flawlessly. If you need to restore to a different physical drive (replaced a failed drive, etc), the process requires a few extra selections, but is still very straightforward. Just take the time to read the manual.

I've seen Acronis True Image recommended by some both here and elsewhere. I've tried Acronis and find it lacking in one major respect: It simply is not reliable. During trials, I made backups with Acronis. Acronis indicated that the backups were successful but, when attempting to make a system recovery just minutes later, Acronis indicated that the backups were corrupted and could not be used. The backups were worthless.

When purchasing backup software remember that bells and whistles don't count for anything. The only thing that counts is reliability. It must be able to reliably restore your system. Norton Ghost passes that test with flying colors.

Challenging and fun. Graphics a fair compared to the mindless flashy video games. Educational value is exellent, challenging and helps develop speed as well as accuracy. The challenge of having to think and get the right math answer in order to advance makes the games more challenging than the flashey graphic video games. If the animation was similar to the flashy video game adventures ( IE: Jak 3 or Ratchett and clank)it might make it too hard because of all the distractions and tools obtained. It might be interesting if that level of graphics and animation was worked into the game. The younger kids may be better able to intergrate a multi-tooled, multi-level, multi-directional with more mapping and varied spatial orientation than older people. My eight year old was able to gain more speed quicker on the game than I was

I have every single (that I know of) Math Blaster game out there. My kids love them all. I saw this one and couldn't resist buying it. My 12, 10, and 7 year-olds all play this version. (It's too simple for the 12 year old, but he plays as a reward for piano practice - so I'm not too concerned about his refreshing earlier math skills.) My thought it to have each child play the grade level above theirs, and that's ususally right where they're at. Yes, there are a few annoying glitches in the way some of the characters can and cannot move around (I don't play them myself to know well) but I would hope that children are not so whiny that it matters too much. I think every family should have Math Blaster Geometry, Algebra, and all grade levels. If you can make math fun, and use it as a POSITIVE REWARD...that is called a "win win"! :

I have tried other systems before and they took the "long way around" about getting to the Rock and Roll stuff I wanted. This one however jumps straight into what I wanted to know about ROCK guitar. The teaching method is fantastic. The program shows not only where notes would fall but includes a "virtual fret board" so I can see exactly what to play. This feature includes a "slow" version to start with then a normal speed version that (in almost every case) is exactly like the song being heard. I have played guitar (that is fooled with guitar) for about twenty years this program got me playing and learning every day for a couple hours. Now I have much more fun jamming and playing songs I have heard. I recommend this for anyone beginners to intermediate

I have been taking acustic guitar lessons for 6 years now. I decided to buy this to try and learn to play the electric guitar I recieved as a gift. It's a pretty good method. Sometimes a bit difficult to work with, but you do learn some things. I stopped using it because it became increasingly difficult to play when I realized that I had a bass amp. So make sure you have all the right equipment, and I would have to say that this might be easier for someone who's taken guitar lessons.

I picked this up for my twelve year old son.  He is a beginner and has been glued to his electric guitar and eMedia Rock Guitar Method for the last two weeks.  The program is a great starter, just in case the kids don't stick with it.   It's better than $45 bucks an hour once a week, for now, at least.    

Great Product!  I reccomend it

I thought this was a great product.  It's like having your own guitar instructor, but even better.  You only have to pay once and you get hours of instructions you can use for as long as you want.  Also, you can use it any time you want without having to make a trip.  I'm pleased with my purchase.  You will be too

Though I've odered many times with Amazon, this is the first time I have been excited enough to review a product!  I'm an adult who wants to learn guitar for fun and didn't want to play "Mary had a little lamb" and scales for months.  I have only used the software for about an hour, and have already been playing parts of songs I actually like!  I have been playing guitar for a total of one week prior to receiving this (without any instruction).This is perfect if you don't have the patience or desire to learn the traditional way.  I wish I had this when I was 14, I would have loved it.

I can't vouch for the whole thing yet, since I've only played with it for an hour, so I give it 4 stars instead of five.  From what I've seen I have no reason to expect that it will let me down and highly recommend it

This is a good computer Bible, but for the money, I prefer a program like AMG Bible Essentials which has the Libronix Library System built-in and can be integrated with other Bible study software.  For about $15 more the AMG program has both KJV, Apocrypha and NASB, including a lot of other capability, like Greek translations, word study, exegesis, parallel Bible comparisons, etc.  The Rainbow Bible is an older issue and shows its age by not offering features as mentioned above.  Some benefits of this Bible include both NIV and KJV translations, color maps, Matthew Henry's commentary, Naves and a version of Foxe's Book of Martyrs. The various colors can be distracting at times, but overall it is worth considering, particularly if you like the NIV

I wanted this Bible for Mother's Day after I did not get it I ordered it on June 25 and got it rather quickly.  Enough said about the wonderful shipping time with Amazon Prime.

I normally do not like Bibles that do not have the words of Christ in red but this Bible is sensational.  I love it!!!! I like the way it gives an overview of each book of the Bible.  The colorful maps and illustrations make this Bible beautiful.  At the end of the Bible there are 365 memory verses to be learned each day.  So not only is studying emphasized but learning scriptures is also emphasized.

This Bible is wonderful for individuals who are new to reading the Bible.  I would highly recommend geting this Bible as a gift for a new convert or seasoned veteran in the Gospel who is interested in in depth study.  Reading this Bible is fun.

ISBN-1581700296 Black Leather Non-Indexed KJV

This is a beautiful bible. Every verse is colored and each color stands for something such as Love, Family, Faith, Salvation, etc. It also has the center column reference, a one year bible reading schedule, a daily verse lisiting with, of course, 365 verses, one for each day of the year, various maps and pictures, outlines of each book, and a list of 100 popular bible verses, 50 from the old testament and 50 from the new. There is also a section in the front of the book that explains the color system and gives examples as well. It is also available in NIV as well as KJV. 

I'd highly suggest this bible to anyone, but shop around. The one I bought listed at amazon for $77.99 but I bought it at a local bookstore for $39.99 plus tax. Same book, same ISBN exactly.

Photoshop CS 2 Screen The Current Adobe Photoshop CS 2 Line

    * The Adobe Bridge: The next generation of the Photoshop File Browser. This allows you to organize, browser and locate photos, images and movies across shared Adobe Creative Suite applications.

      Since The Bridge is a standalone application, you can launch it separately or access it by double clicking on Adobe Photoshop CS 2 in the dock.

    * New Camera Raw gives you control over your digital negatives in Adobe Photoshop CS 2. It is much easier to work on a several images at the same time. The Camera Raw has Auto checkbooks for Exposure, Shadows, Brightness and Contrast sliders.

    * The Vanishing Point lets you clone, paint and transform images. Image Warping allows you to fold, stretch, pull, twist and wrap an image into shape by selecting an on-demand preset or dragging custom control points.

    * Photoshop CS2's Smart Objects allow you to scale and transform images and vector illustrations without losing image quality, and

    * Smart Guides appear when you're moving text or objects around, making it easier to align them.

Working within the 'Inner Core' of Adobe Photoshop CS 2

Most of my Photoshop CS work is done in the Browser. I single-click the photos that I need for my Photoshop CS project. Now I have a group of highlighted photos that can be used in the Browser's Automated menu.

The inner core of the Photoshop CS Browser's Automated menu contains: Batch, PDF Presentation, Contact Sheet II and Online Services. Also, Automated menu contains Photomerge, Picture Package and Web Photo Gallery.

Running these automated menu tasks from the File Browser saves me a lot of time. I can avoid opening each photo file separately in Photoshop CS.

The Photoshop CS 2 Browser has Sort capabilities that contains the Filename, Flag, Rank, Width and Height. Also, Sort capabilities that contains File Size, Resolution, File Type and Color Profile.

The Photoshop Browser's Sort contains Date Created, Date Modified, Copyright and Custom. You can sort them in ascending or descending order.

Photoshop CS Photomerge and PDF Presentations

In Photomerge, I can make a collage of photos and move them in any order. Also, I can take several sections photos of a large bridge using a tripod. I then take the section photos and join them together with Photoshop CS' Photomerge. I still have to edit the new Photomerge photo for length, size and contrast.

In PDF Presentation, I can turn my photos into Acrobat PDFs and stitch them together. The fun is turning my new creation into a slideshow with various transitions. The PDF Presentation is cross-platform that can be used on a Mac and Windows computers.

Working with the 'Outer Core' of Adobe Photoshop CS 2

Keyboard Commands

The one-key letter shortcuts that I use quite often is M for Marquee, V for Moving objects, T for Text, I for Eyedropper and C for Crop. There is a multitude of Toolbox one-key letter shortcuts that you can use or change.

Toolbox uses the Shift bar to get to related tools on the same pop-out menu. For example, to cycle through the Lasso, Polygonal Lasso, and Magnetic Lasso tools, hold down Shift bar and keep pressing "L" key.

Change Keyboard Commands in Photoshop CS 2

This means that missing Photoshop CS Menu keyboard commands can now be added. For example, I am constantly making changes to my images by changing the photos' contrast and brightness.

Now without using the computer mouse, I use the Command, Control, and C keys in unison. Like a piano chord, I can now change the contrast and brightness in my digital photographs.

I use Command, Control, and letter keys for adding keyboard commands. This works well within the menus and plugin filters that I use in Photoshop CS.

Pro Reaction

Photoshop CS offers flexibility and nondestructive editing. Photoshop's Welcome screen and improved Help ease the learning curve for new users. The Help menu is changeable. I find Photoshop CS' Help menu an excellent way to learn the various functions of Photoshop program. Photoshop CS comes with a paper, hardcopy paper manual. Photoshop CS 2 works best within Mac OS X 10.4 Macs including Intel Macs. 

Con Reaction

You have to read and work with hardcopy paper manual. The Bridge does not work in older Photoshop programs. 

Final Words

Photoshop remains the industry standard for professional photo editing, graphic design, and digital imaging. Adobe Photoshop is considered the industry standard. Photoshop skills are required for employment in the graphic design field.

Digital photographers will benefit from Adobe Photoshop with its strong digital-camera raw workflow.

Photoshop CS 2 is in a league of it's own. It can be used to do professional photo retouching and correcting but it is also probably the best painting package out there. It's not perfect however. There are some features that high end compositing and color grading programs like Inferno and DaVinci have that Photoshop could use, and the warper is just bare bones but then we're talking big bucks and no doubt Photoshop will eventually have something like them. Except for a few filters, it can function in 16 bits per channel which was a long time coming but now it's here, making it a professional product. Still, as far as I'm concerned, the ultimate paint program has yet to be written

I was very pleased to discover all of the data packed into this program.  Setting up the query parameters is easy & the amount of info concerning places of interest (services, banks, transportation) is substantial.  About the only drawback I found was the quality of the help contents, which was not very user friendly.  Most of the time I was unable to find solutions to my question/problem because the data was way too complicated (displaying data in technical equations) or was not listed at all.  However, calls to technical support usually resolved the questions.  Finally, I was disappointed that the program does not allow you to print written legends off to the side on your map (ie: a listing of addresses for your push pin locations).  Other than that, the program is very handy, loaded with tons of great data & the quality of the maps is superior.

Absolutely love this program. I'd been using Norton for years and so was initially hesitant to switch. Its not as user friendly as Norton and has the annoying habit of repeatedly asking for permission even after it has been granted. On the upside this feature adds to its efficiency and gives the user complete control over all internet activity, making it an exceptionally good security program.

Good product Amazon had a great price.  Even though people say it is high priced I paid $44 after discounts.  I tried the Beta version and I liked it.  Beta version does not give you all of the features but enough to get the idea.  Easy to install worked at the get go.  Intuitive enough to figure it out.  You may have to go through things a few times to understand what it means.   Didn't have a manual with the Beta version and still figured it out. Manual does provide information, works great.  Didn't need any help. Had Mcafee before didn't find any new virus. It works as good as Mcafee but it is a lot faster when you start up.  Both Kaspersky and Mcafee have features I like.

I've been using this for several years without ever having a problem. I like this new version even better than the last version by having everything in one control panel makes it easier than before. It uses less system resources than Norton plus I know people that have gotten viruses using Norton & McAfee. Kaspersky always rates in the top three. The only drawback is there is no anti spyware but I don't feel that is an issue. Let them worry about viruses & such & I'll continue using Webroot's Spysweeper to control spyware. Together, they make a great combo to keep my computer clean

I have used MS WORKS from about the time it was born, when it was quite primitive and sometimes unstable. But I have continued to use it, primarily for databases, because it has become progressively more stable and easy to use.  These are not all small and simple databases--many include several thousand items, each with 20 to 30 fields of data.  It is easy to &quot;find&quot; single items or to assemble groups of items (&quot;filter&quot;), and to print customized reports.  So if you don't need (or want) the super sophistication of ACCESS, I have found WORKS to be a friendly and helpful--and inexpensive--alternative

I put MS Works on all systems that I make for other people. It has everything they need, and it dosen't break the bank. The only thing I don't like is that there is no Presentation software, or PowerPoint clone. Then again, if they included that, MS Office sales would go down A LOT!!

I've been working with Punch AS/4000 since v10.0 was released (about 12 months ago). Although I agree in many respects with the positive reviews. For example, there are is a large feature list. However, there are issues with the software. For example: 

- Hard coded limitations in the software design (e.g. four possible scale options for printing, does not support Grid Snap smaller than 3/8" or 10mm - which seriously complicates moving things around on a drawing with any degree of precision, very tiny dimension text on Windows, etc.)
- Inaccuracies: I printed a 1:100 scale drawing that came out at 1:94 approximately;
- I couldn't fit a scale house drawing on 8.5 X 11 paper, no print preview;
- There are limitations and inconsistencies with dimensions (i.e. placement, snap to geometry, etc.)
- The PowerTools seem to be a series of independently developed add on modules that don't necessarily conform with the application interface (e.g. precision, look and feel, functionality)
- The elevation editor is very limited. It basically provides a visual representation of the drawing with some editing and texture applications
- Can't differentiate exterior wall treatments independently from the wall surface (e.g. brick and siding on the same floor).
- Object library is very limited for plumbing fixtures, furniture, windows, etc. Common items aren't in the library nor are they easy to find. (You can create them yourself though).
- The 3D object editor is ok but not terribly intuitive.
- Multi-floor buildings get complicated to work with once you add floors or ceilings.
- Once you add objects, drawings get big and slow very quickly.
- Import/Export is limited

In short AS/4000 could use an overhaul, an updated object library, a major upgrade to scale and printing and an overall clean-up to create a more integrated and functional product. Also, incorporate user feedback into future releases

This is really good software.  I own CAD software, but it doesn't do what Punch Home Design can do.  It has a bit of a learning curve, but if you take the "step by step" tutorials, you'll find it much easier to learn.  I did a module of the tutorial (there are several), then I saved that drawing as "test" and loaded my own and did the appropriate things to it.  By going back and forth, I got to use the steps being taught several times which made it easier to remember "how" to do that thing.  If you're planning to remodel (that's what I'm doing) or building from scratch, this software will give you a real good idea of what your completed remodel or construction will be like.  It will more than pay for itself by saving you from making a costly mistake

After using this software for a week, I'm generally pleased with the results. The learning curve is not too difficult to climb; though I have some prior experience with less sophisticated versions of this type of software.

The box comes with a thick printed manual, which is nice to have for reference. The index in the manual is good but not great. Unfortunately the manual is not comprehensive. It appears to cover the core functionality but does not have any depth to its discussion of "power tools". The manual appears to be a nearly verbatim copy of the online help.

The software comes with short online instructional videos -- basically animated screen captures with voice-over commentary. The two or three videos that I've watched have filled in the gaps that the manual left open.

My pc has a 2001-era 1Ghz Celeron and 1GB of memory. It renders the 3D drawings fast enough to not be frustrating, and I have limited patience for this sort of thing. However, I have not added great amounts of detail to the plan yet -- mostly just walls, roof, electrical, and some trim. The addition of detail may slow rendering down enough to be annoying. Other reviewers have complained about performance, but the documentation has hints for speeding up if you run into problems.

While the core parts of the software are pretty good, the power tools leave a little something to be desired. This may just be a lack of education on my part, but if so then I'm going to blame the skimpy documentation. These power tools almost appear to have been developed by either different groups or by third parties. Overall they lack the polish and usability that is part of the core software. Take the "room wizard", for example. This is a slick way to put together the interior floor plan of the house. The problem is that the room wizard launches almost as a separate application, and when you're done it asks to "update the current design". When you say yes, it appears to paste the picture drawn in the room wizard back into the main application. From there, it is difficult (impossible?) to get the interior layout to overlay your foundation design.

I had difficulty with other power tools: the topo designer is clunky, the site planner has an annoying lot size limitation (no line can be more than 1000'), the estimator won't let you add additional materials (you can put in the cost of concrete for your foundation, but you can't add fill or stone for drainage; if I have to manually put this stuff into a separate spreadsheet then having a built-in estimator is pointless). And so on. Again, maybe this is a learning thing, but the rest of the software is easy to figure out -- why are these so different?

Overall, I would give the software 3.5 stars: four stars for doing the stuff it absolutely must do very well, minus one star for advertising extras that don't work so good, plus a star for good documentation on the core functionality, minus half a star for failing to document the extras. (I figure that the extra thirty to fifty bucks of cost over competing brands is due to these extras, but I haven't tried the competition.

If you are even remotely familiar with home design or CAD software then this is your product assuming you can't deal with the price or steep learning curve of Chief Architect Base v10 (~$1300).  Chief Architect (CA) is the Holy Grail of powerful yet intuitive home design software but it's not cheap and it's not for beginners; it is really aimed at pro's not home enthusiasts.  Most home enthusiasts would be far better off with Punch! AS4000.  But if you have a brain, some patience, and like a challenge and want the best, go with CA.

Punch! AS4000 v10 is the *best* product on the market in the sub-$1000 price point *easily* beating out products like CadSoft Envisioneer @ $795 (4x the cost!).  In my opinion CadSoft Envisioneer has no market.  If you are going to spend $800 on "Pro" software, get Chief Architect for $500 more.  If you don't need that much power that CA has (ie you aren't an engineer or architect drawing formal construction blueprints), than buy Punch! AS4000 for $500 less than Envisioneer.  Envisioneer is a product priced in no-mans land.  It's a suckers buy.

Back to the product at hand.  First, Punch! AS4000 isn't as easy to pick up for a neophyte (ie complete computer design newbie) as say 3D Home Architect or Better Homes & Gardens (both of which were spawned from the same 3DHA v4 code base).  But, it is much more fully featured, faster and much more powerful and less buggy.  It's UI is more standard and intuitive to Windows software guru's, and it's 3D renderer blows away the competition not only in speed but quality.  It renders stunning 3D scenes which blow away the competition visually at 1/4 to 1/3 the time!

Plus, Punch! recently (and quietly) acquired 3DHA from Riverdeep / Encore to supplement thier "bottom-end sub-$40 market".  In other words, Punch! considers 3DHA to be the bottom-feeder and not real competition against thier product for which they are 100% correct.  3DHA and it's derivatives are junk compared to Punch!; every few years I review them all and Punch! has been on top for a while.  Not just in features.  Not just in speed.  Not just in reliability / stability.  But across the board.  

TopTenReviews recently gave Punch! the #1 spot, as they deserve.  Punch! has also been the top selling home enthusiast design software for the last 6 years running.  It's not by accident.  It's because it is the best; hands down.

3DHA users should seriously consider jumping ship to Punch! now that they own it.  The only reason to consider 3DHA over Punch! is if you are a total clueless newbie.  Once you are no longer a totally clueless newbie, it's time to move to a serious program like Punch!  Even if you have a lot of 3DHA content, it doesn't mean you shouldn't start moving over to Punch!  You can continue to use both until Punch! has a solid 3DHA importer.

This recent acquisition means that Punch! owns 75%+ of the home design software market for home enthusiasts.  This is estimated to be a $50 million market and Punch! pretty much has it owned.  Since Punch! considers 3DHA to be the bottom-feeder, don't count on the 3DHA title or code base to be drastically improved in the future.  In fact, if I had to gues I would bet that over time the existing 3DHA code base will be scrapped by Punch! and replaced with it's own code base w/ some of the power tools stripped.

In short:

1) if you are a professional who knows their way around CAD and want the best for home design despite the cost, get Chief Architect v10 Base ($1300) or Full ($2k+).  It's learning curve is steep but nothing beats it.

2) if you are a home enthusiast who has a clue around CAD or home design software, then this (Punch! AS 4000) is your choice.  End of story.  Buy it.

3) if you are a complete newbie and have never used home design or CAD software before, I recommend buying the cheapest v6 or v7 3DHA Special Edition you can find here on Amazon for only $9.99!!!  It's very limited but will serve it's purpose.  Go through the tutorials.  Learn how to use it.  Play with it until you know what is going on.  Design something simple.   This way it costs you only $10 to leverage all of the tuts included in 3DHA and come up to speed with the terminology and concept of home design.  Then toss it and buy Punch! AS 4000 v10 to do your real work. 

It takes a real program to do real work. ;-P

It is the coolest game about horses. It teaches the most important basic about caring for horses and riding horses. It is a bit confusing at the beginning and a little help from Mom or Dad should be welcome, even though my daughter found things that I did not, it's a team effort at the beginning. After that it's just very pleasurable, and can go on for ever. According to my daughter it is very addictive (!!) and she has already Dreamer and Lets ride. OK it's not high visual 3D as the others, but let's face it, a lot more entertaining.
In all it is a real cool game, and worth the 5 stars. Perfect gift, and good for Mom and Dad also...

I bought this and I think it is a very good game but, I can not really continue the game because I lose money trying to get some by doing the 5 things. I am going to keep on trying to finish the game. If you are really good at solving games and love horse I would get this game. And anyone can try it and if you keep on trying it you can win the game

At first I didnt like this game because of the graphics but once I learned how to play I really thought it was fun one time I was so interested that I woke up at 8:00am and played the whole game to 11:00pm
If you are a horse lover and know some amount about horses you will love this game if you do NOT like horses you might still like it but I dont know because I am a major horse lover so here are some things in the game-

-feed and groom your horse every day.

-keep practicing your riding skills you could make it to the championships

-they will giveyou tasks to do for instance "breed a horse".

- you can go to the breeders office to breed a horse or you can own a stallion and a mare and buy the breeding pasture and breed them yourselves

          If you buy this item I hope you have fun with it and hope my review was helpful to you.

Every once in a while you come across a product that does just what you wanted it to.  The Snapstream remote is one of them.

I just recently built a home theater pc through which I play music and movies. However, the HTPC is in a different room than my projector and I needed a way to operate the pc remotely while in the theater room.  I chose the Snapstream remote for this function and have been well pleased.

I also highly recommend the Snapstream remote for those people using or looking to use the Beyond TV PVR solution.  I record all my favorite TV programs on my HTPC in high-def and able to access them with a single click of a button via the Snapstream remote.

This is one product that I can recommend with no reservations

This remote works really well and it's easy to create your own profiles for whatever application you use, or to customize it however you want.  There is a good user community that is doing a lot of cool things with the Firefly.  Set up is simple and the range is good.  It "just works."  

The only suggestion is that the buttons are not backlit so it's hard to use in the dark.  Adding to that problem is that the remote is pretty much symmetrical so you can be holding it upside down and not really realize it.  If it weren't for that I'd give it five stars, and if they came out with a version that had backlit buttons I wouldn't hesitate to upgrade

I've used the ATI all-in-wonder remote with a make-shift media center solution before and it's been sluggish, and sometimes non-responsive.  Not so for the FireFly.  Quick, responsive and adaptive. 

I also tried the CyberLink media remote.  Not even suitable to prop-up a bird-food tray.  You'll find Cyberlink's tech support is positively absurd.  Their primary focus is to ask you tons of questions till you run out of patience, or till they find an excuse to tell you they can't help you.

The firefly really rocks.  Controls several programs and tools and even provides a mouse interface incase you can't get things just right with the application and pre-defined buttons.  

If you have a PC and want media-center performance on it - I'd recommend this guy.

Sadly the data is RF for this remote; not IR.  I was hoping to 'absorb' all the functions of this remote into my Harmony 688 but they don't talk the same.  I think SnapStream offers another product to talk IR for the same purposes, but I'm not there yet.  Still getting my sea-legs with the Firefly's abilities.

I've had this PC remove for 1 year and I have used it everyday that I am home and I have not yet changed the remote batteries.  My PC has suddenly become more entertaining and useful.  With this remote, the time I spend sitting in front of the monitor is reduced.

In my 860 sq ft APT, the farthest point away from my pc is about 50 ft.  The remote has always worked from anywhere in the APT thru 2 walls. I was surprised to get this much range. I have not yet found a spot from which it doesn't work.  To get the best range BE SURE to position the USB RF receiver near the computer as directed.

With my PC, I'm always playing music.  I also play digital video files that were either taken with my camera or were rented digitally from the Internet.  I have a good graphics card with S-Video TV out.  I got a 50 ft S-Video/Out cable; this connects my PC and TV which are in different rooms.  

With this remote, I now can play (and control) my entire digital music collection on my home stereo (which is connected to the TV) without being at my PC or be in the same room as my PC.  Also, with this remote, any video that can be played on my PC, (online streaming or local) I can watch and control it (pause, rewind, slow motion, next, FWD) on my TV.  

My PC/TV has effectively become a powerful media center--Media center PC not needed.   

There is so much more...  with the remote, I use the mouse from far away (lying in bed or on the couch); there a numerous ways to get creative with this.

I wish the remote was lighted. Still, the keys are arranged for "touch typing" so to speak.  Another negative, I've noticed that Windows Media Player sometimes crashes when video is launched from within the software that comes with the remote.

I purchased this Firefly remote a month ago to work with my PC-PVR (I have got a Hauppauge PVR-250 card and BeyondTV 3).  As my computer and TV set are in different rooms, I thought it would be convenient to have an RF remote control so that I can still control video recording/playback while sitting in front of my TV. RF signals can usually travel a longer distance, and most importantly, they can penetrate walls.

However, my first installation with the Firefly remote was not a totally success.  It functioned well, but I have only measured a 6-foot of workable distance - with full battery power, and no blocking objects or interference sources nearby.  I thought either I had a defective item, or the product was not as good as they said.

I contacted Snapstream for support, and they suggested to try a different USB port or use a powered USB hub for plugging receiver.  My computer has 6 USB ports - 4 in back and 2 in front, all built on the motherboard.  I was using a front USB for the measurement.  After I switched to an USB port in back, everything becomes perfect.  I have learned that even all being built on the same motherboard, USB ports can be different, which may provide different power levels for external devices.

Now my Firefly works great for my application, which is about 13 feet of transmission distance and with a wall (and some blocking objects as well) inbetween.  Firefly remote can even perform the job of a mouse.  Although it may not be as fast and convenient as a real mouse, it comes in handy for quick-and-easy controls. For the convenience the Firefly remote brings, I give it 5 stars!

have been using acrobat since v3,v4,v6.  v8 is in line. seems a bit faster, smoother etc.  have tried imitations on other machines.  from a purely subjective view, acrobat is best.  a bit pricey, but the best. with the usual caveats, can be installed on a desktop and a notebook, but requires a call to tech support which was quick and smooth

Finally some good compression for scanned text/image

I bought this package because I wanted good, high-compression universally accessible documents and images for my personal web page. (Google Werbos).
Finally, after zillions of googles on compression technology and trying many other things (see my other reviews), I found something that really, really works well, in a highly flexible and controllable way! What a relief! Much better than Acrobat 6.0, and other packages I have tried and reviewed. 
    The key capability lies in the "save as" command, which includes "optimized pdf" as one of the file types. The "settings" there gives you the power to choose JBIG2 and JPEG2000 compression, the very best formats for black and white or color scanned images or papers. And of course, as pdf, they are easy for anyone to read. 
   An example: two weeks ago, the world's top empirical nuclear physicist, in Japan, sent me a set of 24 1-meg JPEGs for a 24-page paper. Nothing I had would read it, except Microsoft Digital Image, which let me fix the pages and crop them; in Adobe 6.0, they ended up being a readable 14 meg document. No better. I printed it out at work, and scanned in the result at 400 dpi to a good modern copier/scanner. It ended up 5 megabytes. (The copier was modern and "intelligent".) Then, at home, in Adobe 6, it would
optimize it to pdf version 6, a nice 2.6 megabyte file. Today, I got it
to 940 K (and better quality, to the eye)in Acrobat 8.0, in a controllable
predictable way. I had previously tried many, many other options (including lots of Microsoft programs, all options).
    If I understand what I have seen... I could have used Acrobat 8.0 DIRECTLY, without all that printout and scan nonsense! The direct control in the "save as" command gets rid of the need to do all that. What's more,
I just reduced a 3.5 meg file (from the best previous material) to 1.02 megs. (As best I recall, I used CVISION before and only got that file to 1.5-2 megs. Acrobat 8.0 seems to be doing much better.)
    If you google a lot on compression and comparisons, you will see some small advantage of CVISION over older versions of Adobe Image Capture and Acrobat. But that's misleading. In Acrobat 6.0, I couldn't GET to that better compression. (Maybe if I had a PhD in Adobe, I could, but I tried hard..). With 8.0, it was easy. And the results are better than CVISION now, so far as I can tell. I certainly see no value at all in the new XPS formats Microsoft is touting, with Vista, now that something so much better is available.
    One caveat: published benchmarks say that the DjVu format may be better yet. I did not consider it, partly because of cost, but more because everyone knows how to get the latest pdf reader but DjVu might stop people going to my web page. But if Google Books popularizes it, I might reconsider DjVu. But then again... knowing what lies behind DjVu.. we might figure out something even better... eventually...  and maybe the future pdf standards will open to that!

Installed on Windows XP with no problem and have already done an e-file before the "mid-Feburary" update mentioned by others.  No problems with either.  Having used TurboTax for 6+ years, I had been led to believe that TaxCut was inferior to TurboTax.  I was pleased to discover that TaxCut is just as good as TurboTax and it's cheaper too!  It also includes a rebate for a free Federal e-file, something that Intuit quietly has removed from this year's TurboTax.  I plan to use TaxCut from now on

I think the rosetta stone software is a pretty effective mode of learning. However, it is necessary to do it on a regular basis and would probably be even more effective if one were to study verbs and vocabulary outside of the program. In order to get the most out of the program I feel it is essential to do all the portions of each level/lesson.

So I did the unthinkable. I put Windows Vista Business on my Mac--specifically my Mac Mini. it works great, no system slow downs and no crashes. The Mac handles Vista beautifully. I had no problems using Boot Camp 1.2 in order to install it. The Mac Drivers for Vista (included with Boot Camp) all worked fine. The Vista installation took all of about 30 minutes including some updates and such. I had Windows XP home on my mac b4 and while it worked well , Vista Business works much more smoothly.  

As you may or may not know a Mac Mini is not exactly a powerhouse computer. I have a 1.66 gigahertz Core Duo with 1gb of Ram on it. It displays the Aero interface perfectly especially hooked up to my 32 inch Widescreen LCD TV. Seems even the lowest cost Mac can still make Vista shine while most PCs cant. One disclaimer tho. All intel macs can run Vista Ultimate without a hitch except the Mac Mini (which can only go up to Business/Home Premium)

While Vista is still behind OS X 10.4 (Tiger) its a much better release from XP. Now im just waiting to upgrade my little Mac Mini in October for the release of OS X 10.5 (Leopard)

The software is better than the previous Family Tree Deluxe version I bought.  It allows you to better classify potential matches and decide whether to look at them later or tag them if not interested. The merging process of two databases is easier and allows you to pick what info to merge or whether to keep some info as secondary

I fell in love with another genealogy software years ago and was not happy with any newer ones when support and updates stopped for my original version.  When Ancestry updated this year I decided I had to try a new software package again that was compatible with the cool things you can now do on Ancestry so purchased this version.  I was very pleasantly surprised and happy.  I am still learning the best way to do things and occsionally get frustrated correcting info I have entered incorrectly but I would certainly recommend it.  The online checking it does and ability to attach the records found online is pretty awesome

After many years of the same look and marginal upgrades, Family Tree Maker finally made a serious change to the look and feel of the product. There are still some awkward navigation issues, but overall, I think this is worth a look if you are a long term user and haven't upgraded in a while or are just starting out. 

Having used the available online services that this company offers, I was pleased to find a new feature that integrates some of the online search functionality. Although the integration is a bit superficial, it is useful and made some of my online searches of their databases more productive. I think this is a big step in the right direction and hope they continue to add to the power of this feature as it makes the treasure trove of data they have more accessible.

Too bad they do not make a Mac version, as I prefer this to the Mac products available and so I have to use it with Parallels, which is not so convenient

I bought this a few months back and have used it quite a bit. The maps look good although i havn't noticed much change from version 2005. There are still some mistakes in the maps and they are still behind on being updated. A little slow to load on both computers but it does fine after it gets going. It has alot of nice features that make it convenient to use. The phonebook is very nice!

This anti-virus (and everything else) software was highly recommended by my company's network tech.  For stand-alone computer home use, it is significantly better than any others (especially Norton) because it is not a memory hog, so doesn't slow your machine down.

A VERY effective Internet Security package ... we installed this on my girlfriend's PC a few months ago and it's done a super job in keeping her machine trouble free.  Two thumbs up.  Effective, easy to install and use and keep updated.  A real winner.

I am so satisfied with this TrendMicro Security system, that I highly recommend it to everyone.  Without mentioning my previous system, this is TOPS!  I have never felt so secure before getting this System.
Thank you for being able to supply me with it.  I hope through word of mouth and mail, that I have caused others to go for it.  I do know of 3 people at least who are changing.
Thank you again

This edition of the color calibration hardware and software is very professional - a fact that is reflected in the price tag. However, the difference between the uncalibrated and calibrated states on a television is very noticeable.
The kit includes the colorimeter (color measurement device) with a USB connection. The assumption here is that a laptop or nearby desktop is available to calibrate the televisions. The software makes calibration extremely easy. It allows the user to select which color and picture controls the TV allows them to use (not all televisions present the same controls, and even then, they often have different names) and modifies its process accordingly. Calibration takes approximately 30-45 minutes, but the results are undeniably an improvement.
The kit comes in a sturdy plastic case with foam cutouts for the hardware and software (much like a Stargate SG-1 case for an alien device :-) ). While expensive, the software and hardware can be used on nearly anything that displays a picture - TVs of any kind and computer monitors - without limit.
The one caveat is that, for LCD and other TVs or monitors with "delicate" screens, the suction cup provided to stick the colorimeter to the device requires a good deal of force. In fact, the force required is more than I am comfortable with applying to any display I have, except CRTs. As such, calibration requires one to either hold the colorimeter to the TV for each measurement (not really a problem), or buy the tripod for the device. This is the only downside.
This device is definitely of professional quality and is a must for any home theater enthusiast or the perfectionist in your household. It might even be possible to recover the cost of the unit by becoming a calibration technician... :-

I really like OmniForm 5.  Actually I'm using version 5.1 and I'm very satisfied with it.

I was using another forms program I had purchased that was adequate but not nearly as good.  After using FormTool I have a much greater appreciation of OmniForm.

ScanSoft has been on my list of not to buy software recently  because of some of the poor performance of some of their other programs, tech support is expensive from ScanSoft and none of their software that I have used have been easy to learn using the manuals or help files.  In contrast OmniForm was well worth the money.

OmniForm 5 does a great job of either creating forms from scratch, scanning or converting from PDF.  It's the only forms program I have tried so far that actually does a great job of importing a form from a PDF file.

Its has all the tools you need to create a form starting with a blank page.  You can define any field with a variety of formats. Example you can create a date field with a specific format then no matter how the data is input the program will automatically reformat the data the way you specified.  You can create just about any field simply by dragging a symbol from a menu onto the page. In the case of inserting a graphic you can choose to have the graphic saved with the form or not saving with the form itself to conserve file size. You can have the graphic resized by the program with little loss of quality.  Features such as these might be available in other programs of this type but I found OmniForm to do the best job with creating a form field by field with the least effort.

Scanning in of a form is almost flawless.  It even recognized fields on the paper form that were meant to be circled and created the field for them.  Other programs I have used could not do this well if at all.  The only adjustments I had to make on scanned forms were sometimes OmniForm recognized text as bold when it wasn't and occasionally it would change the font. For example it would change Arial to Times New Roman on some spots of the form. Strange quirk.

To get a form imported from a PDF file you have to open the PDF file and print to OmniForm.  This is very accurate with little adjustment necessary after import. OmniForm really shines in this area.  But I did notice if the form your importing from PDF has multiple pages OmniForm will give you an out of memory error when you try to save.  To overcome this flaw you have to import one page at a time, creating a new page each time in OmniForm to make a multi page form from PDF. A little time consuming when you have a 9 page form. 

It will create a self running .exe form you can e-mail and the person on the other end can fill out the form and send it back. This works even the other person does not have OmniForm on their machine.  Because some people filter out .exe file attachments the program also creates a .html version of the form.  This is a very handy feature.

The help file is not of much use. The paper manual is better but still lacking. If you have problems tech support from ScanSoft is expensive.  But there is a user support forum you can get to through the support page on the ScanSoft web site. I have used the forum with great success.

Overall this program is a little difficult to use with some quirks and needed features like being able to import and save a multiple page form from PDF.  But well worth the effort to use as it is the most accurate forms program I have used.

I do recommend this program.  If the flaws I mentioned were corrected I would give this program 5 stars

Excellent product.  The 'over $450 value' might be a bit overstated but the packages is still an excellent value.  During installation, the 1 year free trial to [...] showed up as a 30 day trial but was resolved quickly through familytreemaker.com support and a subsequent call to ancestry.com support.  Ancestry.com provided a 1 year free trial to their US Deluxe product over the phone and didn't ask for a credit card number for renewal.  To me, that's a sign that they're a reputable company.  Some of the additional software in the package is buried on the installation CD but is worth the extra manual effort to find and install - especially the GenSmart software.

I have been using the Family Tree Maker products for a number of years.  I love its ease in the ability to add new people into the genealogy charts.  I am a little disappointed in the change that moved the screen away from looking like a tabbed folder.  I feel that the old style was a lot more user friendly, both visually and functionally

This SW is fantastic.  Having the on-line access made this product perfect, without ionline access this product would only be a storage device for family history that you already know.  I was able to get info on my family back to the 1800's in a matter of days since other relatives did all the research (relatives I don't even know).

If you're reading this. You want to upgrade, your old computer to Windows XP Professional Edition here are a few things to keep in mind. 

First thing is, you can download service pack two from Windows update. So no need to buy it integrated with XP. 

These are what I consider the minimum system requirements: 

256 MB of RAM. I have found is adequate more equals better. 
500 MHz or higher will do. 
7200 rpm hard drive will help a lot. 

If you're running Windows millennium edition, or 98 upgrade now the stability is vastly improved. Gone are the blue screens of death. 

Frequently asked question: is Windows XP Pro better than home edition? 

Windows XP Pro has a more high-end networking features that most home users will never miss or would even know were missing. So for most users Windows home edition is fine. They both are based on the same code and are almost identical. 

If you're thinking of upgrading from Windows 2000, I did, because I like the GUI interface better. But Windows XP is as stable as Windows 2000. So it's your call. 

The plug-and-play ability of Windows XP is totally great! Windows XP will by default find most drivers for video card sound cards, network cards, etc. that is such a bonus gone in the days of having to search for CDs with drivers. 

I recommend upgrading to Windows XP be a professional or home edition. It is a great operating system 

Have some fun and get it done

The product of Windows XP- Professional is just what I was looking for with many updated features and I am looking forward in using it daily.  It was shipped exacting when they had told me to expect it.  But most of all, Service was "top knotch".  I could not have asked to better service on any questions or problems I may have had. Customer service is a plus. I would not hesitate to purchase another product from this seller

First off, for people who are complaining  about installing Windows 2000, it only took my approx. 6 1/2 hours! I love it because every time I launch Internet Explorer it freezes! I also love that theres 42 spyware programs and 78 tojans on my harddrive before I even hooked up my internet. The one thing I love the most though is that I can download any movie I want. Like the recently video game adapted film Mortal Kombat! It was at full quality on my 28.8k modem and it took about 3 minutes. The blue sceen of death happens so often i just went ahead and set it as my desktop and my screensaver. I also bought the separate Ctrl Alt Del accesory pad, ive had it for about 2 days and i cant even tell what key is what anymore because i've used it so much. But all in all DOS has been a blessing, and i hope everyone embraces Windows 95 into their homes.

I think that this is a very good Operating System, but it is FAR TOO OVERPRICED!
A Note to the person who has the issue with disk#4 of his setup disk set:
Try and get access to another computer and run diskcopy, if that does't work, then boot into MS-DOS with a Windows 98SE bootdisk and select the CD-ROM Drive letter and then type "CD I386" then type "winnt" then it will start the installation from the Compact Disc.
I gave it 4 stars because i believe that they could sell a better Operating System for that price

I have been using computers since DOS 5.0 and this is by far the most user friendly, comprehensive, and powerful operating system I have used so far.  Aside from Linux, if you are interested in an easy to use, dynamic OS go with XP professional.  It has lots of features that are always coming in handy.  Unless you wanna go crazy and are an IT Power User (in which case Linux), go with this OS.  Its great

I found this upgrade has fixed some things and attempted to fix things that did not require fixing.  Hot keys that go to dockers does not speed up the work process.  It appears to be slower in handling bmps.  Larger files cause it to hesitate selecting objects.  A real memory hog.  The new contour tool makes the upgrade worthy.  So far it is not crashing like 12 did

CorelDraw was my first foray into vector graphics back when version 3 showed up on my desk at the small "Mom and Pop" screenprinting shop i worked at. Back then, Corel came with OODLES of free fonts, clipart, manuals ... not to mention FREE technical support via a toll-free number.

i stayed with Corel exclusively until version 10 ... enduring countless patches, bugs and the dreaded "odd-numbered" curse (if you tried version 5 or 7, you feel my pain). Adobe Photoshop was always my photo-editing program of choice ... CorelPhotoPAINT just never quite "did it" for me.

Industry demands eventually delegated that i delve into Adobe Illustrator. Being already familiar with Adobe Photoshop's features, tools and "look and feel", Illustrator didn't present a huge, overbearing learning curve. In Illustrator, i found the same robust features as CorelDraw ... which wasn't what impressed me about Illustrator. Adobe's intuitive programs, and their ability to interact with one another ... seamlessly ... THAT is what won me over to Illustrator. Illustrator's ability to edit/create PDF's in their native format? WOW! Exporting LAYERED vector files to Photoshop ... with layers INTACT??? WOW!!! (i could go on)

Now, that being said ... there are STILL things that i prefer in CorelDRAW compared to Illustrator. The EXTRUDE function in corel is MUCH easier to utilize. The PowerClip function is more user friendly than Illustrator's "make clipping mask" function. The ability to customize/edit/add shortcut keys is an amazing feature. (again ... i could go on)

In regards to importing and exporting files from other applications, CorelDRAW wins, hands down. It boasts a ROBUST set of import and export filters, my favorite being the .eps import filter which lets you import an .eps while converting the fonts to curves DURING the import. This is a MUST HAVE if you work with an .eps file created on another computer whose fonts you lack. If i had a dollar for every .eps that pulls into Illustrator with fonts blown out ... i'd be independently wealthy. WHY Illustrator has never implemented this is beyond me.

So, to sum it up ... CorelDRAW is a great program ... but i can't imagine it being my ONLY vector drawing program. Just like in real life, you need a great team. This program, paired with Adobe Creative Suite, meets my needs perfectly.

CorelDraw X3 is a fine product.  It has added some nice features from V-11.  CorelDraw came with a rebate and I must say Amazon failed big time in helping me apply for it...on line was a joke replied by e-mail 3 time never got a reponse...talked to reps 2 times they did not help....yes I got the product in 5 days....but if you have a small problem....Amazon aint gunna get R done

I have been a user since version 4. Version 4 was bad, 5 was good, 6 was terrible, 7 was great, tried 8 & didn't see the point, 9 was stable and very good. I avoided 10. 11 is very good. In Version 12 Corel had added features that made me want to go back to 11. 

So now here we are on X3.  Let me tell you, It has been 5 years since could say I love this program! It loads faster than 11 or 12 (and about a bizillion times faster than Adobe's Illustrator). 

It seems in this version, Corel has really given it's users a good listen because the additions to this program bring draw up to a new level of "I can harldy wait to work on a new project".

 Many of the improvments are simply little things in the way of navigation and shortcuts. Some, like the improved trace work wonderfully and seamlessly. You can go to corel's website to learn of the other improvments. I think you'll be pleased.  

This is a designer's tool that you can purchase and use with confidence.

I've been using System Mechanic 6 Professional, for about a month. I'd have to say that the overall performance of Windows XP has improved greatly since installation. Upon starting System Mechanic, a general report is given on the overall health of Windows. It fixes problems in the registry, defragments the hard-drives/ram, and boosts internet performance. All of this is done is done in a short period of time (under an hour).

I've also read all the negative reviews on Amazon. I'm not going to dispute any of them, since each user has his/her own experiences using the product. All I can say, is that I'm glad that the software worked for me.

You likely won't get the system performance improvement that is advertised unless you had a very "messy" system. But it does have a great antivirus and firewall, and if you like to be able to tweak hidden settings and know a bit more about what is going on "behind the scenes", it's an okay product. But be very careful with the cleanup tool. It will delete some important files if you are not careful!!

I have had my computer for a couple of years now, and I have always wondered if there was ever a product out there to help me rid my computer of WASTE. Well this product was recommended to me by a family member, and I am impressed as to how well it does!! I have never had so much success with one ALL-IN-ONE product as I have the System Mechanic 6 Professional, and the fact that it came with Virus Protection was and added bonus for me too. If your computer is slower than slow I definately recommend that you use this product to get rid of the Unnecessary Junk on your system, and keep up to date with the latest Viruses out there. I don't think I will ever go back to MCCAFEE again!

This book is among seminal works on system safety and safety engineering and should be read by anyone who is entering the field.  One may not necessarily agree with Prof. Leveson's views (e.g. her often unfair and unjustified dismissal of european approaches to safety engineering) but her views in the field are simply too important and influential to be ignored!
The book is a good "bed time reading" that gives an overview of the field, major problems and introduction to some major approaches.  It is however not a handbook per se - you will not understand any particular method sufficiently to apply it.
Overall, very good introductory text with a good coverage and a very easy and clear language

The computer game version of The Number Devil closely follows the book, as kids progress through sections on prime numbers, the Fibonacci series, Pascal's triangle, and an infinite series approaching one.  Nine of the ten games worked well for us, but nobody in the family was ever able to complete the tenth, the arrow game.  We understood the math, but couldn't react quickly enough to shoot down all the arrows.  This was disappointing, because we could never reach the bonus section.  All in all, though, this is a good investment for a child, 8 or up, who loves or wants to understand the mystery of numbers

I purchased Fix-It primarily to correct a registry problem. It was rated very highly on the PCWorld website. It did a great job. I had over 850 registry errors, corrected them and did a reorg on the registry. My computer is running beter now. The other utilities included work as advertised. I have been using Norton Systemworks for many years and this product is very comparable at a lower price

I don't know what other people are complaining about. I just installed Vista Ultimate a few days ago and I absolutely love it. No interface lag or any other lag at all. Maybe the people complaining have weak or outdated hardware. Those people need to turn down their settings if their not going to keep their computers on the cutting edge or at least near it. I'm glad Microsoft isn't waiting for people to catch up and are on the cutting edge. I'd rather be the one catching up than the other way around.

I have a Core 2 Duo e6300 overclocked to 2.5Ghz, 2 gigs of ram, a Geforce 7600gt and a Western Digital Raptor X 150g HD and Vista Ultimate works flawlessly on my computer. It's not the best computer but it runs flawlessly, I built it myself and all the parts cost me about $850 off the net. I play World of Warcraft among some other games and I haven't seen any problems yet with any games or any of the major software I use as of yet. I've only encountered one problem and that was with my old Soundblaster Live! 5.1 sound card which has discontinued support. No big deal, it was about time to get a better one anyway.

I think this is the best version to come out yet. I would have a high end pc if I was to upgrade only software. I would just wait and buy a new pc. Its alot easyer then learning a new operating system and if you enable the adminstrator account and only use your standard accounts to surf the web then it give you some security. The firewall is good in the business versions and there is some good virus software out there. Its got alot more features and run's good's. Device drivers are easyier to load -scott

This software was easy to install.  The Terms and Conditions of Use are very clearly stated.  I found the choice of difficulty levels greatly enhanced the product and challenged me.  The puzzles are fun and the techniques required to play are easily understood. My one wish is that there were more varied games included.... But it is a lot of fun and is definitley challenging..

Maybe it's because I was upgrading from an older version -- 2002 -- but I found the new features to be very good.

For example... the junk mail feature works better than any other I have used.  It was catching junk from the very beginning, and has missed very few things.  I have only had one thing put in the Junk folder that was not junk email.

Also the security features are far superior to the 2002 version.  And the Calendar is more flexible and easier to use.

Installation was seemless.  I think it might be a little overpriced, but considering how long I will keep it, it's not too bad

My four-year-old son loved the first Fritz and Chesster so much I just had to get the second.  I would have gotten the third installment as well, but it appears to require a DVD-Rom and more up-to-date software than he has on his computer (I suggest you always review those details before buying).  Like the first, this second installment has the same quirky and artistic sensibility and lots of amusing details that keep me as interested in it as he is.  

The first one seemed a lot more "British" than this one.  Just one example: in the first installment, the pawns are often depicted as English villagers with low-brow accents.  In this installment they are more often Texas ranchers... There were also numerous Britishisms in the first installment that were tough to understand for a child.  This one is thankfully free of them.  I suppose the American audience proved more lucrative than the original designers had expected.... 

I think the suggested age is more 6-or-above (they really should be able to read, I suppose), but with a little help even a younger child (such as my son) can get into most of the exercises and spend time with it.  There are several more advanced  features in this one than in the first installment.  Here the focus is on basic tactics, openings, and endgame situations.  So a child should really have made it through the first one before getting this.  He absolutely has to know all the rules, for instance -- the second installment is not going to teach them.  The first also has some wonderful exercises with just pawns or kings on the board, for instance, that have much to teach.  And some fun games like a maze with a monster chasing you (to teach the rook moves) or a cannon that fires diagonally (to teach the bishop).  Some of the games here (which resemble early video games, like space invaders) are a little too advanced for a four-year-old's manual dexterity....perhaps for a six-year-old's as well.  But there are many things he can get into nonetheless, especially if you take the time to explain things and get them started.

Overall, I'd say that if you want to give a child an introduction to the game, nothing beats the first Fritz and Chesster.  Other chess teaching video games are much darker and less helpful, really, for beginners.  And if he or she likes the first installment (which is also very girl-friendly), then by all means advance to the second -- especially for kids over 6

I'm not going to cover the technical drawbacks of this software except to briefly mention that you should look over other reviews before you buy.  However, despite annoying design features, this is quite an amazing piece of software!  I would certainly rate it a 5+ if there weren't some design shortcomings and undocumented features ;)

For starters, the educational intent of this software was well thought out.  Young people will certainly learn a lot about chess through using this program and they will have tremendous fun doing it!  The game teaches fairly advanced concepts in very clever and engaging ways for children of all ages and even adults.

The graphics and characters are great.  The explanations of principles are sound and they are reinforced through fun chess exercises.  The program encourages young chess players and at the same time challenges them to improve.

The product description above covers the scope of the concepts covered in detail and I found this description to be accurate so I won't repeat it.  I spent about 2 hours with a 9 year old playing the game and I had a lot of fun!

I didn't find that this program was especially difficult to use and my young friend was able to figure it out intuitively.  He also found it difficult to pull himself away and so did I.  This definitely an activity you can enjoy along with your children.

The overall concept for this teaching tool is interesting because it involves three layers of play.  There is the overall game of rescuing the king who is trapped in the castle which is used as a tool to motivate the player to learn new chess skills that allow them to progress in this higher order game.  Embedded within this larger framework are a number of clever chess teaching games where you can record high scores and learn various skills.  These can be selected from within an animated room, which gives the player some freedom of choice.  Additionally, there are other fun games that are not necessarily related to chess, but that allow the player to relax their chess concentration and refresh themselves for tackling more difficult chess skills challenges.

I also think it's good that kids could join [...] for a year and play against others as part of the purchase price.  This gives them an arena to apply their chess knowledge and is a good community that is always available.  There are other online chess communities that are free, but I still think this is a nice added bonus.

I don't think any parent could go wrong purchasing this software for their child.  It's good for hundreds or even thousands of hours of entertainment and its powered by an excellent chess engine.  However, you can't play a game of chess against the computer with it.  It is ONLY a teaching tool.  However, you can buy Fritz Grandmaster Software for about [...] which does have this capability at a very low price point compared to other products of comparable playing ability.  I've heard criticisms of Fritz 9 and my understanding is the extra cost does not add a lot of value.  In fact, at this point there seems to be some bugs with Fritz 9.

If you purchase this product, you won't be disappointed.  I wish they had it when I was learning to play chess

Learn to Play Chess with Fritz and Chesster 2, continues where the first CD left off.  Like the first CD, this program may take some guessing regarding what exactly is one supposed to do, and clicking on the crown in the upper right corner helps to navigate through the game.  

This program is really good for grasping the basic tactics and strategies because your progress is measured and you have to develop certain skill proficiency before moving to higher level and learning more tactics and strategies.

The CD covers some popular opening moves, middle game tactics like pins, forks, skewers and deflection, and mating strategies in end game.  With practice on this CD, you can begin to win some games, and then move on to Learn to Play Chess with Fritz and Chesster 3, which is out in German, and is supposed to be out soon in English

This is an excellent product for kids. My kid loves to learn with this software. I had issues installing this product. Other than installation issues, it has been excellent. We are having fun now!

I will recommend this title for kids starting on chess

Although this game maybe aimed for kids, it can still offer powerful training games in an entertaining way. Each assorted machines is like an arcade that trains each tactical aspects individually. Such as blind Chess, eye-training, memory training of chess positions are most notable that separates it from the other beginner chess training programs. 

The only thing I hate bout this game is the lack of options. You can't log off to a different username without having to shutdown the program first then relog nor can you delete usernames. No BGMs (backgroundmusic)during chess matches. 

Other than that, its an awesome tactical training tool. Kids really do love to play this game and is one of the best games out there that can get them into playing Chess. I think Chess can be a beneficial contribution to school learning and thinking process.

My children absolutely love this version. They wake at 5 a.m. to play before school. My son says "it's great--I've learned lots of tips, and now I'm a much better chess player." 

Why a 4-star and not 5? The down-side--the game doesn't allow the player to "save" at a certain level--totally frustrates the kids when they want to return, they have to start at the beginning again

My kids (6 and 8) are learning so much from Fritz and Chesster 2!!  In fact, my 6 year old daughter started winning a few games at their local chess club after graduating to this game (from Fritz and Chesster 1).  

Today I decided to play with them (since they don't like to play against each other - they're still working on that "good sportsmanship" thing), and I let them team up against me.  I was viewing this as an opportunity to help them think ahead, predict moves, and protect their pieces.  

However, I was the one who learned!!  They surprised me again and again by reciting strategies (move your bishops and knights out, save your Queen for the real battle, don't move your pawns willy nilly, break your oponnent's wall, etc...) they had learned from this game.

They also knew the relative value of the pieces, but could see advantages to making uneven swaps sometimes.  For example, they shocked me by sacrificing a bishop for a pawn in order to open a hole in my wall, which they later exploited to checkmate my  king.  This was a strategy that even 1 month ago would have been unthinkable to them.

Anyway, I defer to other more experienced chess players and computer users who have made specific comments about graphics, dialogue, and strategies.  I am sure that at some point, my kids will move beyond this game and what it has to offer.  

But for now I couldn't be happier with the Chesster and Fritz games!  My kids absolutely love playing the computer games and are really learning to play chess - and not just "computer chess", but chess that lets them beat other kids at chess club - not to mention me.  

I think I'm going to go demand a rematch :)

I bought this based on the Amazon reviews.  I am extremely new at this but the software is pretty good.  The teacher is somewhat annoying and as another reviewer said, he sings over his playing way too much.  I wish there was a way to turn him WAY down and the guitar up.  It touts having over 160 lessons, but that is somewhat misleading.  I don't doubt it has over 160 pages, but I covered 23 "lessons" in about an hour.  I do like the fact that the first few lessons he teaches you very easy versions of the chords so you don't feel hung up on doing the full chords when your fingers don't  want to move to strange new positions they aren't used to.  I am using this as well as Fender's DVD for acoustic with Keith Wyatt.  The DVD is a little more challenging for me, but Keith Wyatt is much better than the guy from the eMedia software (and he doesn't feel the need to sing!!!).  Overall, I would recommend this software

Well presented, easy to follow along, and easy to revisit previous lessons.  Videos and illustrated fretboard really help see and hear how the song should be played.  Not a lot of depth in the material but probably about the right level to maintain the attention of most students.  Some of the accompanyment/singing could be better but overall does a good job presenting the music so the student can practice along. Some of the material/songs may not be to everyones liking, but again, these are okay for the beginner.  The singing can be a slight destraction sometimes. I probably wouldn't recommend this to be the only source of learning guitar....and I don't think most people buying it would think it's all the will every need to become a great guitar player.  I'm sure a teacher would still be very advantageous especially when it comes to pointing out bad habits that may creep into the new students technique. I'm trying to learn without a teacher as well and have found other music books very useful.  
Bottom line;  This is a good product and provides a good start at learning to play the guitar.

I was sceptical about buying this product after reading one of the reveiws about having some trouble with Quicktime. Anyways, I had no problems with this program at all. Guitar is my favorite instrument. I've always wanted to learn how to play guitar. I even bought the cheap $10 dollar videos that basically rush through everything and left me frustrated, and playing the chords all wrong. This video is SO MUCH FUN!!!! I thought I could never play guitar after being so discouraged from learning from other videos. I figured, ok, this is a little more expensive, but at least I will learn how to play over 70 songs!!! I'm so happy that I bought this video. It is worth every penny. I'm currently on the 42nd lesson. Mind you, this video is not one of those "we move along quickly, so if you didn't get it, just rewind" videos. Oh no, this video makes you practice the chords many times so it's in your head. When you're done with this video, you'll feel so confindent. It's like having your own private instructor. Certain things I was doing wrong I no longer do. It has even cleaned up my fingering technique. I have no more words, it's a great video and you can't go wrong with Amazon's price.

Thank you

With 20 grandkids and 3 great grandkids, I have spent many hours with them playing games on the comptuer.  Almost all of them like all types of games, but the I Spy Series is one of the most played series that I have.  The I SPY TREASURE HUNT notes ages 6 to 10 and they must have done a lot of testing to be able to devlop a game that is actually challenging and interesting for adults,  and yet can actually be played by young kids as well.  The I Spy series has always had very hight quality games, and this is at the top of the list for me.  I will warn you though, that if you play with your kids, be prepaired to surprised. My usual play is for me to help the kids search, and not find items and tell them, but if they get stuck, point out an area to look at.  With this one, I have a seven year old that was finishing finding the last 4 or five items before I could find even one of them.  Great play for everyone.  Super recommended

I purchased this game for my 3 year old who already reads a little and knows her numbers well. I hoped this game would help her learn addition. She loves to play it, but several of the games require hand coordination beyond her ability (the hand cart one in particular, as noted by another reviewer), and catching bubbles. It was frustrating to me because she knew the proper answer but could not "execute" because her movements were too slow. Over time, she has improved enough to play most of the games on level one. The game is very engaging ang the graphics well-done, but the educational part is under-emphasized. The game that "teaches" addition involves frogs jumping to lily-pads and my daughter is so focused on the frogs that the addition lesson is hardly noticed

Finally, fresh new characters which are adorable. I am a converted Kutoka buyer as I have now bought a 3rd item from them. I was so impressed with the Mia Reading and Mia Language that I wanted to try this multi-subject game for my twin girls in kindergarten. This game is a great compliment to mia reading as it reinforces literacy and other subjects like math and problem solving. We haven't played with the art part yet but I still think it's a great value for the other subjects. I'm really impressed how it helps to develop their cognitive skills and patience as one of my girls has a problem with concentration but found through the problem solving activities that she is overcoming these difficulties. Great product. Even my neighbours kids come over to play it!

(Responding to Joel G's review below)

It's unfortunate that your child was unable to enjoy Didi & Ditto because of a technical problem you had with your computer. The majority of Didi & Ditto players are running Microsoft Windows and enjoying this great educational software.

If you send us an e-mail message at service@kutoka.com, I am sure that someone from our technical support team will be able to help you resolve the issue you seem to have experienced with your computer display.

Also note that all activites can be unlocked in the Activities menu by pressing the F6 key on your keyboard. A full list of the game's keyboard shortcuts can be found in the user's guide which is accessible from the Start menu.

Hope this helps

My 4 year old son received this as a Christmas present.  He has really enjoyed playing it so far.  He can do most of the activities without help.  There is one part where you have to ride a cart down a mountain and click buttons to duck or jump, which I think is pretty hard for little ones (it actually took me a couple of tries to make it down the mountain).  There are many different learning activities:  matching, memory, shapes, size, etc. We did not have any problems loading the game on our computer as another reviewer did.  We have a new Dell computer running on windows XP

Adobe Standard 8.0 is worth the upgrade from earlier versions. If you do research and want a better interface, design and functions then you need this new version of Adobe. It is an incredible tool for gathering, sorting, copying and formatting information. It also is faster than older versions. See details (above) on Amazon. Recommended for all information-knowledge workers

The operating system is a very good operating system for a home computer.  But, obviously, if you want a computer with more security features or networking features, you should go with Windows XP Professional.  At the time that I am writing this, which is a long time from when I purchased Windows XP, it is a time where Windows Vista is emerging.  If you plan on upgrading a slightly older computer, I recommend Windows XP Home/Professional (based on your requirements).  But if you are looking for a safe operating system for your beast, try Windows Vista.  But one word of warning about Vista, the User Account Control (UAC) is a pain in the butt

Rosetta Stone Spanish is the third major Spanish course that I am buying. 
I have comtpleted all of the Spanish lessons in the Pimsleur series, and have also completed Learning Spanish Like Crazy Level One and Two. 
I am one of those rare Latinas that did not learn Spanish from my parents. My Mexican parents felt that it would be easier to "assimilate" if I only spoke English. After going to my grandparents' home for holidays and being the only one there that did not speak Spanish, and after having Latino strangers speak to me in Spanish and then look at me in astonishment when I struggled just to say "no, hablo espanol," I felt that it was time for me to learn how to speak my language. 

The first course that I used was Pimsleur Spanish. Compared to Rosetta Stone I must say that I learned much more vocabulary with the Rosetta Stone software. But I recommend Pimsleur over Rosetta Stone, especially for the complete beginner. Because of its easy teaching method, in my opinion Pimsleur is even better than LSLC for someone that has no experience whatsoever speaking Spanish. Pimsluer goes at a very slow pace. But if you have already learned some Spanish on your own or in high school or college, then you can probably skip Pismleur and go straight to LSLC. Or if you are the type of person that believes learning a foreign language should be more like a hurdle than a marathon you'll probably want to go with Learning Spanish Like Crazy. LSLC covers a lot more Spanish words and grammar than Pimsleur and moves at a quicker pace. 

So where does Rosetta Stone fit in? 

I would say use Rosetta Stone after you have completed the above courses. It is difficult to really learn how to speak Spanish with this software alone because you are only looking at pictures and repeating the phrases that you hear. You never really learn how to think in Spanish and create your own sentences. So why am I still giving it 4 stars? 

Because if you already know how to speak some Spanish from another course and you are on an intermediate level then you can add plenty more Spanish words to your vocabulary by using the Rosetta Stone software. One negative about this course is that the method is tedious because the software's interface is "antiquated" with photos from the 1980s. And the sound quality is not as clear as Pimsleur or Learning Spanish Like Crazy. But if you stick it out through the drudgery, you will be surprised with how many Spanish words you learned with this software. 

But I think Pimsleur did a better job of teaching me concepts than this software is doing. And by teaching me concepts, I have really retained the material and by understanding concepts, I am able to take my own thoughts and form sentences. Something that I would not have been able to do if I had used this course alone. 

Another negative about this course, is that unlike the other two courses that I mentioned, you have to use Rosetta Stone while sitting in a computer. That is difficult for me because I am very busy with classes, work and my personal life. I can use Pimsleur or LSLC on my mp3 player and not have to worry about sitting at a computer. 

Besides the limited vocabulary and the slow teaching method, the only downside of Pimsleur is that it does not teach the same Spanish words that are most commonly used by Mexicans and other Latinos in regular conversation. Pimsleur Spanish is very formal Spanish. We say "mucho gusto" like LSLC teaches, Pimsleur teaches "encantado." And in our overly "macho" culture if a man responds with "encantado" many Latinos may get the wrong impression about him. It is not something that I am proud to say about my (Latino) culture, but it is true. And Pimsleur does not warn the male student that if you say "encantado" to some Latinos they may get the wrong impression about the speaker. 

Learning Spanish Like Crazy has taught me useful practical Spanish that I can use to communicate with my Spanish speaking friends and family. When I tell people that I learned to speak Spanish as an adult and not at home as a child, many of them do not believe me. I think they find it incredible for two reasons: 

One, my accent really sounds like a native Speaker from using LSLC. Two, I have learned real conversational Spanish from LSLC. I have learned words and phrases that Spanish speakers actually use when speaking to each other. PImsleur taught me Spanish that the author of the course thought that I should speak, not the Spanish that Latinos really speak. That is one of the positive things that separates LSLC course from the others. 

So in what order would I rate the three in terms of EASE of teaching method: 

1. Pimsleur Spanish 
2. Learning Spanish Like Crazy 
3. Rosetta Stone Spanish 

But in terms of teaching real conversational Spanish and teaching a real Latin American accent, I rate them as follows: 


1. Learning Spanish Like Crazy 
2. Pimsleur Spanish 
3. Rosetta Stone Spanish

This language learning software is the best I have ever tried.  You can work with the Lesson material in several different ways, utilizing your favorite method of learning.  Expecially great is the speaking unit which allows you to match your pronunciation with that of the instructor.  The package is well worth the cost

It was a relief for me to be able to keep and upgrade Word and Excel, and to get Virtual PC (for Access) as well. I used them a lot on my PC a few years ago, and when I first switched to Mac, couldn't find software that did what they did. I had no trouble installing the upgrade on my iMac G5, nor did I have trouble installing Virtual PC. The only thing that WAS disappointing was that I couldn't find out whether accessing the Internet from Virtual PC would open me up to PC-type viruses, or if Mac's Unix system would protect me there, too.  I continue to be disappointed that the Mac version of this software is not as rich as the PC version. But the upgrade itself worked well for what it was meant to do

A great bargain - you get full office Professional, VP and full version of Windows for under $300 dollars. After waiting for months and months for Office 2004 Professional to be released, when it finally came out I was ecstatic. One problem: VP 7.0 wouldn't install on my G5, only on my laptop. I called Microsoft support and within minutes they told me that they were working on a patch for machines with over 2.0 GB of ram. I downloaded the update a week later when it came out and everything is now golden. The moral of the story is that Microsoft underestimates the needs of Mac users because they are used to wimpy PCs that have no ram

The Rosetta Stone language software was a great investment. The product provides learning words together with listening, seeing, and hearing or the user can select one of these individually or even practice writing words and phrases. It provides an easy to use interface and you can learn at your own pace. The product has been worth it's hefty price. I do recommend purchasing a German/English dictionary to accompany the  software. I have also had in the past a basic German 101 course prior to using Rosetta Stone, so it may be difficult to start for a person with no knowledge of the German language, such as pronunciation of basic words or greetings

I first heard about this product in a bad review of a different software product for converting LPs to CDs.  After a little research, I decided to try this product of the many that are out there.  This software is not expensive and for me, it does what I expected it to do.  It is easy to set up and use, and I am using it with an Audio-Technica PL120 turntable.  The first LP I converted was Stevie Wonder's Innervisions, and with this album in particular, the songs run together, i.e. there is no separation between the tracks.  This software allowed me to create fairly accurate tracks so I could access individual songs.  I also cleaned up some background noise with the "one click" noise reduction, and the music from this old album sounds great.  This is my first software for this purpose so unfortunately I cannot compare it to others.  What I can tell you is that it is inexpensive, easy to use, and it does what it says it will do

I came across Magix Audio Cleaning Lab about 4 years ago.  Once I got the hang of it, I really liked it.  However, I kept wondering if there were better programs out there.  I mean, really, how good can it be for $39, right?  I recently paid $75 for Sony's famed Sound Forge Studio (which is the Sound Forge program minus various some features).  I spent a lot of time with Sound Forge Studio, working to perfect my transfer of some private music recordings from cassette to CD.  I was happy with what I was able to accomplish with Sound Forge.  At least I thought I was happy.  I compared my work in Sound Forge Studio to the same cassette transfer I did with Magix Audio Cleaning Lab 10 (the previous iteration of this software).  Guess what?  I liked the Magix work much better.  So, I immediately purchased Audio Cleaning Lab 11 and unintalled Sony's Sound Forge Studeio from my computer.  Magix could charge $150 for this software and I would buy it in a second.  Your going to have to take the time to carefully read through the full manual to get the most out of this software - but it is worth the effort.  

This program does the work of software costing 3 times as much.

The main reason for negative reviews in the past was the extra charge for the MP3 encoder. With this version, the MP3 encoder is included. Magix has been pretty clever in designing an interface that can used quickly yet has several more advanced features you can use as you become more proficient. These include a full featured waveform editor and a very powerful sonagram (spectral) editor. Also, somewhat hidden is the ability to record 78rpm records on a 33 1/3 turntable. If you use the full set of features almost any record can be made totally free of pops and clicks. I have two very minor negatives; the amplitude scale on the track display is somewhat truncated, the declicker has so few artifacts  that I recommend always using it at the maximum setting (as opposed to the wizard and manual recommendations.) As far as PC requirements, I believe any program that does a lot of number crunching needs a fairly up-to-date processor. This one particularly so because it leaves the original audio files intact. I don't believe this is a negative as in some prior reviews. In short, I have been totally satisfied with this program's ability to make clean transfers of both 78rpm and 33 1/3 rpm records.

In my opionion, Act! is clearly still the best contact manager on the market. I am not talking about a complex CRM solution, but it is a fine contact manager. I am not using the Outlook and Palm interfaces and I don't have any complains other than it is slow if you are running many programs at the same time.

The built in email features are okay, seach features are excellent. Just give it a 30 day trial and compare to Goldmine, Maximizer and others

I think this is actually a very good OS. There are a lot of new features and Home Premium appears to be the best Vista OS for the money. 
I purhased a new PC with this OS and have really found no compelling reason to upgrade to Ultimate for $150. 
Only legitimate gripe concerns drivers for non-microsoft products. Not excatly sure why this is microsoft's problem though. 
Regardless, this OS is the smart choice for a new PC for home use. Accept a minimum required graphics and audio card until suppliers catch up with this new OS. Then upgrade. Otherwise, wait till you need a new PC

If you've been living under a rock for the past year or so, perhaps you can be excused for not having heard about Microsoft's new edition to the 
Windows canon.  For all others, Vista has become a fact of life, whether or not you actually run the operating system yet.  Check out a tech website and you'll find a Vista screen shot somewhere, either depicting some impressive overclocking results via CPU-Z, or else simply for no other purpose than to show the world, "Yes, I can run Aero--aren't you jealous?"  In fact, it's hard to avoid Vista these days.  And, as always seems to be the case, most of what you hear is probably negative.

That's where I come in.  I've waited a while before writing this review, both to test the operating system and to wait for the horror stories to fade away.  They haven't.  And this can only mean one thing: the positive stories aren't getting through because most people who are satisfied with a product generally don't feel the need to comment on it.  Now of course you've probably seen quite a few anxious posts (most likely in all capital letters) either bashing Microsoft for everything under the sun, praising Vista indiscriminately, making it seem as though you need a $5000.00 enthusiast-class computer to run the thing, or boasting about Mac's venerable OS X and how Windows Vista is nothing more than a bad copy thereof.  Needless to say, none of these sorts of things helps, and all of them create a sense of confusion and negativity that reflects heavily on the product.  And, if you analyze them closely, you'll realize that *none of them actually says anything about Windows Vista.*  If you don't believe me, then just go visit Apple's discussion area and check out the iPod pages.  You'd get the impression that iPods were the worst products ever made and that every single one has problems.  Yet, if this were the case, then why have in excess of 100 million units been sold thus far?  The answer is obvious: people seem compelled to review products only if something went wrong with their experience.  In short, people confuse review sites with complaint forums.

Therefore, as the self-proclaimed Dr. Prog, I feel it my duty to step out of my usual mode of reviewing progressive rock albums and give an honest, no nonsense review of Microsoft Windows Vista Home Premium.

-THE INTERFACE-

Ah, yes.  You've heard all about the new Windows Vista Aero interface by now.  And virtually every screen shot you'll ever see will feature Aero.  But it's much more than just pretty, glass-like window frames.  Aero includes many new enhancements to the UI, such as the live thumbnails that appear when you mouse-over minimized windows.  As the name suggests, these actually update in real time, so if there is a video or an animation playing in the window, it will appear in the live thumbnail.  This is very useful.  Perhaps less useful but scoring about an 8 on the 1-10 "coolness factor" scale is the oft-mentioned 3D-Flip, which allows the user to view a three-dimensional representation of all open windows, along with offering the ability to virtually paw through these to bring the desired window to the forefront.  These are the things you'll hear the most about.

What you don't hear so much is all the general changes that have been made to the overall interface.  The new icons are photo-realistic and size-scalable.  They start out a little large, but you can set them to any size within a wide spectrum.  The explorer windows have been radically redressed, with a new breadcrumbs backward navigation tool that beats the old address bar hands down (you can retrace your steps in a logical, step-by-step manner, instead of using the cryptic addresses).  Also, they're spruced up with decorations that recall the visual aura style of some of the new wallpapers.  Speaking of which, these are for the first time actually usable, unlike in previous versions of Windows, where the wallpapers have been small and grainy.

More general changes include the absence of menu bars in most areas of Explorer, including IE.  These can be replaced momentarily with a tap of the Alt key, at least until you learn how to navigate without them.  Also, the animations are much better than in previous versions of Windows, particularly the one you see when copying a file.  In addition, the Start menu has been reworked drastically.  It doesn't even say "Start," anymore; instead, it's simply a blue orb with the Windows logo.  The first big change is the way programs are accessed: gone is the delicate and finicky ever-expanding hierarchy system, where a slightly overzealous hand could miss the mark and close the entire desired level.  Now, the All Programs button leads to an Explorer-like listing of folders, each clearly named, and each of which opens and closes with a single mouse click.  Each time the Start menu is opened, the folders reset themselves.  Also, they are automatically alphabetized.  The Start menu also contains most of the system links usually found on the Desktop (Computer, Documents, etc.), which is why the only thing on the Desktop the first time you boot up is the Recycle Bin.  And, in case you have seen screen shots or have tried out Vista already, the search bar at the bottom pulls double duty as a replacement for the Run command utility.

Speaking of search, though I seldom ever find myself wondering where my files are (I suppose I'm unique in this respect), many people have far more data to keep track of than me, and thus they will greatly appreciate the enhanced and pervasive searching facilities of Vista.  There are search boxes virtually everywhere in Explorer, including the Start menu.  There is even one in IE7, though it is not integrated with the system search.

But, as you've probably noticed, this is but a list of interface changes and additions.  I assure you the list could go on and on, and I know I'll receive more than one comment reminding me about some feature or other I've forgotten.  I'll read those when they come and add material as necessary.  But, aside from this, how does this new interface really impact the end user?  To be perfectly honest, though it's certainly pretty and a few parts of it required a little adjustment, it didn't feel much different from previous Windows versions to me.  But, to be honest, this is a good thing.  Perhaps you've heard that it's a nightmare to learn Vista.  That's a load of hogwash.  A few things are renamed, a few things have been moved around, and on the whole everything looks prettier.  But it's still Windows; it accomplishes the same tasks and it works virtually the same as it always did.

-INCLUDED SOFTWARE BUNDLE-

Taking a hint from Apple, Microsoft has included a compliment of digital media manipulation software.  While of course iLife is superior, there is one issue that must be cleared up: iLife is not an integral part of Mac OS X as you may have been led to believe.  Older Mac users must purchase it; it only comes with the newer Macs.  Therefore, Microsoft Windows Vista, to be purely technical, offers the most comprehensive digital media suite ever offered stock with an OS.  However, technicality is seldom practical, and Microsoft's inclusion is no iLife killer.  Still, the included calendar (new in Vista), photo viewing and editing application (new), Windows Media Player 11, Windows Movie Maker, and Windows DVD burning program (new) are nothing to scoff at.  No, they won't replace dedicated, professional stand-alone programs, but let's be honest: neither will iLife.

The new Internet Explorer 7 is a step forward from the piece of Swiss cheese IE6 was, insofar as security.  New features include a phishing filter, tabbed browsing, and improved security.  Additionally, IE7 runs in protected mode, also called a "sandbox."  The idea is that this one application is cordoned off from the rest of the system, thereby making it more difficult for malicious software to take control of your computer.  But that's more for the security section of the review.  The new IE7 is certainly more attractive than the older versions, and the version in Vista offers enhanced visual appeal that the XP port of the software lacks.  To be perfectly honest, I still use Mozilla Firefox (mostly because I can't stand those blinking ads on Web pages, and there is a Firefox extension that gets rid of that annoyance once and for all), but if I had to, I would have no qualms using IE7. 

The new incarnation of Window Media Player is really no different from the XP port.  It still doesn't support AAC, and it still doesn't handle gapless playback.  As an iPod user and a progressive rock fan, respectively, I can gather only one thing from these shortcomings: it's time to break out iTunes.  Don't get me wrong: WMP is not at all a bad tool.  It's still the default player on my system for most audio types.  However, once an iPod owner and prog rocker, always an iPod owner/progger.  I still say iTunes is king, if only because its interface is cleaner, it supports my audio device, and it offers gapless playback.

I haven't extensively tested the Windows Movie Maker application, but I have read that it is updated very slightly from the XP version.  The photo  editing tool is completely new for Vista, and after a little experimenting I was pleased that, though simple, the controls offer nice results.  This  application is on par with many of the basic image editing software packages you'll see offered with digital cameras, printers, and the like.  The other applications have yet to receive my testing, only because I don't often burn DVD movies, and I haven't entered an event in a calendar in about ten years.

As far as Windows Mail, I cannot be objective because I have never used Outlook or Outlook Express.  Reports seem to indicate that Windows Mail is simply a dressed-up Outlook Express, with many of the same features.  As I said, I have never used a mail program.  Call me old-fashioned, but I just check and write my mail from my Internet browser.  Either way, I don't honestly believe Microsoft would offer Outlook-level functionality in the stripped down version of Outlook 2007.

All in all, I was rather impressed at the steps Microsoft has taken to embrace the digital media age.  The effort falls short of iLife and proprietary solutions in this regard, but then, that is simply to be expected.  I haven't really benefited tremendously from the new additions, but there is certainly nothing wrong with them, and I know many people will be very happy with this digital media suite.

-SECURITY-

This is the big picking point many people (rightfully) have with Windows XP.  It seems as though there's at least two critical security updates every week.  The Mac commercials definitely have a point, but that's only because Macs make up so small a percentage of the market share (though it is indeed a growing share) that it is not advantageous for malware to be written for OS X users.  Even so, XP doesn't get a free pass here.  Something had to be done.  And that something was the security measures taken in Windows Vista.

The "sandbox" has already been mentioned above, but other features have been added.  One of these, Windows Defender (Microsoft's anti-spyware program), is one of those rare pieces of software that is just perfect: It may not be the best at what it does, but it's unobtrusive, it's simple to use, and it's totally and completely free.  Leave it on to supplement your already existing spyware solution, and you can only benefit.

Also featured in Vista is the now infamous User Account Control (UAC).  Basically, it prompts you every time your computer does basically anything, including installing programs, running some programs, updating settings, etc.  And, if you were wondering, the Mac commercials have it right: It really is that annoying.  To be fair, you will see far fewer of these alerts once the bulk of your software has been installed, but until then you will be very, very sick of UAC.  I don't advise this, but since I was able to get my anti-virus and anti-spyware software up and running on Vista, I finally turned off UAC.  Symantic seems to think this was unwise, but Norton Virus Scan doesn't bother me about it other than to recommend, on its information page, that I leave UAC activated.  Yeah.  Like that's going to happen.

Beyond these broad, tangible aspects of security, there is a lot of new stuff under the hood of Vista that makes it less susceptible to malicious attacks.  Mostly, unless you're very savvy, you don't need to understand it all and, to be frank, don't ask me because I haven't the foggiest how it all works.  I'm just glad it's there.

Overall, I think Microsoft has made a valiant effort with security.  I would still not advise running any Windows operating system without active virus and spyware protection, but at least Vista has taken a step in the right direction.  Plus, you likely have anti-virus and anti-spyware software from running Windows XP, which you can then install on Vista.

-THE HARDWARE-

Graphics:

This is the part I have been waiting for.  Everything I read up until I finally installed Vista told me I needed a dedicated graphics card with at least 256 MB of memory in order to run Aero.  I'll be honest: I fell for it.  I had a graphics card *in my hand*, but on the way to the checkout I realized I had left my gift certificate at home.  So I decided to wait and see how my hardware would react.  This is where I realized the utter bias among the tech community: I had absolutely no trouble running Aero on integrated graphics.  And that only makes sense because my setup is rather typical: a 17" flat panel monitor and a modern computer.  This will be what the majority of people have at the moment, and at this size, IG should have no trouble running Aero.  Now use logic: If you want to run dual 24" widescreen monitors, yeah, you'll need a graphics card.  Especially since I don't believe there even exists a dual monitor-capable IG motherboard (if there is such a thing, it's certainly not available on the OEM consumer market).  But if you have a fairly typical single monitor scenario on a computer that you bought within the past few years, you should have no trouble at all insofar as graphics.  Don't be fooled.  If you want to be absolutely sure, however, there is no harm--and plenty of good sense--in downloading Microsoft's free Upgrade Advisor utility to see if your setup is in any way deficient.  Plus, if you find you can't run Aero for any reason, you were going to upgrade to Vista anyway, so you  can still buy dedicated graphics at that point.  You don't need the top-of-the-line card unless you want to make this an excuse to foray into gaming; older technology that will get you up and running can be had for very reasonable prices.

RAM:

There is one area, however, where many computers will be deficient: RAM.  Oddly enough, while many sources are pushing the graphics card brigade, an almost equally strong force--the computer manufacturers themselves--seems to think that RAM is no big deal.  Trust me: If you've ever tried to run Windows XP on 256 MB of RAM, it's a painful experience.  That's what Vista is like on 512 MB--you don't even want to go there.  Dell is shockingly honest when they qualify the "minimum" Vista requirement of 512 MB of RAM (as per Microsoft) as "Great for booting the operating system, without running any applications or games."  This is where most people will have to upgrade their machines.  1 GB is perfectly acceptable; if you want true multitasking power (and you have the dual-core processor to support it), then go for 2 GB or more.  For most people, however, 1 GB will be fine.  My first of two Vista machines has 1 GB and it works perfectly.  I will warn you, though, that often times memory is installed in pairs, so your 512 MB is most likely two 256 MB modules.  The paired method offers better performance, but it will make upgrading a system with only two memory slots somewhat expensive (though not exorbitant by any means).  But this is not somewhere you want to skimp, so at least one pair of 512 MB memory modules should be on your list of extra hardware if you have only 512 MB of memory currently installed.

Processor:

This is perhaps the most accurate in terms of the hype.  You'll need at least a 1 GHz processor to run Aero.  Many computers with such processors don't even support 1 GB of RAM, so if you're in that situation, you will definitely be looking at a new computer with Vista pre-installed.  However, these are very old machines by this point, and most of us have something slightly newer.  One myth that needs to be dispelled is that dual-core processors will run Vista better than single-core CPUs: Vista is, for the most part, based on the Microsoft Server 2003 code, which is, in turn, based on the XP code, both of which came before the advent of multi-core processing.  Therefore, to the effect that the operating system is run, there will be only a marginal difference between a single-core or a dual-core CPU, provided both use identical core architectures.  Of course any applications that take advantage of multi-threading will benefit from multiple cores, but this was, is, and will always be the case, independent of the operating system.  The question is simply whether you see yourself multitasking more with Vista.  If that's the case, then a new computer with a dual-core processor installed is probably your best bet; if you're fine with your current setup, then it will most likely run Vista and Aero without any problems.  It is interesting to note, however, that some upgrade aptitude utilities have some small quirks and will give conflicting and non-real results.  For example, such a utility offered by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) passed both my A64 X2-based machines without a hitch.  However, when on a whim I ran it on my old P4-based desktop, the utility seemed to think that a 2.40B GHz Pentium 4 Northwood (533 FSB) would be insufficient to run Vista.  I smell AMD bias, even though I happen to favor AMD over Intel.  Just take what such utilities tell you with a grain of salt, and remember that Microsoft's own utility is likely the most reliable.  Generally, your processor will not be an issue when upgrading to Vista.

Hard Drive:

Again, this one is pretty straightforward.  If you have a 40 GB hard drive or better, you're good to go.  And if you don't have that, hard drives are so cheap these days that you could easily at least triple your current capacity for about what it costs to take the family out to dinner one evening (Amazon does not allow price figures, hence my vagueness regarding pricing throughout this review).

Things get interesting when you consider a dual boot scenario.  This is when you have two operating systems running on the same system, either on the same or on different hard drives.  In my honest opinion, this is the best way to go because you get to keep your current operating system (just in case you run into problems with Vista), and you also get to have Vista.  Keep in mind that, in order to run Vista on the same hard drive as your current OS, you'll need to install each OS on a separate partition.  You can either purchase a third party partitioning tool, or do what I did, which was use the Ubuntu Linux live boot disc's built-in partitioning utility.  Of course there is risk involved with this last solution (but, in my experience, I've used it dozens of times with no problems), so do the latter only at your own risk.

-COMPATIBILITY-

This is where most of the horror stories have come from.  Both hardware and software compatibility nightmares are flitting around in denser clusters than fish flies in June.  Up until recently, anti-virus and anti-spyware programs have been unable to install on Vista.  In addition, many proprietary printer applications are incompatible, yet the printer itself will often times function perfectly.  Graphics and sound card drivers still haven't really caught up, despite the fact that they've had a little over two years to do so.  I won't deny that, if your system just happens to roll the snake eyes, you're in for some hell.

But it's not half as bad as you hear.  I installed Vista without a hitch; there is a separate part of the process where the OS scans the system for hardware, installs the necessary drivers, and then generates a list of anything that doesn't install properly.  Every piece of hardware I had was recognized.  In addition, my printer was recognized and installed in about five seconds, despite the fact that its own software would not install (and that its maker, HP, still hadn't posted a Vista-compatible version).  Even my USB Internet modem, which the Upgrade Advisor flat out said would not work with Vista, installed and ran perfectly when I supplied the drivers from the manufacturer's website.  The fact is, Vista has shipped with exponentially more drivers than any edition of XP.  Plus, it's possible to supply drivers from manufacturers' websites for the odd, esoteric bit of hardware that isn't immediately detected.  Sometimes it will work, sometimes not.  But this is only to be expected when upgrading to a new OS.  I don't seem to remember everything being rosy when XP came out, either.  This is yet another item of strong support for a dual boot scenario.

Software is no different from hardware.  All my software titles, with the possible exception of the ancient original Roller Coaster Tycoon, work flawlessly with Vista.  And the latter didn't work with Windows XP MCE 2005, either, so I don't blame Vista for this.  If your software acts buggy or otherwise just won't work, check the manufacturer's website.  If it's a fairly recent title, there will most likely be some compatibility patches or a whole new version of the application, all free of charge.  Just be ready to insert your product key, if required, in the latter case.  Now of course chances are that if you have some pet application from the mid-nineties, it might kick up a few Dickens.  Again, a strong case for dual boot.

The final and perhaps most prolific source of upgrade hell is, ironically, the upgrade itself.  This process works by performing an in-place upgrade of an already existing operating system (XP).  These sorts of upgrades are notorious for problems, and the Vista crop is no exception.  However, since you're currently viewing the full version page, this obviously isn't an issue for you.  Just remember, the best ways to install Vista are either as a clean installation (if necessary obliterating an existing OS) or a dual boot scenario.  Anything else and you might experience problems.  But this has always been the case with in-place upgrades.

-OVERALL-

I thank you for reading this far.  Most people won't.  I know this was pretty long, but I wanted to get it all out there for people to read.  Vista is not a bad operating system.  Was I absolutely floored with it?  It may require some more time, but it hasn't been the revelation Microsoft promised.  This is somewhat disappointing, and yet, somewhat reassuring as well.  I didn't suffer any downtime because I couldn't figure out how the operating system works, I didn't have any glaring compatibility issues, and my computer has worked virtually error-free ever since I first installed the OS. In short, the change, while not mind blowing, wasn't drastic or disturbing, either.  At the end of the day, just remember: It's Windows.  Love it or leave it, it's just Microsoft's operating system.  Vista will do the same thing as XP and earlier editions; it's not a source of inspiration or drive.  It's only as good as the person who's using it.

I am a retired attorney who has experimented with earlier versions of the Dragon software over the last eight to 10 years.  I was never quite satisfied with the performance of the product.  However, I now own version 9 and have found it to be a very useful and accurate product.  If I were still practicing law, I would unquestionably utilize a program like this in my practice.  Because I did not like being tied to my computer by a microphone cable, I purchased a wireless microphone (by Nady - which I have also reviewed) which works even better than the wired headset that came with the program.  The program required less than one-half hour of setup although I have continued to train the program to meet the needs of my particular voice patterns.  This dictation is much more accurate than my typing, and I have found that correcting errors is a fairly simple process as well.  My only regret is that I purchased the basic program, rather than an advanced program.  Now that I see how well the product works, I wish that I had a more specialized vocabulary and the ability to dictate in more than just English as I am fluent in Spanish and have a growing acquaintance with French.  Incidentally, I dictated this review and use the dictation program regularly to respond to and send e-mails, as well as dictate letters, memoranda and outlines in Microsoft word.  It may be relevant to note that I am not using an underpowered computer system.  I have an AMD dual core system with 2 MB of RAM.  I am certain that there is a combination of good programming and growing computer power that makes a program such as this functional

Voice recognition software continues to improve.  I've been using versions of this software since 1998 and can see significant improvements in the voice recognition technology over that period.

Before investing in this software, though, check carefully the specifications of your PC.  The faster the processor and the more RAM you have, the better the results.  The software will run on the minimum specification identified, but it may not run fast enough to satisfy the needs of some us.

This software is useful in many circumstances.  Many of us can speak faster than we can type and many of us compose as we type.  The software can be used with a range of eMail clients as well as in word processing and other software.  

You can, as it claims, obtain reasonable voice recognition results with a few minutes of set up and training.  But for optimal use, and the best return on investment, consider using the voice command capabilities to drive other software.  This takes more effort initially but can deliver significant benefits.

I'll be buying a new PC before I look at upgrading this software.

Highly recommended.

I have been aware of NaturallySpeaking for over 15 years.  We initially utilized this software to assist people with severe disabilities such as cerebral palsy to be able to have basic commands understood.  More recently five years ago I bought edition 4.0.  I found it to be frustrating when ever there was any background noise so I basically quit using it.  When I saw the 8.0 being advertised as the voice recognition software specifically for a small business atmosphere, I thought I would try it one more time.  Being a slow typist it has truly changed my life for the better.  Only 45 minutes were required to set up the speech-recognition files when the occasional mistakes occur during dictation if you correct those and change those right at that time, I never see that same misunderstanding happening again.  I have recommended it to two friends who are buying it.  It really does allow you to sit back in your chair relax, drink your coffee and dictate reports, answer e-mail or whenever it is you might need to do.  I can't think of any $70 expenditure that has given me so much back in such a short time.  I almost always have my headset on when I'm in front of the computer because anything that involves typing or entering data I used the DragonDictate to do

I only installed the product two days ago and have not really been able to give it a solid workout. That said, my initial take is very positive. As a writer and lousy typist, I think it will increase my productivity expotentially. I look forward to really getting into the nuts and bolts of the product very soon

I checked the reviews on many types of dictation software before selecting Dragon NaturallySpeaking 8 standard.  I recently had my wrist operated on and knew that I would be unable to write utilizing my hand for quite a while.  As an online student going to college I had to be able to participate in discussion boards and research papers daily.  This software was unbelievably easy to learn.  I followed the directions on setting it up so that the computer would recognize my voice.  I spent approximately 5 hours learning to program, and practicing before I was operated on.  I found that if I talked at my own natural speed the computer utilizing this software did an excellent job of deciphering my words.  I found the instructions very simple to follow.  Yes there were times that the computer displayed what I said incorrectly, but correcting it was extremely easy.
I was able to keep up with my class throughout the six weeks I was in a cast.  My arm is still in a brace and I'm still using the software on a daily basis.  I'm actually using the software to write this review.  I highly recommend this software to anyone that needs to write research papers or that does a lot of computer typing on a daily basis.
I am such a strong believer in the software that I know I will continue to use it even when my brace comes off.
I found the software very compatible and easy to use even to answer my e-mails quickly and efficiently.
This might be the perfect software to get for any college student.  To be able to look at research books and talk into the computer as you're looking up reference material is truly beneficial.  It was also very easy to stop Dragon software when you needed to to take a break think what you needed to write next.  All I needed to say was "go to sleep" and the microphone shuts off until you wake it out.
To sum it all up the software was very easy to use and easy to set up.  I recommend it highly.

In my experience really learning a language requires a mix of learning approaches. That means books, tapes, tutoring, and experience in a country that uses it. I have done all of these and feel this product is well worth including in the mix. I highly reccomend it. If you're serious you need to just pony up the money and use it.

We ordered this program only two weeks before moving to Bogota, Columbia for a two year tour.  However, the Spanish Rosetta Stone taught was much higher level than the survival Spanish we needed when we arrived.  Overall we are learning the language and it is a GREAT program.  Wish we would have bought it 3 or 4 months before departing

I have used this software for about 4 weeks since posting my comment in reply to that review.  Having now had a chance to use the software, I can only say that I am almost 100% satisfied with it.  Some times, it's nice to have a spanish dictionary when after a few lessons, you still can't quite grasp the concept of the word you're being taught, but other than that...

Yes, it is repetitious.  For those who want to learn another language, this is to be expected.  No, it's not a magic pill.

However, in as little as three weeks I found myself largely able to understand what native speakers around me were talking about, even if my understanding of it was imperfect.

Repetition (as they say) is key, but even if it were not, dedication is absolutely required.  You can only learn if you stick with the program, and even I have been rather lax about that much.  Still, I am wholly satisfied with my purchase.  It is clear to me that the program is only as good as its user though, and I really ought to be more dedicated to following it

If you are serious about learning Spanish this software isn't enough. You will need to purchase a Spanish-English dictionary - I like Barron's Spanish Dictionary because it came with a free down loadable software version - and a Spanish audio series such as Pimsleur or Learning Spanish Like Crazy (LSLC). A verb conjugation book is a good idea too, I like The big Red Book of 555 Spanish Verbs. Finally, just like back in the day, you should either buy flashcards or create your own to build up your vocabulary when you can't stand to look at the computer monitor even one second longer.

Now here's the part of the puzzle that Rosetta Stone will help you with: it is very repetitive and requires interaction with picture/word association. I have found that this burns the words into my mind and that the photos help me to recall a word or phrase. Rosetta Stone will also help you with reading comprehension as well as spelling - as long as you use all the lesson plans and resist the temptation to just do the fun parts. But the speech recognition feature is not as good at teaching you to speak Spanish as a high quality audio series such as Pimsleur or LSLC. 

The advantage of the speech recognition is that you can slow down the word or phrase being spoken. So if you want to slow down the word "mujer" you can hear how the native speaker uses the hard H sound on the J and a slight roll on the last R; it's great for pronunciation but not effective for learning how to handle yourself in a conversation.

In summary, Rosetta Stone is not a one stop shop. It isn't as mobile as an audio series on your iPod. And it isn't going to make learning Spanish a thoughtless and easy task. I recommend that you buy this software and use it but understand that you are paying $500 primarily for word/picture association and the ability to analyze your pronunciation of individual words and phrases. Also, keep your Spanish dictionary handy to alleviate any confusion. The whole childlike learning approach is good, but your adult skills will definitely help to speed up the process.

As the editor of the Learning Spanish Products Reviews (LearningSpanishProductsReviews) site, one of my responsibilities is to review learning-Spanish software products that are listed on Amazon. I am also a native Spanish speaker and a professional Spanish instructor. 

Rosetta Stone Spanish is a great Learning Spanish product for a child or pre-teenager that wants to learn Spanish. This software features native speakers, real-life images, and a speech recognition feature. Your child or pre-teenager will find that this software is lots of fun. But the photographs do appear to be from at least two decades ago. 

I'd actually give this product 5 stars as a tool for teaching a child or pre-teenager Spanish. But as a learning-Spanish product for an adult the effectiveness of the product really depends on whether the adult is a visual learner or not. 

My advice is for you to also experiment with some of the auditory or auditory/text based comprehensive Spanish courses sold on Amazon, and decide if you are primarily a visual or auditory (or auditory/text) learner. Even if you determine that you learn better with or an auditory Spanish course you can still get good results with Rosetta Stone Spanish, by using it to complement your main auditory home-study Spanish course. You may also find the Rosetta Stone software helpful if you're an adult that has one or more of the major comprehensive auditory courses under your belt, and now you are merely seeking to expand your vocabulary.

I don't understand why testing for each language exercise is not the default selection instead of having to select it.  It is frustrating to go through an entire exercise hoping to see how well you did....and realize that you forgot to select "test" at the beginning.  Also, it seems that testing should be available for the 'guided exercise' also ...... not just the regular exercises.  Other than these two things, the program is very good

I recently purchased the anime studio 5 but not the
pro version, which costs 150 more and gives more functionality.

This is a fully functioning animation software, with lots of 
interesting features. I can see no reason that a novice
animator such as I am would not be happy with this software.

I would like to see more energy put into a manual, but you 
can scavenge the anime blog/chat site to find answers, or
google other places.  With a more robust manual, this would
be 5 stars, not 4.  It is really the reason I am reluctant
to upgrade to Pro, because I would want more lessons and
tutorials to go along with the upgrade. 

If you have an interest in animating, this is the software 
for you.

Turbo Tax Deluxe is an excellent product but they should make it easier for you to back up without having to go thorugh the whole category to get to one item.
Also they should make it easier to make adjustments to your state return. It's very annoying to find and adjust the State Return once you have gone back into your Federal Return.
I think it is a very good product BUT they should make it much easier to navigate to other areas ESPECIALLY for the STATE RETURN

This product did an excellent job of figuring our taxes.  This is the first time we've tried something like this and found it very easy to follow and complete.  You can go back and change things or review them, it gives you a way to e-file, you can print out all the copies that you may need.  I was surprised how easy it was to use.  However it took us a long time because we read all the items very carefully and double checked everything but it saved us a lot of money from what we used to pay our tax preparer.  I was very happy with it

My legal ofice bought this product specifically for making unfillable PDF forms fillable.  This feature works much better than we expected.  I anticipated we would have to do a lot of clean-up to make the forms useable.  That is not the case.  About 80% of the forms we run through it come out perfectly.  It seems to have trouble with forms that are really crowded with fields or have embedded fonts that we don't have access to.  Designing fillable forms from scratch used to take us hours for a simple form.  I could see most of the forms we use taking 6-8 hours each.  Running it through the FormTyper takes a few seconds.  The amount of time we save on this one task is tremendous.  We have also begin using the OCR capabilites to create digitial documents from our paper files.  The OCR seems to work really well, even with multi-generation copies.  We are very pleased with the performance of this product.

This software came with a scanner I recently purchased and I decided to upgrade from the "SE"(striped edition?)that was bundled with the device. Considering the cost and what the software can do it is an amazing value. By simply using this software to re-create documents instead of retyping them is saving me more an hour or two a day. I was hesitant to puchse it based upon all the recent negative reviews, but decided with the 30 day refund policy I could try it risk free. I'm glad I did. The software worked flawlessly for me - even on 5th and 6th generation copies that were hard to read with my naked eye 
(and I don't need or wear glasses). I'm not sure what those people that were scanning books were trying to accomplish, but when I scanned some pages from an encyclopedia for my son the OCR worked great!  Try it and if it doesn't work then return it.

I have been using OmniPage for several years at my law office and found that the OCR with this version is impeccable.  I frequently scan and OCR newspaper and magazine articles.  They are multi-column and the magazine articles typically have graphics and tables or charts.  When i convert them into Word documents I seldom get any formating errors.  In fact, because the OCR is so good I have set up a batch process to run at night to OCR all the day's work so my computer resoiurces aren't being taxed when I am in the office working.  Way to go Nuance

The very early years of optical character recognition (OCR) were quite the challenge.  Programs cost thousands of dollars, as did the scanners.  None of them worked very well.  It would take longer to "clean up" the document after scanning than it would for the secretary to have typed it in from scratch.  All of that has of course now changed, and Omnipage 15 Pro takes the art and craft to a new level.

I have been using the Omnipage product for the last seven years or so.  I use it my law office (along with a number of the other Scansoft, now Nuance, suite of products) on a daily basis, many times through out the day. We use it to chew up everything from court pleadings, to 100 page plus contracts, to real estate property descriptions, which must be accurate down to the comma and semicolon.  Our needs are fairly simple - get the text into the word processor so we can respond on behalf of our client as fast as possible. 

OP15Pro offers a significant performance increase over its predecessor version 14.  It is faster (very much faster) and more accurate.  Work flow is straight forward.  There is of course the ability to manually set or readjust recognition zones, recognize and format as spreadsheets.  This new version easily handles text in relation to graphic elements and does a good job of keeping them all together in their right places.  Like most everything else, and especially with computers and software, nothing is perfect and there are times that OP15 misses a mark.  It is however, for the most part, very accurate and efficient, but remember, the old rule of "garbage in equals garbage out" still applies.  We have recently started taking pen scanner images of documents in the books at the local registries of deeds.  These are 200 dpi scans of documents that themselves are old photocopies of text placed on paper with IBM Selectrics or worse.  In other words, stuff from the dark ages of the 1970's and before.  We were pleasantly surprised at how well OP15Pro performed. With these very old images there is a need to clean them up, but nowhere near what it used to be.

I will comment only briefly about the company's tech support.  There has always been enough information provided to get the software up and running. The key, of course, is to read and follow the directions.  A task that is sometimes difficult in this "I want it now world." 

The one "free call" is not just for installation problems, but can come months or even years after the product is purchased.  I have also found on occasion that tech support will often answer the simple and obvious questions without first asking for the credit card.  Solving technical problems can be frustrating and time consuming.  Considering what the software is attempting to do, there fact that it accomplishes it at all seems at times to be just short of a miracle. Lastly, the company's knowledge base is filled problem solving information.  There is also a tremendously large user base that supports the product through Usenet and other forums.

We have used ScanSoft/Nuance products for over five years - As a matter of fact I am writing this review using Dragon 8. OmniPage Pro 15 along with the PDF converter is by far the best on the market. The technical support has been fantastic throughout the years and the engineers always had open ears for recommended changes. OmniPage Pro 15 has saved me thousands of dollars because of its unbelievable OCR accuracy.  With a click and a choice I can now convert a PDF document into XL as spreadsheet.  Before this technology was created it was such a hassle. When I have to fill out a form OmniPage Pro 15 uses the saved information to help me. The program can run in the background and does not freeze or slow down my system.

If you're looking to create the next Doom 3 or Half-Life 2, then I can't really recommend this program. If you want to make an advanced FPS game, or a simple pong game, then I can recommend Dark Basic. In fact, Dark Basic Professional is probably capable of creating any kind of game that you can come up with. The catch? You have to program it yourself, all from scratch. Dark Basic makes manipulating 3D data extremely easy, but it's not a game creation package which lets you click and create. If you are determined enough, it's easy to learn all of Dark Basic's commands, as half of programming a game is in the logic. Dark Basic will hardly limit you, and will give you capabilities that were probably impossibly hard for you to use in C++. The end result of creating a game from scratch results in a tremendous sense of satisfaction, especially when you share it with friends and family. Although previous versions of Dark Basic Professional had some hardly crippling bugs, most of them have been eliminated, and with the release of upgrade 6.0, DBPro is a very stable development engine. Overall, I totally recommend this to anyone who wants to create a game, but is determined enough to learn how

I give the DB Pro 5 stars, but I am totally disappointed in Amazon.com and The Gamecreaters, heres why

The first thing I noticed is my box is different than that shown here... http://darkbasicpro.thegamecreators.com

I didnt recieve any of the free software stated in the link above

I cant find the 
Over 45 Demo's
Over 25 Tutorials
Over 600 Textures
Over 120 Sound Effects
900 3D Models 
That is stated here...
http://darkbasic.thegamecreators.com/

I applied the .59 upgrade patch and now my program wont start. It says its missing MSVCR71.dll file.

The original version was 1.05

I cant believe the darkbasic.com is advertising this product, yet Amazon.com is shipping some ancient version. Hopefully I will be able to resolve this issue..

Purchased this software to transfer files and operating system from on old laptop hard drive to a new one.  I put the new drive in a USB external case attached it to the laptop and ran the software.  In about 20 minutes and 3 mouse clicks the operation was completed and worked perfectly.  I have also used the software to image my hard drive as a backup.  

The menus are easy to use making all available tasks straight forward

You will probably read 50/50 from the reviews on this software.  Having used the older Poser software... One thing I am a fan of is Miki and Terai Yuki...Japanese virtual beauties and if you are a fan of Japanese styled video games and the character designs, the fact that e-frontier is now the company behind Poser 6, I'm so stoked.

Granted, the software with bundles (best to buy it bundled with other cool software), there is a free software out called Daz3D.  Daz3D content creators make stuff for Daz3D and Poser and vice versa but no matter if you go with the free program or Poser 6, the result will be the same...expect to pay money for content.

I highly recommend getting the book "Pratical Poser 6" because it's very, very informative unlike the manual. Next thing...before you buy...mosey down to daz3d.com, contentparadise.com, renderosity.com and ask yourself, can you afford to buy the content.  Content costs anywhere from free to over $100+.  

And the good stuff costs money...maybe not a lot but it does add up.  The next thing to know is that after you buy the content, due to how the hair or clothing conforms to the body (or how it's placed), they are not organized.  To make matters worse is that the names that the creators have called their work are long that the window for the selections (Figure, Pose, Hair, Prop, etc.) can get cut off and so, it becomes a bit of a choir to go back and forth to certain folders.

But I got used to it and the thing is ....all developers for the content are helpful.  Content Paradise is a great place to buy your content as well as from the creators websites as well.

There is a lot of trial and error and I wish there were more undos...because really, although there is an undo...you mess up...you can't just undo...you have to start over your from your save file (and hopefully you saved).  

Nevertheless, the stuff I was able to create in Poser is wonderful.  I will say that I have spent a lot not just on the Poser and the bundle but the content.  It adds up quickly!!!  So, consider the benefits for you.  Although I love the characters from Daz3D and the ever popular Foxhair,  I'm more a fan for Poser but still expect to be buying content from Dax3D for use of poser.

**things i liked about the program

it supports importing ojb files, that i make in different modeling programs

the walking path editor works not too bad for simulated walking

and the rigs have good looking emontions when you moves there face features


**what i found to be not so good

the tabs such as the library and keyframe bar are kind of hidden on the side because of his small they are.  

I find the slection tool in the hair room to be alittle bit annoying when trying to grow dynamic hair groups. i most of the time end up growing hair on too many facets.  

the control points are too senative, they end up twisting the body in un-natrual forms. 

the rendering takes a very long, and the rendering shader doesent always save my settings. i end up transporting the animation to another program to render faster. 

some of the cloths i cant set them up to be childern to the body parts so they end up not being connected to anything. 


i'm sure there more on my mind by i dont have much time to write up an review. just keep in mind 3d animation isnt perfectly easy. a good modeling programs to make OBJ files will go a long way.

I like the way the program goes through the tax forms as if you are interviewing with a tax preparer. However, I think it needs to do a better job of explaining why a tax form cannot be emailed and how to address that issue

I started off using Turbotax this year, but returned it to the store to use Taxcut instead. I purchased this version because it was a bargain, and it's easy enough to do state taxes by hand (or for free on the state website for those states that have that option).

I did have some difficulty with the update process, which was frustrating at first. However, I found Taxcut's website to be helpful on this point, and I determined that my firewall was the problem. I was able to update the product once I followed their instructions.

One key difference between Turbotax and Taxcut was that Taxcut is not integrated with as many companies. Whereas I could automatically download my W-2 and most of my 1099 forms into Turbotax, they needed to be manually entered with Taxcut. This wasn't a huge issue, but one difference people might want to know.

I completed and e-filed multiple federal returns, which worked great, and the e-file charge was reasonable ($15.95). However, I don't suggest having the e-file charge taken out of your refund. Apparently, there's an extra charge (I think $25) for this service. It's more efficient and less expensive to just pay the fee with a credit card.

Now to the software itself. I found it easy to navigate and enter information. I was a bit disappointed in the deduction section. Many of the fields were too short for me to enter complete names and addresses of charities, which I found frustrating. However, the calculations were accurate. I checked Taxcut's calculations regarding AMT, and they were excellent (Turbotax's calculations were wrong). In the second return I completed, the taxpayer was eligible for EIC, and Taxcut accurately identified this and did the proper calculations here as well.

Overall, I was very satisfied with the product, and will use it again next year. I will make suggestions to Taxcut, and hope they will improve their support for automatic download of forms and longer fields for charitable deductions. However, even without these changes, the product is an exceptional value

Purchased this edition of TaxCut last week.  On WIN XP2 the software installed cleanly and it downloaded the updates without any issues.  I imported last year's data in less than a minute and I had my return completed in less than 1 hour.  This includes capital gains/losses, dividends, and AMT calculations.  It doesn't get much easier than this.
Yes, you have to download updates.  The IRS is still making changes to the tax codes long after this software has to be packaged and sent to the stores.  The alternative would be to download the whole package online when you buy it, but wouldn't that take at least as long

It is a little bit clumsey. When I go to it, instead of my cursor being in the space where I write the word for a definition, I have to place it there and that takes time. The first one of these electronic dictionaries I had (about 5 years ago) was fabulous, it was called "deluxe" and had everything, but my computer outgrew ot amd the makers have never bothered to bring it up to date and offer it again.

Compared to FP 2000 and earlier versions, it offered some major improvements, even letting one code in (gasp) PHP with live preview - it is highly configurable, and easily tied into SharePoint (well, I think that was the intent).  

It was quite an evolution, moving beyond FP2000, with some fairly advanced features - while still retaining the "entry level, small business learnable" functionality (albeit cookie cutter designs) of previous versions.  

I was surprised to find it even offered options to strip out all code that hinted this site was made with FrontPage (an odd change, knowing MS), but also offered other code functions, some on par with Dreamweaver - but do not mistake this for Dreamweaver, even the first MX version.  It's still aimed at Microsoft only - you really have to dig and tweak to configure it for anything else (e.g, php, cold fusion) - but it does offer some major improvements for flexibility over previous versions.  Mostly good, some horribly bad.

The good - being able to tweak it to dozens of standards' compliance, Sec. 508, XML'ish stuff, whatever.  By default these things are not set up, so it does take some learning.  

What annoyed (and freaked me out) was that while it easily allowed for desktop development with Access, to create database driven sites - the database had to remain in a public folder - ok, I suppose if you're using it only on an intranet.  

I believe the point was to code with Access, then mod it slightly to interact with SQL server - but most folks probaby did not use it that way - knowing the history and "fire and forget" ease of use of FrontPage... 

Anyhow, I'd call this a para-professional version. It has way more flexibility and functionality than any version of Frontpage, ever.  It is also going bye-bye.  

There will not be a FrontPage 2007, due to the switch to Expression Web (which retains some FP functionality, but the "friendly" and pesky "bots" are gone).  No more email bots, whatever bots - gotta learn how to roll your own.

I purchased this software mainly for Web Design.  I am beginning in Web Design and found Microsoft Frontpage 200 easy to learn with a lot
of interesting features to design a web site.  I would definitely recommend this product

Frontpage 2003 is a great, easy-to-use WYSIWYG web builder.  Most hosting companies support Frontpage extensions, a set of web robots to help you build a dynamic site, similar to DHTML.

Two warnings, though:

1) This full version is too expensive; you may qualify to buy the half-priced Academic Version (search for "frontpage 2003 academic" on Amazon);

2) More important, though, Frontpage is being discontinued as a product altogether and will be replaced by Office SharePoint Designer (for businesses) and Expression Web (for everyone else).  You can download the latter for free (for now, at least) on MSFT's website

Given my limited knowledge of computer science and programming i felt FrontPage was a a really big help. I was able to get a website up and running in about 2 weeks which i think is pretty good all things considering. I didn't realize though that Frontpage isn't the cureall for making a website really. Primarily only for WEB DESIGN i.e. if you want to make a website with E-commerce and query searches of an inventory database and the like, you're gonna need to bring in the professional programmers in any event to program in ASP or PHP. But as far as Web Design goes Frontpage can take a novice a long way.

The hard-copy of Britannica has been the standard in reference for centuries, now you can have all of that, with video, audio, tons of photos, and extra support from the web for a fraction of the price of the original.  For what you get, it's an incredible deal and an indispensable part of any reference library

I trust the information I find from Britannica and so invested in the 2007 Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite.

It has something for everyone.

I use it side by side with Microsoft Encarta and together I get a more complete subject review.

I prefer the content of Britannica but for ease of use Encarta is still superior.


I look forward to Britannica making the interface and ease of use better in future productions and that is why I am only able to award 4 stars

If you want a simple to use program to manage personal finances Quicken is for you. I have found it very useful for keeping track of my checking and savings accounts. You can also make automatic posts to your accounts. Which is nice feature if you use automatic online bill pay with your bank. The program makes charts, graphs and reports showing where your money is going and coming from. It also does a nice job showing you if where you are meeting your budget and where you are spending too much money. Quicken makes keeps track of loans easy. It calculates how much money is going to interest and principle. I have been having a hard time and have been unsuccessful at setting up the program to track my 403B account. Overall, I think Quicken is a good program and recommend it to anyone to anyone who does not have a similar product already

I have used Quicken for over 12 years.  Whenever I got a new version, it always worked for me.  But, it has too many things on it that I don't need. I like to keep it more simple for me, so I just use the register, reconcile, reports, and lists-catagories. For all I use it for, I am happy with it

I already owned BOA 615,000 as well as the 2 - 50,000 Photo Objects collections. BOA 1 Million was a great addition to this collection. The search engine is fast and locates the other catalogs. I placed all the CD's on a data drive so that there is no CD swapping needed.

Not sure how product support or future plans are going to be. I haven't needed any yet. Hemera seems to have sold these products to Encore USA. Some of their links do not work but support is found at [...]

It you need to locate graphics to use in presentations then this is an excellent product. I am pleased with it

Photoshop is incredibly awesome!!!  And in reality most professionals already know that fact and have no need to read further about the program, it is a must have for them. However the learning curve here is extremely steep.  This program is designed for people that use it in their jobs daily to produce images for sale.  There are less inexpensive and easier to use programs out there for people looking to edit images for personal use including Photoshop elements.

I won't include my website URL here, but I'm a professional photographer, who displays and sells his work at juried exhibitions. I've been using Photoshop since version 5.0, roughly 6-7 years.

Frankly, I'm surprised to see how many negative reviews there are here of Photoshop CS2, and that overall the product only gets three stars. I understand all the frustration, though. Even on a top-of-the-line machine, "PS CS2" can be slow at times. However, in my case, that's because I'm working on incredibly large files. 

For example, my camera / scanner combination typically produces 50 megapixel images. By the time multiple layers are added in PS, one image file can be 500 MB - 1 GB in size. This is exactly why I have a dual-Opteron system with 4 GB of RAM: so I can work on these monster files in Photoshop!

For me, Photoshop is a must-have. There are *no* alternative programs for me to consider that can handle my files and do what I want to get done. I don't even want to mention all the advanced features that I use on a daily basis, frankly because that's part of my edge as a professional. I've spent over five years working in PS everyday, and have carefully studied several advanced books on PS. The learning curve is long, but the rewards are great if you have high goals and high standards.

Yeah, Adobe's got some major improvements to make, along the lines that other reviewers have mentioned. For me, the only real problem is poor and often wasteful use of system memory. And I would agree with other reviewers here that for most people, the full Photoshop CS2 is probably a waste of money. Photoshop Elements is probably a better way to go, though I haven't used it personally. I know a good web designer who uses Paint Shop Pro, and who seems to be happy.

IMHO, some people are probably drawn to Photoshop the way others are drawn to AutoCad or Solidworks or 3D Studio Max. All these programs are incredibly powerful tools that can support an entire career if one puts in the time and effort to become a true expert user. You can't make a career out of PS Elements, or Paint Shop Pro, or GIMP, or whatever else other reviewers may mention. PS CS2 is "the standard" for image manipulation

I have Fireworks, Corel Paint, and now CS2 to choose from. Perhaps it's my familiarity with PhotoShop that makes me so partial to it, but I feel it's the best imagery software on the market. I upgraded to this from PS7, so I missed out on CS, but from what I can tell, this is the smoothest-running version yet. I've not encountered any problems with system or support... I guess everyone's experience is different. But this is great software, and the Vanishing Point feature is just brilliant

I didn't encounter any problems with this product infact it was much easier to use and it allows you to combine and orginaze text files, chart spreadsheets, drawings, PDF documents and more into a single compressed package with advanced security features it also has many tools, overall this product was fantastic and I cannot recommend this highly enough. The interface and toolbars might be annoying but that is just a slight problem since it can be taken down and become more user friendly. The other reviewers who complained about this being slower need to know that this is just the standard edition which I use, there is a better edition which is The Professional Full Product of Adobe Acrobat 7.0 that also includes an upgrade.....

I liked how you could go underwater and try to find things. I also liked how you had to bake cookies and make sundaes. Another really cool thing was that you could buy stuff for Minette and yourself. I didn't like how the tea was so hard,though.I couldn't figure it out,but finally I got it.I liked that you had to fight Minette,too.It was funny that she had an alien tatoo on her face.Over all,Danger By Design was a fun game.

I have been playing the Nancy Drew games for a few years now, and have found that with each one the graphics, intrigue & fun just keep getting better & better.

In "Danger by Design" Nancy agrees to go to Paris to help a nervous investor of Minette's House of Fashion.  He's nervous because Minette had begun acting very strangely & had fallen way behind on her new Spring collection - both of which could lead to a failed business venture.

Once there, Nancy becomes aware of several threatening letters the designer had received, as well as a number of rumors concerning artwork that had been stolen during World War II that may be hidden in the old Wind Mill that now serves as Minette's House of Fashion.  Could they be related some how?

As Nancy Drew, you will find yourself snooping around for clues, working to earn the money needed to buy several needed items, solving various puzzles, and ultimately putting all the information together to solve the mysteries surrounding Minette & the stolen artwork.

Overall, I loved "Danger by Design".  It has the best graphics to date for an ND game & it was great fun to play.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who has enjoyed playing other such games, as well as those who enjoyed (or are enjoying) reading the ND series.

Having seen this product demonstrated at a recent photographic conference I purchased it as soon as I got home. When it arrived I immediately calibrated my PC monitor and Epson digital projector. The process is very simple with easy to follow screen prompts that walk you through the process. My images have been taken to a new level of color accuracy. 

This was the best investment I could have made to advance my photograpic color accuracy

It does the basic job well.  The calibration runs smoothly and accurately.  Hardware looks and feels solid.  My two completely different brand, size and age CRT monitors ended up with exactly the same colors sitting side by side. 
 
User interface is merely adequate.  Pop up help instructions are better than many I have seen.  You will need to know already how the calibration buttons on your monitors work (the hardwired buttons on the monitor, not software).  In order to make any edits you must run the entire time consuming calibration over.  Sometimes you can use "back" within the calibration, sometimes you must start over.  Also the separate "profile chooser" utility software, has not add or delete profile feature - even if it is a profile created and saved by the calibration software earlier.  You can see it with windows display properties, but it may not appear in the profile chooser list.

Dual monitors is the one obvious reason to choose pro over plus version.  Yes, it does dual monitors, but with an asterisk.  It will create separate profiles, but will only apply the correct profiles automatically at startup to both monitors if you have two separate video cards.  If you have a single video card with dual outputs, it will load the same profile (the last one you created) to both monitors at startup.  This quirk is documented in a readme file on the installation disk (and blames windows for the problem), but this limitation appears nowhere in advertising material, catalogs,  or on the box.  Fortunately there is a work around (not documented) at least with my particular video card and running XP.  After windows opens, you can run profile chooser then choose the correct profile for each monitor.  You may have to use windows display properties settings to specify default profile and rerun the calibration to get the profiles you want to appear in profile chooser and to select the correct profile as default. 

Once it's all set up, running profile chooser is a four of five click procedure, but you must rememeber to check it before using any application that uses color profiles.  And check it after you open the application.  I've had them change after opening photoshop - though not every time.

Not a complicated application, but it successfully repartitioned a 100G drive into 3rds on a new Lenovo laptop with XP SP2.  I would recommend using the DOS version which you can get just by booting on the CD.  Requires no install, you can simply boot, make the changes, and it is done.  Seems to be very straightforward and I would just be inherently nervous about repartitioning the boot drive with Windows running

I installed a WD 320G usb drive to use as a backup drive. I used the HD backup software to do auto backups. Unfortunatly the software took controll of the entire drive and I could not use it as you would a normal drive (Drag n drop)or access a particular file.   I used Partition Magic to reclaim my USB drive and in the process I partitioned the drive. The drive now works as I want it to I have control!

Partition Magic was very easy to use and didi a perfect job.

Even if one could afford the full PhotoShop CS or CS2, Elements has it all for the photo enthusiast.  Elements has an uncluttered interface with two choices for photo manipulation;
Quick Fix and Standard Edit. The Browser is adequate though I've used simpler ones for organizing and finding photos. Many of the features of the full program can be found in Elements like Layers, plug-ins for effects, and a variety of adjustmens.  With a little patience and experimenting, as well as magazines that include video tutorials for specific needs you'll be surprised how creative you can be. This program does not have the learning curve of the full PhotoShop software yet is more than powerful enough for the creative amateur photographer

I have yet to make a card with this software, but that is by choice...I prefer photo cards, and find it's easier to make the outside of a card with my Canon photo software, and the inside with Digital Image. I love the stationery section on this, however...lots of choices of paper designs, and it's very easy to use. I just can't figure out how to make the text larger, if you can. When you're typing up your letter, it has LARGE text; when you print your letter it has SMALL text.  

Making an envelope is easy, too...it's the only easy software I have for that! Only, I have to go to my Control Panel to click in my Canon printer properties to change the paper type to envelope.  The Hallmark software doesn't allow this--at least not the envelopes that directly follow stationery printing, although it allows it when printing your letter.  If I don't change the Canon to envelope, I'm left with ink tracks on my envelopes. (There is a separate envelope category, however, that I haven't used.  Maybe that one brings up the printer properties.)

There are loads of fun projects in this software, and it's a very colorful software.

About installation...mine was a nightmare. Disc 1 was the only one that would download.  The other two just froze my PC.  I discovered that I was changing the discs too quick.  If I waited at least a few minutes between changing discs it installed fine. I almost gave up on it, however, but am glad I didn't

I was really surprised to read some of the other reviews about this product -- it's as we we've purchased entirely different programs. In my experience with this software, I've found it to be extremely smooth-running and user-friendly from installation to printing, and the card selection and customization is second to none. 

There have been perfect cards for every occasion to date and we've customized them countless ways -- adding and editing photos, moving text, sending ecards, you name it! Navigating within the art studio is very intuitive.

Printing cards from the sofware is very easy and the on-screen configuration works great. Unlike some of the other reviews, I haven't had the problem of having to re-configure every time I print. We set it up once and that was it. I've printed on card stock paper, which turns out gorgeous, and we've also printed the quarter-fold plain letter size which also looks great and works perfect with size A2 envelopes (this is a great printing option if you don't want to buy card stock paper!).

I've used this software on all of my computers, have recommended it to many people, and so far have not yet encountered or heard of any problems. I highly recommend it. It's a fun program, the recipients will love their customized cards, and it will save you money in the long run

How quickly people forget the pain of managing RAW images with just the operating system and a copy of Photoshop.  Thanks to Aperture (and its subsequent imitators) managing (and interacting with) huge RAW libraries becomes invisible and easy.  

I specifically like the full-screen mode, which puts the images front and center.  Likewise, the Loupe tool lets you check focus on an image without taking the focus (no pun intended) away from the photography.  And you can make changes to the images without having to convert them, then edit them, then hit Save-As everytime you have a new idea.  Aperture is completely non-destructive.  The RAW image is loaded and adjustments to it are tracked seperately (yet seamlessly) so that you never have to worry about losing your master.

There's a lot more in the app beyond these things, which is what makes it such an amazing piece of software.   Its a digital SLR's best friend

I do quite a bit of teaching, so the latest versions of Power Point and Word are very useful to me. This software does feature some significant improvements of the 2000 edition, such as better presentation formats and backgrounds for Power Point, easier inclusion of graphics, animations, etc., and the new features for Word are also nice improvements. The price for these upgrades was reasonable as well

I am pleased with the product.  I already had a trial version installed on my computer when I bought it.  All I had to do was enter the code on the box and that was all there was to it.  Very easy.  I bought it for my daughter, who is in college.  I also have a son in the fourth grade, and I know that it will be useful for him, too.  I am glad that I was able to install it on more than one computer

I followed all instructions before I attempted to do an upgrade from Windows Me to Windows XP - infact, the more I read the more I was told to do a clean upgrade.  So, I did a backup and removed programs that were not compatible and I got some instructions off the internet on how to do it and it went very smooth. I love what it gave me. Clean upgrade means a clean start - you remove everything and start with a new program

I feel Home Designer Suite 6 is a good value for the price. It obviously is not a full blown pro program, which I think many people expect, however it is a great tool for an ordinary person to do preliminary plans for new construction or remodeling. Those plans can then be provided to a architect or builder as a foundation for final planning. It is quite easy to learn the basics by merely following the tutorials in the manual, or on the provided CD

I recently purchased this program and I was able to use most of the functions without reading the instruction manual.  It practically loaded and started itself.  Overall, I am very impressed.  The only thing that I still find confusing is cabinet design and trying to do a walk-thru of the final design.  I better read the book again.  I'm a beginner and I would recomend this program for anyone who likes to play around with home design and remodeling ideas

This is a good software for casual use (hiking, biking, geocaching), but not without issues. On the positive side, it definitely beats all non-digital (scanned USGS maps) alternatives. The level of details is good enough(how many of us need to know topography down to 5 feet?). The fact that maps are digitally generated (with vectors I believe) makes all the labels clear at any scale. It has two advantages over its main "digital" competitor, NG Topo. First, all of the US is on one DVD for the price of separate state/region CDs from NG. And second, it is available. I could not even find NG's Northeast edition anywhere on the web! One might think NH and ME are some obscure corners of the globe and not big tourist destinations.

Now the few negatives. The Exchange feature with GPS is flaky. Sometimes it takes several tries of unplugging and replugging the cable and restarting the program before it recognizes my Garmin. Part of it could be that low and mid range GPS still have serial connection and are not truly plug-and-play even with COM-to-USB adapter (beats me why Garmin can't make all their GPS with USB in this day and age). In any case, regardless of whose  fault it is, it is annoying at times not to be able to connect the two smoothly.

The second problem I noticed was with the 3-D window. It clearly consumes a lot of memory and crashes my laptop if I do a lot of rapid rescaling. I ended up just closing that window, since it is pretty much for "coolness" and does not add any real topographical value.

Finally, I had a problem with Delorme's service. I purchased it from Amazon with a rebate offer. However, a month after submitting the necessary info I received a card from Delorme stating that the bar code I sent was not a UPC code. The box only had one bar code on it so I am not sure how I could have made a mistake. They requested that I send a correct one, but with the code cut out and gone, how do they expect me to come up with one?! I feel a little bit like that was a cheap way out of paying the rebate but $20 is not worth the time arguing with them over it. I would be interested to hear if anyone else experienced the same problem.

I recently bought this version of Windows XP on Amazon.com after the release of Apple's Boot Camp. I printed out the installation instructions and followed the meticulously after setting up my new Macintosh. I then installed this software, installed antivirus (and other software like Office, Publisher, Visio, SimCity), and I updated the Windows OS. Everything operates as well as on my old pc, except it runs A LOT FASTER. I have a mac with 1 gig ram, dual-core intel processor, and a mammoth harddrive (4 times bigger than my Compaq), and I can access the corporate intranet, LiveMeeting, and other apps with so much ease. When I am done, I reboot and I am back to my Mac. Give it a whirl. It is awesome

I agree, Windows could improve thier products but I'm not going to jump on the Linux bandwagon just yet.  You can get this product Academic for 84.00 on the web.  I own several copies for my home computers.  If you network and use wireless this is the program to use.  I use both Unix and Windows at work and the Unix is far more stable. Compatibility issues are what kills Unix/Linux for now and Linux is not user friendly. In the future Apple and Linux will have some of the same issues as Windows to deal with as they become more popular. Windows dominates for a reason.  Also, when you upgrade select full install and not the upgrade.  You will need a full version copy of Windows 98, Windows Me, or Windows 2000 to accomplish this. Registering your software with Microsoft is virtually painless, even if you need a new key.  You can load Windows five times before your key expires.  At that point you can call them for a new one. 
I'd buy this product again and Amazon is a great company to deal with- FIVE STARS to them!!

I'm a longtime Mac user and for re-naming and archiving and cataloguing thousands of images iView Media Pro is the best, I really like the feature that let's you produce and publish on-line galleries of your images, without any code or html experience, using only a very simpe interface and you're ready to go.

For the full-time photographer or amateur, I highly recomend it

I have been using Kodak software for years to edit my pictures.  Corel makes it easy to back pictures up and move them around.  The editing software is extremely easy to use giving three choices for each option.  There are also a lot of creative options as well.  I highly recommend this software to everyone!!

I had a much earlier version of Hallmark Card Studio and really liked it.  I think this new version (Deluxe 2006) is even better.  This program is so easy to use and yet able to create some beautiful cards.  My favorite part of the program is the Event Planner.  The reminders are wonderful.  I haven't missed a lecture, appointment, or any other time commitment since loading this program.  I love the fact that I can set reminders for days and days ahead.  Get this set for yourself and don't be afraid to get it for someone who is not too computer savvy.  It should satisfy any user.

I've tried this on two different mac computers: an emac desktop and  an ibook G4, it runs perfectly on both. I see that some people are having problems, I'll see if I can help with that at the end of the review.
I'm a huge x-men fan, but can't afford to buy a bunch of back-issues. The essential book collections are affordable, but they're printed in black & white. With this one disc you get almost 500 uncanny issues, including annuals, all are high-quality scan in's. The disc also has a nice little bio section, and comes with the neccessary adobe software. The one down-side is that you miss out on he tie-in issues, whick gets irritating mid-90's, but I'm not docking a star for that because   what you get is well worth the price, and it's clearly stated in the description that this is strictly "uncanny". 
OK, for those of you having trouble getting it to run w/ a mac here's the process:load cd, click cd image on your desktop twice. You'll get a finder window w/ various files/folders, one will have install on it, this should be the adobe software, follow the installation instructions, and move your new adobe reader to applications when finished, restart your computer. Once re-started load the cd again, open adobe reader 6.0 click the folder image in the upper left-hand corner you should have a finder-type window, go to desktop, click on x-men and choose start.pdf. You should be good to go. HT

You will not regret it! I've tried the expensive "Total Training DVDs", which are more like "Concise Training"
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
I don't know what the other reviewer is complaining about, but this program is only capable of going as far as your knowledge of the tools of the program. Quite honestly, Adobe Illustrator does not have as "steep" a learning curve as most people claim. With that, I HIGHLY recommend any beginner to get the Illustrator Visual Quickstart guide by Elaine Weinmann. (You will not regret it! I've tried the expensive "Total Training DVDs", which are more like "Concise Training") It has to be one of the BEST most thorough book to get you introduced into the program, and for about $20, is so much BETTER than what most college "intro" computer courses offer for $200-400. 

Now as for Illustrator CS2, most of the newest features have left me very satisfied with the upgrade. Especially the inclusion of "Live Trace" (eliminating the former "auto-trace" tool), with it's multiple tracing modes, makes converting bitmap images to vectors SO easy. Another feature I love is the top control palette, similar to that of Photoshop, which makes accessing options much easier.

The only decision you might be faced with is whether these new features are worth the price of the upgrade (that is, unless your a student)

One could say that this is the standard by which all other project management software is measured ... but there are no others that compare. For better or for worse, Microsoft dominates this software segment like no other. 

However, instead of resting on its market share, MS keeps improving its product. In more than 5 years as a professional project manager at a Fortune 500 company, I have never seen another software product in daily use other than Project ... although I'm sure they are out there somewhere. 

If you require others to share your files and for your project plans to be backwardly compatible years into the future, you really shouldn't consider anything else. But don't be dismayed, this is well-designed software that is surprisingly easy to learn, use and an immediate, out-of-the-box time-saver. 

The bottom line is still incredible value, even more so if you qualify for the low-price Academic Version, as I did while taking a continuing ed project management course

After removing Symantec and installing Zonealarm my computer speeded up by a factor of at least 10. 

I'm not certain why Symantec slows some computers down but leaves others going fast -
in my case it insisted on scanning every program transferred and used and on scanning every outgoing email even though I truned those features off.

I recommend Zonealarm for users with some expertise - during the initial usage you need to understand what programs to allow and what to block (look them up on Google)

Any e-dictionary will give you definitions of course, but what I especially like about this one is that it is lightning fast. Also, when a definition contains an illustration it's indicated by an icon which you double click to view (and which comes up instanteously in a seperate window). This dictionary also allows you to search a word by different criteria other than for just its definitions: rhymes with, Homophones are, Date of, Author quoted, Definition contains...etc, etc. One note on installation: make sure you temporarily disable active virus software (and it wouldn't hurt to do the same for those other programs on the right side of the task bar)

Given that this is a stripped down version of some of Sonic Foundry's more powerful (and expensive) professional tools, Acid Music 3.0 is still a pleasant surprise.  I had it set up on my computer within ten minutes, and with very little tutoring from the instruction guide, was able to browse to the music loop library, "paint" out loops on the multi-track display, modify loop characteristics like reverb and bass, and so forth.  Obviously, Acid Music 3.0 doesn't easily stand alone.  This software cannot generate its own unique loops, so I wound up having to find a MIDI program that would let me create original loops for making truly original music.  But as a non-musician who hosts a radio program and is a bona fide electronic music fan, Acid Music 3.0 made it super easy to assemble my MIDI tracks into pretty good sounding pieces.  I would recommend this program to anyone, musician or non-musician, interested in breaking into the world of digital computer music creation.  It's been almost three months since my wife gave me my copy as a gift, and I've managed to put together many different kinds of pieces of music, using both original content and the great loops that come with the program.  It's a lot of fun, and has me hungering to see what more I can do with the thing

This one is definately the best out of all of the previous ACID Music programs.  It has a ton of loops, a really cool looking skin, and much more options than in ACID 1.0 or 2.0.  It comes with two CDs.  One of them has the application on it with some loops and the other CD has nothing but loops and demo songs!  It has over 1,600 unique loops!  Definately a good buy for those who really liked any of the previous ACID Musics

This product, as well as other software developed by Sonic Foundry, is used in the gaming industry.  It was even used to make the music in Summoner!  I've been using this product for a while, and I have made tunes like THAT and saving them as MP3s, WAVs, and so forth.  Heck, if I make a digital home video or something, I can rig it with music by adding the music in with ACID Music!  Get this if you want to make games with tunes, show off to friends and make them say &quot;Damn!  You couldn't have made this!&quot;, or if you got other reasons to make some good music without needing to hire an orcastra (eat your heart out, John Williams)

This is a good package for backing up your PC.  Fairly intuitive, although it took me a couple tries to figure out what the software was doing so I could select the right stuff to backup.  It uses good compression to minimize the amount of disk for your backup.  The downside of that is you can't just select a file to restore, you must go through the restore process.  You can select a single file, but it takes a bit of time.  Runs automatically and unobtrusively so it won't interfere with your current work.

That's a great product. I strongly recommend without hesitation. I had saved all of my data when my laptop was stolen. Easy to use and easy to restore data. Only I had a problem with e-mail restoration. Still I am glad I have bought this product.

With individual images from a photo library costing about as much as this whole collection, it's great value. I'm a beginner in the design business, and was encouraged by Robin Williams' design books to acquire resources. Art Explosion is certainly a great way to go. The large collection of fonts was an unexpected bonus.

Only last night my son was looking for photos of fruit for a project he's working on, and Art Explosion came up with hundreds. I'm working images into various items that I write and the huge variety means I can find something to match the other elements.

I did have a problem initially with a mislabelled disk. However an email to customer support and a replacement is on the way. A better search would be nice but I'm aware of the enormous task of tagging a collection this big, with no doubt a huge increase in cost. As it is I browse it with an ordinary file browser (which I actually find easier than the inbuilt catalogues) or search with a desktop search engine. Overall it's a great product

I had access to the CD version of this product that came with the Image Library Catalog in the box. I liked using it and although there was a lot of CD disc-trading with 34 discs, it worked well for me. I could usually go to the disc I wanted on the first attempt.

Later, I wanted to add this collection to my home office and went back to the same store where the original version was bought. They had sent back all the CD editions where the image catalog was included in the box and replaced them with the DVD edition that is only 5 discs and you have to send off for the catalog for the low low price of shipping ($4.95). Whenever I go to use the DVD's, I have to wait a long time for the dics to load into memory and almost forever if I request the thumbnail versions to come up in the browser.

I would rather switch discs any day then spend my time staring at the monitor while waiting for the computer to load my information. The store involved is happy because they are using less box space on the shelf (or so the stock personnel said). I am unhappy at having to send off for the manual that says it's included on the box but isn't, the extra money for the shipping, and the awkwardness to use this 'upgraded' product

   I am so pleased with this purchase!! Under normal circumstances if I spend anything over $1.00 I get caught in a spiral of buyers regret. This is a feeling that I have grown accustomed to. When I received the 800,000 through the mail I shredded open the box and started skimming through what new images I could play with. I was astonished!      
   Then, I realized something.....or rather a lack of something. I felt no remorse for buying this! I finally had a collection of clip art that could provide an abundant amount of images for collages, labels, calendars, scrapbooks, and everything else I wanted to do.

For many who like writing HTML/XHTML code, Homesite holds a special place in the heart.  It just feels so right and is addictive.

The tool can be extended, and the extensions use script which makes the development cycle dead easy.

Support from MacroMedia has not been good.  Now Adobe is in the process of buying Macromodia (as on 2005-04-19) so who knows where it all goes.  Saying that people who like this product still like it and prefer it.  If it fits you don't need support.  You just run it day after day and it works great.

(There are alternatives emerging after all these years but none quite do it yet.  CSE and TopStyle are two that are coming along.)

For some it almost seems perfect, for WYSIWYG oriented people, it might be best not to even look at it

This is by far my favourite HER Interactive Nancy Drew PC game, and I have played them all multiple times. I loved the food aspect of it [my sister's a chef], in the cafe where you could gyp the game into letting Nancy have a muffin or a bowl of delicious New England clam chowder anytime you wanted to making a sandwich for Katie; AND calling Bess and George to hear how Bess is learning to cook from a TV show and hearing her worry about what she's making.

The puzzles were not nearly as difficult as some more recent games make them; they were challenging but doable, took some moving about and kept the game adventurous. The bike riding was inventive, rather than a train or car or what have you, and I loved being down by the lighthouse, near the water.

I believe it is one of HER Interactive's best games so far and is the best bet for a Nancy Drew gamer

This is an easy product to use.  It saves you when a disk drive fills up and you want to use the same partiction but need more space.  It will grab it from another hard drive.  It is also useful in setting up a D: drive for Documents, and and E: drive for programs.  It is useful to have windows on C: alone.  There are fewer crashes.

I concur with the review that points up the problems with Adobe's new "license manager" method of activation. When you pay as much as you do for this app, or the entire suite, you should not be faced with complete lockup should you have hardware problems, or can't connect to the Internet from "location shooting." I took one star off for this egregious marketing tactic.

That said, this version of Photoshop is superb, an otherwise 5-star app. If you take the time to use the tutorials included in the help (used to be separate folders, with chapters 1 - 4 of the Classroom In A Book, but no more alas), or get one of Deke McClelland's fine tomes and do all the lessons, there is nothing in this app that the novice can't start to use from Day One. With today's point & shoot cameras packing more resolution, and more manual control, into their functions, use of Photoshop becomes more than just a hobby. You can really "rescue" photos that are too dark, too bright, exceedingly color-shifted, from the "cut" folder and still make prints. Further, the Camera RAW functionality allows anyone with a sufficiently functional digicam to touch up snapshots into fine photography.

A warning: you need the fastest processor you can afford (a Core Duo or Quatro will be superb), and as much RAM as your system can take. There is an optional performance plug-in which maximizes performance on systems with more than 1 Gigabyte of RAM. You need AT LEAST that much under Windows XP to get good performance out of PS CS2. If you can use 2GB or more dual-channel memory, that's even better (the dual-channel RAM adds a small boost when handling large file sizes, e.g. Camera RAW image sources). If you don't have these, don't expect Photoshop to act fast. 

Adobe Bridge is a major improvement for this version. It offers superior file and image management functions, and can even do batch editing on images. You can even perform Camera RAW adjustments right from Bridge. Bridge can perform batch processes WHILE YOU EDIT IN PHOTOSHOP. If that isn't cool, I don't know what is. If you doubt me, check out Deke McClelland's PHOTOSHOP CS2 ONE-ON-ONE tutorial for his chapter on using Adobe Bridge. His video introduction (included on a DVD in the book), and chapter on using and customizing Bridge, are terrific introductions.

If you're a user of versions 5.x (as I was), 6, or 7, upgrading to CS2 is a no-brainer. Don't wait. Get it now before the Adobe License Manager gets worse in 2007

It has some nice upgrades from version 6.  It is quicker than the previous version. Highlighting text is a bit easier.   It caused a few problems with my officejet 5510xi and its ports, but I found a patch for the officejet and all is well.  It is a product that is helpful in my work

I upgraded from Version 5. I don't use very many of the features. But the big difference I see is, files sizes seem to be greatly reduced. Something I would scan and be 10mb, now might be 2mb. This is just opinion, nothing scientific. The interface takes some getting used to, a bit different. Overall for the price ($99 - Less $20 Rebate), a great deal

I find that the new version 7 of Adobe Acrobat loads faster than version 5, both stand-alone and within my internet browser.  Also, the new version is better integrated with the browser and with Microsoft Office.  I believe Adobe heard and responded to the complaints about version 6.  There are many other features which I have yet to try but certainly look worthwhile.  Kudos for what I see as a substantial improvement.  I recommend

I have yet to make a card with this software, but that is by choice...I prefer photo cards, and find it's easier to make the outside of a card with my Canon photo software, and the inside with Digital Image. I love the stationery section on this, however...lots of choices of paper designs, and it's very easy to use. I just can't figure out how to make the text larger, if you can. When you're typing up your letter, it has LARGE text; when you print your letter it has SMALL text.  

Making an envelope is easy, too...it's the only easy software I have for that! Only, I have to go to my Control Panel to click in my Canon printer properties to change the paper type to envelope.  The Hallmark software doesn't allow this--at least not the envelopes that directly follow stationery printing, although it allows it when printing your letter.  If I don't change the Canon to envelope, I'm left with ink tracks on my envelopes. (There is a separate envelope category, however, that I haven't used.  Maybe that one brings up the printer properties.)

There are loads of fun projects in this software, and it's a very colorful software.

About installation...mine was a nightmare. Disc 1 was the only one that would download.  The other two just froze my PC.  I discovered that I was changing the discs too quick.  If I waited at least a few minutes between changing discs it installed fine. I almost gave up on it, however, but am glad I didn't

Check your printer drivers and spooler.  I'm as close to a computer guru as you'd want having
played with computers in general and PC's in particular since the heady early days of Sinclair,
Kildall, and Adam Osborne.  Installed Hallmark Card Studio on my beloved's machine several
years back.  Was immediately impressed with how thoughtfully programed for the beginner - my
lady took to it immediately - and yet how full featured it was for an advanced user (only wish
could import export data to other address books, and wouldn't it be great to have a Palm
conduit?!-)(I digress!-).
Every new version just gets better to the point 2004 has close to two gigs of cards and imagery.
In short, Sandra Hallmark Card Studio 2004 IS A KEEPER.

Now, approve of your using 98SE, I recommend to my students (yes I teach computing) not to go
beyond 98SE and certainly not to connect anything from MS to the InterNet beyond 98SE (little
thing code name of Palladium!-(
There can be problems with corrupting printer drivers and notably spool32.  Try removing your
printer under START &#62;SETTINGS &#62;PRINTERS, restart your computer with the printer on and
reinstall.  Hope this helps and you learn to enjoy this little gem of a program.  HB

How quickly people forget the pain of managing RAW images with just the operating system and a copy of Photoshop.  Thanks to Aperture (and its subsequent imitators) managing (and interacting with) huge RAW libraries becomes invisible and easy.  

I specifically like the full-screen mode, which puts the images front and center.  Likewise, the Loupe tool lets you check focus on an image without taking the focus (no pun intended) away from the photography.  And you can make changes to the images without having to convert them, then edit them, then hit Save-As everytime you have a new idea.  Aperture is completely non-destructive.  The RAW image is loaded and adjustments to it are tracked seperately (yet seamlessly) so that you never have to worry about losing your master.

There's a lot more in the app beyond these things, which is what makes it such an amazing piece of software.   Its a digital SLR's best friend

I do quite a bit of teaching, so the latest versions of Power Point and Word are very useful to me. This software does feature some significant improvements of the 2000 edition, such as better presentation formats and backgrounds for Power Point, easier inclusion of graphics, animations, etc., and the new features for Word are also nice improvements. The price for these upgrades was reasonable as well

I am pleased with the product.  I already had a trial version installed on my computer when I bought it.  All I had to do was enter the code on the box and that was all there was to it.  Very easy.  I bought it for my daughter, who is in college.  I also have a son in the fourth grade, and I know that it will be useful for him, too.  I am glad that I was able to install it on more than one computer

I have been running Windows XP SP2 and would "never" want to go back to Windows ME or Windows 98. With the XP, I rarely need to re-boot my system, and my PC no longer freezes up. There is a built-in Windows Firewall plus a pop-up blocker which are both awesome. The system is much safer, and I have NEVER had a virus, worm, or trojan horse while running the Windows XP Home with a good internet security/virus program.

One thing: Make sure you have at least 256 mb of space available in your PC before starting to download, as this does require at least that.

Get it! You won't be disappointed

Simple. It loads like a blaze. Sure all the new frills and features like easy annotations are neat, but the speed of 7.0 alone makes it worth every dime. Especially if your current Acrobat is the half-baked clunky 6.0.x that burst through the gates before it had legs.

Some other people have complain about the quality, if you're a print graphic artist then its problem.  As a web designer who need 2" by 2" graphics, this set is great.  You do get a variety of photos of objects.  For example, there's like 20 different examples of a live garnade, something like several hundred coins from different countries.  For $17 this is definitely worth the money.

I've found it is best to export the image to a graphic editor.  Then from there, make it transparent, resize it, and compress it to your wishes.  There's a fair amount of "People" graphic, but not as much as I'd like.  I don't have the 100K collection so don't know if there's any image overlapse between this and that collection.

Quality is pretty nice for small prints and great for web.  Especially superb for smaller projects like christmas cards and so forth, but not good if you want to print high resolution photographs on large paper.

For $17 this is the best collection I've ever bought, Photo Objects II is still in shipping, so can't compare quality with that collection yet.

I already owned BOA 615,000 as well as the 2 - 50,000 Photo Objects collections. BOA 1 Million was a great addition to this collection. The search engine is fast and locates the other catalogs. I placed all the CD's on a data drive so that there is no CD swapping needed.

Not sure how product support or future plans are going to be. I haven't needed any yet. Hemera seems to have sold these products to Encore USA. Some of their links do not work but support is found at [...]

It you need to locate graphics to use in presentations then this is an excellent product. I am pleased with it

If you're one of those people like me, who hang on to an older version of the application waiting for the right time, now is the time to upgrade.  You won't be disappointed.  Just ask the editors of both PC Magazine and C|Net which awarded this version their Editor's Choice Award.

Once again Adobe has listened to its loyal customer base.  The proof is in the new version of Illustrator.  Many of our requests were answered with the latest version including some that we didn't even think of.  I was happy to find out that even with the new features, Adobe has not altered Illustrator's previous palettes or keyboard commands.  There's nothing worse than having a shortcut or command memorized for years and then it gets changed with a new version.  No fear here!

First of all, I want to say that I am really impressed with the Live Trace and Live Paint features, especially when used together.   We all know that sometimes ideas hit us when we least expect it and are away from our beloved computer.  We end up drawing it out on a napkin, paper towel or the unused envelope from our glove compartment.  Normally, once you get back to your computer you have to try to redraw your graphic using Illustrator which takes both time and effort---not any more.

Take your napkin masterpiece to your scanner and scan it in.  Once the image has been scanned, then the fun begins.  Once the image has been scanned in and brought into Illustrator CS2, use the Live Trace feature to actually trace your drawing.  This feature actually turns to drawing into a Live Trace object for easy manipulation.  After applying some blurring as needed, your traced image is cleared up.  Then, convert your Live Trace object into a Live Paint object using the new Control Palette.  I like the Live Paint tool also because it reminds me of working in Photoshop.

Once you've converted to the Live Paint object, you can easily use the pen and other tools to modify any points to your liking.  Live Paint also has a feature called Gap Detector which can prevents paint from going over into other sections because of a break in a line.  This is a handy feature that keeps you from having to fix overspill later.  When the object outlines are finalized, use the Live Paint feature to easily fill any region with color.  Voila!  You are done.  Go from napkin to art in a matter of minutes.

A concern of many of us for years was the fact that while Illustrator keep getting better and newer features, it also mean more and more palettes.  Sometimes it became a little unmanageable.  However, the pros at Adobe recognized this problem and applied a solution - the Control palette.  This new palette sits at the top of the screen.  First, it acts as a an object inspector providing information.  Secondly, (and more importantly), the Control palette provides easy access to fill and stroke dropdown menus, brush shape, opacity, and style.  No longer do you have to fumble through your palette to get at these frequently used features.  If you are fans of Adobe's other Creative Suite 2 software, you will be pleased to learn that the Control Palette is apart of their new makeover too.

Here are some more new additions and changes to Illustrator:

*	Like Photoshop, Illustrator CS2 now supports custom workspaces.  You can display only the palettes you need at any time. You are also able to access or save any workspace at any time or use workspace templates.
*	Adobe has improved the Swatch and color integration.  Now, working with the other Creative Suite 2 programs is seamless.
*	Isolation Mode is a feature that allows you to double-click a group move and edit internal objects without having to search through the Layers Palette.
*	CS2 now supports all of the latest Wacom tablets. It now provides brush support for the new Wacom 6D Art Pen and adds a new dimension Illustrator's Calligraphic and Scatter brushes
*	Adobe Bridge integration is now a part of Illustrator CS2.  Bridge allows you to easily manage images through thumbnails for better workflow.
*	Macromedia Flash exports are now available.  You can export both text and objects as Flash files which result in smaller file size and easier incorporation into web projects.
*	You can now open Photoshop files with layer comps within Illustrator.  This new feature allows you to view many versions of a layout at one time, just as you do in Photoshop
*	Custom stroke placement is a new addition to Illustrator. You can now place strokes on the outside, inside or center of a path.
*	Underline and Strikethrough are two of over 170 new type enhancements.
*	These are a few of the new features!

The $169 upgrade cost is well worth the money, just for the Live Trace and Live Paint features alone.  However, you get so much more in the new Illustrator CS2.  Upgrade now and be completely satisfied.  If you haven't purchased a vector graphics program, get Illustrator, especially if you are already an owner of a version of Photoshop.  This new version of Illustrator even looks more like the familiar Photoshop layout.

I recently purchased this program and I was able to use most of the functions without reading the instruction manual.  It practically loaded and started itself.  Overall, I am very impressed.  The only thing that I still find confusing is cabinet design and trying to do a walk-thru of the final design.  I better read the book again.  I'm a beginner and I would recomend this program for anyone who likes to play around with home design and remodeling ideas

Great SW, easy to learn, and good graphics.  Really helps visualize the space when you can see it 3D. 

Could be improved if numerous similar objects could be selected and changed simultaneously (e.g., windows, doors, cabinets to get all with the same materials, colors, & hardware rather than one at a time - very labor intensive).  Should warn users to select/create a style and then copy/paste them where needed.

Also, difficult (maybe impossible, because I haven't figured out how to do it) to change a room's/house's overall style once you start a given design

I recently bought this version of Windows XP on Amazon.com after the release of Apple's Boot Camp. I printed out the installation instructions and followed the meticulously after setting up my new Macintosh. I then installed this software, installed antivirus (and other software like Office, Publisher, Visio, SimCity), and I updated the Windows OS. Everything operates as well as on my old pc, except it runs A LOT FASTER. I have a mac with 1 gig ram, dual-core intel processor, and a mammoth harddrive (4 times bigger than my Compaq), and I can access the corporate intranet, LiveMeeting, and other apps with so much ease. When I am done, I reboot and I am back to my Mac. Give it a whirl. It is awesome

I agree, Windows could improve thier products but I'm not going to jump on the Linux bandwagon just yet.  You can get this product Academic for 84.00 on the web.  I own several copies for my home computers.  If you network and use wireless this is the program to use.  I use both Unix and Windows at work and the Unix is far more stable. Compatibility issues are what kills Unix/Linux for now and Linux is not user friendly. In the future Apple and Linux will have some of the same issues as Windows to deal with as they become more popular. Windows dominates for a reason.  Also, when you upgrade select full install and not the upgrade.  You will need a full version copy of Windows 98, Windows Me, or Windows 2000 to accomplish this. Registering your software with Microsoft is virtually painless, even if you need a new key.  You can load Windows five times before your key expires.  At that point you can call them for a new one. 
I'd buy this product again and Amazon is a great company to deal with- FIVE STARS to them!!

I do not why the others had these problems with Windows XP. I have run this program since it came out 2001? Except for the danger of attack by viruses, I have had no trouble as long as enough RAM is installed. A minimum of 500-750 is essential. With the addition of antivirus software and service pack 2, I feel fairly secure.

I've been frustrated for quite some time now with having Adobe Reader and expecting it should do what Adobe Acrobat can do.  I was especially interested in creating PDF's (Portable Document Formats)of Word documents.  Although I have Photoshop that can do this for me in a roundabout way, I wasn't satisfied with the extra time it took to do so.  Faced with the assignment of pulling together a rather large family cookbook, aptly named, "Death by Cholesterol", I felt justified in finally purchasing not only "Acrobat" but also "OmniPage", an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software.  With these programs in hand it made the project fun to do.  Now I have the whole cookbook with its index as a sinle multi-page PDF file that can be read and also printed out by anyone I care to send it to over the Internet.  It's of great value to me now and gives me enhanced versatility even though I've only used a small part of its capabilities.  The reason that I've only given it a "4" rating?  I'm upset that I didn't get the full version, but I can't justify doing so.  I'm being petulant

I ordered the box version from Amazon, instead of the download from the manufacturer not only because it was less expensive, but the main reason was so that I would have a paper manual. So many programs don't come with hard copy manuals and I prefer them over on-line help. 

As for the program itself, I trialed a download first. For me, the thing I fell in love with was the ability to call up multiple images, side by side, and compare them! It makes selecting the best image a breeze - a HUGE timesaver. You also have the ability to swiftly zoom in to check focus at full rez. Another wonderful thing is that putting the curser over one of the preview images, and sliding it, will slide all the open previews simultaneously, so you don't have to individually zoom and move each image. You can do this with up to 6 images at a time! You can also do a quick histogram check by hitting the "h" key, which makes it easy to toss off bad exposures at the same time as the review. While you've got the previews open you can hover the mouse over them and hit any # key to color-code the image. The colors can be keyed to whatever description you want. I do "1=green" for yes, "2=yellow" for maybe, and "3=red" for no. There's room for quite a few more colors after that. I then hit the sort key back in the main screen and quickly select all the red "no" images and delete them. After I have all my green "yes" images, I then review them 6 at a time to give them star ratings. I resort by rating and now all the best images are at the top of the page and I can start processing them. 

You can batch process file name, and some other things that I don't bother with, as well. It's got some nice keywording ability and you can easily sync the keywords with your Photoshop files. What's incredibly nice is that you can click on any word in the keyword list and all the images you own, with those keywords, are immediately shown in thumbnails! Finding an image is actually fun! It will even give you thumbnails of images you don't even store on your hard drive anymore! 

Fantastic program - I highly recommend it! The only reason I didn't 5 star it is b/c it's not all that intuitive. This is a read-the-manual kind of program, but you can do an awful lot with it without having to get too far in the book. ;)

I downloaded the demo of this program and although I am by no means a pro photographer I do have over 4,000 digital photographs of my family and I am taking new photos each day. In addition I post my photos on Pbase so family and friends can always see the latest photos.  I started looking into Digital Asset Management after I started to fall behind on updates of the Pbase photo website because of the time consuming process of managing my collection. In case you have not looked, there are products out there such as Idimager, Imatch, Extensis Porfolio, and many more. I downloaded demos of Imatch and Iview Media Pro and used each only briefly. Although Imatch costs only $49.00 or so and Iview costs about 3x more (around $160) I chose Iview because I felt the interface was just easier to use. Of course this says nothing about the features in each product and I am not attempting a feature by feature comparison because I don't have the time. I do think that Imatch is an excellent product and the few features I am looking for appeared to be available in both products. I recommend that anyone looking to purchase software attempt to download a demo first

I have been using Kodak software for years to edit my pictures.  Corel makes it easy to back pictures up and move them around.  The editing software is extremely easy to use giving three choices for each option.  There are also a lot of creative options as well.  I highly recommend this software to everyone!!

It took so long for this to come out...I hated the little hints they gave us hardcore NDers on the Dare to Play message board. I had extremely high hopes for this game--I adored Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon and waited AGES for this game.

Now, besides the absurd level of difficulty in this game [it was seemingly VERY hard in my eyes--I could not make it the first time through without the assistance of a walkthrough], I LOVED it. The flight to Paris and the travel about the city--it was also a LOT easier to make money in this game than in Secret of the Old Clock.

I did not like how hard the puzzles were, but all in all it was an amazing game. There was a lot of talking, and that can really slow down gameplay and frustrate a gamer. And puzzles like the darkroom, the paintbomb and the cookies were absurdly difficult. But otherwise it was worth it

These are a favorite in the home. Even though we have all of them, they   are each different and provide hours of entertainment. Skills are learned while solving puzzles some include spatial manipulation of puzzle pieces and roman numerals. Great source of fun and learning. Also a desire to read the actual book and see what is different and the same between book and game

I had a very old version of Hallmark Studio, don't even remember how old.  Wanted to update.  I installed the program and was absolutely amazed and very happy with this product and features.  Lots of cards to choose from, very very pretty colors. The event planner is great too! The ONLY thing I would change is the ability change font in the planner, and move written info by tabbing.  Otherwise it's a wonderful program.  Highly recommended!!

I had a much earlier version of Hallmark Card Studio and really liked it.  I think this new version (Deluxe 2006) is even better.  This program is so easy to use and yet able to create some beautiful cards.  My favorite part of the program is the Event Planner.  The reminders are wonderful.  I haven't missed a lecture, appointment, or any other time commitment since loading this program.  I love the fact that I can set reminders for days and days ahead.  Get this set for yourself and don't be afraid to get it for someone who is not too computer savvy.  It should satisfy any user.

I'm not a Spider-Man fan.  I love POWERS, THE ULTIMATES, SUPREME POWER, PLANETARY and other stuff by Warren Ellis, Brian Michael Bendis, et.al.  So when I bought this, I wondered if spending a whopping $49 would be worth it.    

I wanted to read Straczynski's recent run of Spider-Man, but if I was going to spend about $20 on a graphic novel, why not spend a little more for the whole thing.  And that's just what you get.  In addition to getting Straczynski's 4-year run (which includes Spider-Man's evolution and discovery of his totemic powers), you get everything leading up to JUNE 2006 (which is just like 3 issues ago!).  And all on 1 DVD-ROM.  

True, the Cons are that when it comes to Crossovers, you only get the Amazing Spider-Man stories and reading it off your computer isn't as fun as reading the actual comics -- but that doesn't compare to getting the entire run.  It's like complaining about getting a free PS3, XBox360 AND Nintendo Wii, because the box didn't come with it or you're missing one controller.  

$50 may seem steep, but if comics cost $3 now, so for the price of like one or two months worth of comics -- or for 2 books, you get everything.  And it's true, you can just print out the pages if you want (so if you want to abuse your office or school's printer, go for it!

This set has got everything.  Almost every major Spider-man moment is in this collection.  From Spider-man's first appearance in Amazing Fantasy #15, his wedding, and not to forget those great super-villain battles with the Green Goblin and Venom.

Each issue is scanned in .pdf format.  It has all the original colors, ads, and fan mail printed.  They are all organized by year and it says they are all printable.  If you are looking for the entire Stan Lee and John Romita Sr.'s run, here it is.  It is great to see where Todd Mcfarlane, the creator of Spawn got his start on old webhead.   J. Michael Strackzynski, the writer of Babylon 5 also takes a crack at Spider-man's life.  

The collection covers the beginning from Amazing Fantasy #15 to Amazing Spiderman #531, which is around the start of Marvel's Civil War.

Instead of spending thousands of dollars on purchasing back issues, you can own this entire collection for around $40-$45.  If you have the ink, you can print out any issue to your heart's desire.

The only drawbacks are around the 80s when several spider-man books begin to crossover.  You only get a part of the story in Kraven's Last Hunt or Maximum Carnage.  One major moment of Spider-man's life is left out, where he fights Harry Osborn as Green Goblin. The conclusion of that story took place in The Spectacular Spider-man title.  That problem is going to fixed in the future as GIT Corp. has plans to release a complementary collection  dvd that includes The Spectacular Spider-man, Web of Spiderman, and Peter Parker:  Spider-man.  They say on the boards that it will be out by fall of next year, but you never know with this company.  I waited about six months for this dvd after it was delayed from its original release date from march.

Now that I have it, I cannot wait to dig into the mythos of the old webhead.  I recommend this to anyone who loves comics and loves Spider-man.

Be sure to look out for the Ultimate Spider-man collection and there are a few others like the Hulk, Daredevil, Iron Man, and Captain America collections that are due out next year

My dad got this for me to supplement a Latin textbook I have been studying for my high school language course. It is quick and easily understandable. You get plenty of words and phrases, which is perfect for a traveler. If you want to learn the language for the sake of knowing it, not travel, however, you'd better get a book to supplement this. It doesn't teach about pluralization, verb conjugation, or other oddities that the language holds, such as, in Latin, the ending -m which implies a direct object. The Latin CD also does not use the dashes over the vowels, which may or may not be necessary, I don't know. Overall, I am very happy with the product and with the price of $39.99 (USD), but I am also quite glad I have my textbook (ECCE ROMANI) to go with it

I loved the X-Men cartoon in the 90s and Fox, and always liked reading the graphic novels in Barnes and Noble and the like.  However, I just never had the time or money to get into it like I wanted.  This collection is a great way for us beginnings to understand the depth of the mythology and see the transformation of the series over the years.  Reading the first 60 issues was a trip -- seeing how the characters were developed, both the art and their literary personality.  

If you're interested in the X-Men, whether from the new movies or just from being a kid at heart -- for 40 bucks you can know it all. (almost)

While I love the content and the overall idea, it seems they seriously skimped on the packaging. All you get, outside of the outer box, is a cd in a paper envelope. No jewel case, book, insert, etc.......perhaps it's on the cd

You will not regret it! I've tried the expensive "Total Training DVDs", which are more like "Concise Training"
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
I don't know what the other reviewer is complaining about, but this program is only capable of going as far as your knowledge of the tools of the program. Quite honestly, Adobe Illustrator does not have as "steep" a learning curve as most people claim. With that, I HIGHLY recommend any beginner to get the Illustrator Visual Quickstart guide by Elaine Weinmann. (You will not regret it! I've tried the expensive "Total Training DVDs", which are more like "Concise Training") It has to be one of the BEST most thorough book to get you introduced into the program, and for about $20, is so much BETTER than what most college "intro" computer courses offer for $200-400. 

Now as for Illustrator CS2, most of the newest features have left me very satisfied with the upgrade. Especially the inclusion of "Live Trace" (eliminating the former "auto-trace" tool), with it's multiple tracing modes, makes converting bitmap images to vectors SO easy. Another feature I love is the top control palette, similar to that of Photoshop, which makes accessing options much easier.

The only decision you might be faced with is whether these new features are worth the price of the upgrade (that is, unless your a student)

One could say that this is the standard by which all other project management software is measured ... but there are no others that compare. For better or for worse, Microsoft dominates this software segment like no other. 

However, instead of resting on its market share, MS keeps improving its product. In more than 5 years as a professional project manager at a Fortune 500 company, I have never seen another software product in daily use other than Project ... although I'm sure they are out there somewhere. 

If you require others to share your files and for your project plans to be backwardly compatible years into the future, you really shouldn't consider anything else. But don't be dismayed, this is well-designed software that is surprisingly easy to learn, use and an immediate, out-of-the-box time-saver. 

The bottom line is still incredible value, even more so if you qualify for the low-price Academic Version, as I did while taking a continuing ed project management course

After removing Symantec and installing Zonealarm my computer speeded up by a factor of at least 10. 

I'm not certain why Symantec slows some computers down but leaves others going fast -
in my case it insisted on scanning every program transferred and used and on scanning every outgoing email even though I truned those features off.

I recommend Zonealarm for users with some expertise - during the initial usage you need to understand what programs to allow and what to block (look them up on Google)

I've been using Studio for years and while I definitely had reliability problems with Studio 10.0, 10.6 has been very reliable, and beta testing 10.7 shows me it is just getting better.  I tried Premiere Elements but it was much harder to figure out how to do things, and it was much slower burning a simple DVD image, and it simply doesn't do HD which I've started playing with.  I'm sticking with Studio and I make a DVD just about every week with my kids' videos.  I do recommend that you have a good system that is fairly clean

Having seen this product demonstrated at a recent photographic conference I purchased it as soon as I got home. When it arrived I immediately calibrated my PC monitor and Epson digital projector. The process is very simple with easy to follow screen prompts that walk you through the process. My images have been taken to a new level of color accuracy. 

This was the best investment I could have made to advance my photograpic color accuracy

I bought Version 5 of this software a few years ago and was very pleased with the many features.  A tech at my Isp (BellSouth) recommended this software to me. I recently purchased version 6 for my new laptop which is running Windows Xp Pro.  Installation was a snap.  Updates are frequent and install quickly with my Dsl connection.  The software suite has in my opinion more and better features than Norton Pro which I use on my desktop.  I really like the Registry cleaner (fixer) and the defrag tools.  (They use Trend Micro for virus protection) The program allows simple maintenance or for more experienced users indepth tools that allow you to maintain and tweak your system. There is a lot of extra programs that come with this software that I did not install after reading some reviews and warnings about using them.  However, my personal experience after installing just the System Suit 6 Professional has really been good for me. I bought my copy from Walmart and filled out the rebate following the instructions carefully and I received my rebate after about 6 weeks.  I hope if anyone buys this software because of my recommendation will have similar results.  I would rate my knowledge of computers as above average, which may be why I did not have any problems with the software.

Any e-dictionary will give you definitions of course, but what I especially like about this one is that it is lightning fast. Also, when a definition contains an illustration it's indicated by an icon which you double click to view (and which comes up instanteously in a seperate window). This dictionary also allows you to search a word by different criteria other than for just its definitions: rhymes with, Homophones are, Date of, Author quoted, Definition contains...etc, etc. One note on installation: make sure you temporarily disable active virus software (and it wouldn't hurt to do the same for those other programs on the right side of the task bar)

Its a great GPS once its starts and detects the satellites (sometimes it can take up to 5 mins). I used it with iGuidance and that software is the whole world of difference. I can actually hear what the direction are saying vs the software that came with the GPS unit (robotic sounds, need to subtitle that for me PLEASE!)

Given that this is a stripped down version of some of Sonic Foundry's more powerful (and expensive) professional tools, Acid Music 3.0 is still a pleasant surprise.  I had it set up on my computer within ten minutes, and with very little tutoring from the instruction guide, was able to browse to the music loop library, "paint" out loops on the multi-track display, modify loop characteristics like reverb and bass, and so forth.  Obviously, Acid Music 3.0 doesn't easily stand alone.  This software cannot generate its own unique loops, so I wound up having to find a MIDI program that would let me create original loops for making truly original music.  But as a non-musician who hosts a radio program and is a bona fide electronic music fan, Acid Music 3.0 made it super easy to assemble my MIDI tracks into pretty good sounding pieces.  I would recommend this program to anyone, musician or non-musician, interested in breaking into the world of digital computer music creation.  It's been almost three months since my wife gave me my copy as a gift, and I've managed to put together many different kinds of pieces of music, using both original content and the great loops that come with the program.  It's a lot of fun, and has me hungering to see what more I can do with the thing

This product, as well as other software developed by Sonic Foundry, is used in the gaming industry.  It was even used to make the music in Summoner!  I've been using this product for a while, and I have made tunes like THAT and saving them as MP3s, WAVs, and so forth.  Heck, if I make a digital home video or something, I can rig it with music by adding the music in with ACID Music!  Get this if you want to make games with tunes, show off to friends and make them say &quot;Damn!  You couldn't have made this!&quot;, or if you got other reasons to make some good music without needing to hire an orcastra (eat your heart out, John Williams)

I am a veteran screen printer and am kind of new to the graphic arts side.  This purchase has paid for itself over and over now that I don't have to run to someone else for art.  It was rumored that it is hard to find what is needed as there is no computer search for images...  I guess some people are too lazy to familiarize themselves with the book of images...  I did and I LOVE this product!!!!

With individual images from a photo library costing about as much as this whole collection, it's great value. I'm a beginner in the design business, and was encouraged by Robin Williams' design books to acquire resources. Art Explosion is certainly a great way to go. The large collection of fonts was an unexpected bonus.

Only last night my son was looking for photos of fruit for a project he's working on, and Art Explosion came up with hundreds. I'm working images into various items that I write and the huge variety means I can find something to match the other elements.

I did have a problem initially with a mislabelled disk. However an email to customer support and a replacement is on the way. A better search would be nice but I'm aware of the enormous task of tagging a collection this big, with no doubt a huge increase in cost. As it is I browse it with an ordinary file browser (which I actually find easier than the inbuilt catalogues) or search with a desktop search engine. Overall it's a great product

  My experience with this software as well as the company has been extremely positive. I ordered this program a little over a month ago. When I first received it from Amazon, I was amazed at the shear size of the program. It has a HUGE 1,300 page book with all the images and categories for easy reference. It also comes with 34 CDs that are loaded with images. This software is truly the largest set of art I have ever seen!
  Dealing with Nova Development is as easy to use as their software! When I first opened the box I was a little overwhelmed with the whole thing, so I called tech support. I may have waited a whole 20 seconds before I began speaking with a technician. They walked me through the install and how to use the clip art. They were professional and courteous.
  This software gets an A+ in my book!.

I run the after school program at the local JR high where i work. We try to push the importance of computer skills on the children. I just upgraded to the 800,000 clip art library. We use these images for just about every project. I have never wanted a certain type of image and not been able to find it!!!

I was an avid reader of Nancy Drew mysteries as a girl during the 50s and now as an old girl I get to revisit Nancy in another form.  I enjoyed the game, was happy not to have to deal with an alarm clock this time.  Just go up the stairs in the cabin a few clicks and you have the option to make it AM or PM.  I got hopelessly lost in the forest in the beginning and the night sounds were spookily effective.  I will admit I did resort to an outside tip after I put the sparkplugs in the wrong way in the outboard motor.  Fatal error!  It made me laugh, though.  Love those second chances.  This is the fourth Nancy Drew game I've played and I don't plan on stopping.  The games are well put together and not just for kids.  I find the puzzles to be challenging and the graphics and audio very well done.  Keep 'em coming herinteractive

AutoRoute Europe, not surprisingly, is very similar to Microsoft Streets and Trips.  It is easy to use, the maps are very legible, and it has many convenient features such as distance measuring and route marking (highlighting), trip planner, etc. It seems to lack some of the detail of Streets and Trips.  For example, it could not find Via Martinuzzo in Reggello, Italy.  I believe the street appears on the map, but is unnamed. However, this is minor.  Most of what you would be looking for is available and easily found.  (I had no problems finding streets in Germany, even in small towns like Wittingen.)  All in all, a very good product

Recently we are traveling a lot to London and surrounding areas on business and this map program is helping us find details quickly about areas we want to visit, travel to, and eat at.

So far the only functionality that doesn't appear in AutoRoute that does in Streets and Trips that we would like to have seen is the ability to use the mouse to draw a box around and area and then enlarge it.  This function is much more cumbersome in Autoroute.

So far we have enjoyed this program and are making a great use of it

I've had several other digital editing programs and for the price, this is the best I've ever used.  It's user-friendly with lots of special creative processes available.  I especially love to cut and paste several pics into one by using the transparency feature to seamlessly meld them into a montage.  As with any other program, practice and experimentation makes perfect!  Don't be afraid to experiment on COPIES of your pics... never the originals!

I do agree with the reviewer that said the red-eye needs improvement.  It's just barely "OK" on most red-eyes, but is lousy correcting "glowing alien eyes!"

When I bought this edition with the library feature, I wasn't sure I would use it since I had others which I thought were good.  Wrong!  It is fantastic!  I'm sorry didn't buy it sooner.

Overall, it's a 5-star product, but because of the red-eye/alien eye problem, I'm ranking it 4-stars.  Even with that, I highly recommend it

Product is terrific. Just what I was told it was. It is missing a few good tools though-such as not having the original image side by side with the image you are editing (so you can see the effect you are producing next to the original)

I ran across an internet review of HCS 2007.  The reviewer said that the rights had been sold in 2006 and that the new owners had pretty much trashed the user interface.  I don't KNOW that for sure, but what I DO know is that the 2006 version is great, like that reviewer said it was.   The interface is well organized, intuitive, clear, and just plain designed with common sense.  I was printing a nice card in less than 3 minutes - no lie.... AND it runs ENTIRELY on your hard drive - no CD required.  That alone easily recommends it

Premiere Elements has almost the same features than its "big brother" Adobe Premiere but the price is much more affordable. 

It is an excellent tool for amateurs and yet professionals.

I bought Premiere after I discovered that the software that came with my new DVD Palmcorder didn't let me edit on my PC.  Somewhere I ascertained that Premiere did permit this, and indeed it does.

I found it very easy to use, so much so that I was able to get my first two "productions" up on YouTube in a matter of perhaps two hours.  Obviously I have not learned everything this product has to offer, nor do I use very well what I have already discovered, but it was easy to get results that, for a rank beginner, actually look sort of polished.

This product would get five stars from me if it accepted DVD-RAM from my Palmcorder.  It does not, and I nearly gave the product five stars anyway because my inquiry to their customer service people produced a very helpful and completely candid response that was clearly personalized for me.  In other words, the quality of the customer support almost erased a small deficiency in the product.

Overall, this is a really good product

4000 fonts? well, counting both truetype and postscript versions, so really 2000, then take out the extended, condensed, outline, and other versions of the same fonts and you are left with about 800 different fonts, now that includes an oblique version of almost every font, which I leave in because it's a little difficult to make them on the fly. Many of them have regular, bold, bold oblique, oblique families, and THE VARIANTS ARE NAMED RIGHT, so they are easy to weed out. The fonts themselves are smooth where they should be, and appear well constructed. I cannot speak about the font manager software because I'm on a Macintosh, and so cannot run it, but the fonts are well worth the money

Tried to install with previous Norton Systemworks and Norton Internest Security on system.  Had all kinds of problems.  Microsoft add/remove software method would leave tidbits of programs and foul up install.  Finally went to Symantec site and found Norton Removal tool which completely removed all Norton programs.  Install went smoothly then and Systemworks Premier is working quite well.  (Had same problem installing 2007 Internet Security and installed it first, then found that you have to remove Internet Sec. before installing Systemworks!!  Removed IS, installed Systemworks and then reinstalled IS, now all Norton programs working well.

We have owned 14 PC's and now a MAC. In the last 10 years, we have never had a problem with Norton products. I recommend them to anyone who wants ease of use and excellent customer service. 

Some of the problems people in these reviews are complaining about things that either can be easily fixed or has something to do with their conflict of another program. 

Obviously, you do not run two simultaneous virus programs. Unistall any other previous versions of any Anti-Virus programs. Then install your new one. 

The bottom line, before you read hothead reviews, do a little research. I am a 10 year user of Norton with no problems.

I, too, used to complain about Norton's poor customer service and the awful inability to smoothly upgrade.  That was until I tried two other major products at home and changed employers to one with another major Norton competitor (products included McAfee's AntiVirus, ComputerAssociates' eTrust, and a couple of well-rated free-ware packages).

The bottom line is protection without getting in the way.  According to numerous reviews, Norton provides excellent protection.  In addition, it has the ability to exclude known safe directories and it stops protecting almost immediately when you realize that it's spending a lot of CPU cycles scanning a known good file and you ask it to stop -- for example, the eTrust menu allows you to tell it to stop, but it doesn't take effect until the next transaction, which is too late to speed up a lengthy, trustworthy transaction.  Norton is easy and intuitive to configure, even in its significantly more complex Internet Security package.

All of the products I've tried, including major ones, fail in one or all of these key attributes.

Therefore, I'll put up with Norton's awful renewal process and weak customer service in order to have a product that does what it's designed to do and that is flexible enough to be reasonable about it.

Since recent reviews reveal that no single product provides good coverage against spyware, I do supplement Norton's product with periodic scans for spyware using "AdAware" and "Pest Patrol", and I keep "Startup Inspector" installed and on guard

I'm an interior designer and have Interior Designer 7.0.  It's easy to learn, but I already had used similar programs and I know CAD, but you don't need any cad experience to use this program.  Materials render well, but the library of furniture and accessories is fairly limited.  For example I was creating a game room for a client and only had one style of pool table to choose from and no accessory items such as pool sticks, balls or wall racks.  I've figured out some workarounds such as using round millwork items and sinking them into the pool table to look like balls.  Bed styles are also very limited.  I've downloaded all their bonus furniture, but it's still lacking.  The fabric options are also fairly limited, but be sure to scroll down past "fabric" to find the category "BH&G Fabric". For colors, scroll down past "colors" to Benjamin Moore or download the bonus Sherwin Williams colors. Also the best plants are in the "Xfrog" category.  To save time set your render quality to low for fast renderings, then change it back to high to place your accessories.  The program does a good job allowing you to import your own images and textures.  To show an image on a TV screen, define it as a new texture in your custom library with width set to 0 (so it doesn't repeat the image).  Overall I like the program I just need to figure out how to get more furniture and accessories

I used this application to design an addition to our house. It was very easy to use;it has an extensive library of furniture, window styles, flooring, etc. You can change the dimensions of whats in the library as well as colors, finishes, materials. It made it possible to view what the room would look like with our existing furniture and helped determine what size the room would have to be. I took my laptop and printouts to the architect and builder, and the room looks great!

Running Norton 2006 it took almost 30 seconds to open an Excel Worksheet on my 2002 Dell with 256 MB Ram runing Windows XP.

I uninstalled Norton and installed Kaspersky.
It now takes 3 seconds to open the same file!!


It did take longer to initially scan my machine, so what?  I can do it at 3 AM.  The machine runs faster.  The one feature that I have not yet gotten to work is where already scanned and unchanged files are not rescanned.  That would reduce the scan time to minutes.  Allowing me to scan the machine every day if I wanted to.

This is one of the better photo editing programs I have used.  It is very simple and easy to use, yet very powerful.  Most programs such as photoshop, and even elements are very hard to use.  Although this isnt quite as powerful, it makes up for being so easy to use.  Its nice and cheap 2, what could be better

This is a great product for anyone wanting to correct or enhance their photos and it doesn't require any experience in photography.  I used it to enlarge, enhance and correct pictures I had taken at a concert and I was completely surprised and very pleased with the end result.

I recently purchased Omnipage 15 as I had some old articles I wanted to edit and archive. I had been told that Omnipage would do the job. It did not disappoint. It was fast, kept the format, and as a bonus had made the PDFs it created searchable. I got through my original project so quickly; I have been using it on other documents. It has done a great job. Even the ones that are poor quality have come out great. I highly recommend this program. It has been well worth the money

I took the plunge and downloaded Apple's Boot Camp for the Intel based Macintosh.  I had some old PC games so I thought this was worth giving a try.  Apple's setup process was seamless for partioning a seperate drive I installed just for Windows XP.  Then you get to the Windoze part of installation with the famous blue screen.  It does look antiquated, but I followed Boot Camp's instructions to install.  Windows XP took about 90 minutes via the "standard" insall method.  Apple's OS X as I remember installed in about 10-20 minutes!

Since my installation about four months ago, Windows XP has been running just fine.  I have actually gone onto getting additional PC games of my Windows XP disk.  So this is great for those who want to have a Mac OS X side for work and a Windows XP side for play.  Plus it looks like there won't be many games available in the future for OS X.

Apple's latest version of Boot Camp includes Windows Vista support, however I think I will hold off given the written reviews here on Vista.  Windows XP does just fine for gaming

I bought this Photoshop Elements software to help boost my digital scrap booking hobby.  Unfortunately, it is a bit over my head.  Perhaps if you are already familiar with Adobe Photoshop, then this software would be a cinch.  But, for me, it isn't.  I have spent more time trying to figure out how to use the Elements software versus having actually used it.  If you are trying digital scrap booking for the first time, I recommend buying Scrapbook Factory Delux 3.0 version for less than 1/2 the cost of Photoshop Elements

This is my 3rd year doing my taxes with TurboTax.

I encountered some bugs with non-material stuff, but I didn't go and hand-check the entire return so I don't know if there would have been any material bugs that would actually affect the dollar amounts.  

The bugs that I encountered were the following:

- When asking me for changes to my address which it imported from last year's return, it didn't provide phone numbers.  One of those phone numbers had changed.  Later, when doing the state taxes, it asked which phone number I wanted to use.  At that time, it provided a choice of the old phone number but didn't allow me to update it.

- It seemed to import all the information from my financial institution OK and it reported the dollar amounts of the net proceeds and cost basis correctly.  However, on the worksheet, even though the description said it was a sale of 50 shares, the quantity field said one share.

Little bugs like these make me wonder if all the math being done underneath is OK.  I'm also worried that if you run the program in a different order, the results might be different.  But who knows?  With a cursory check things looked OK.

One thing that I was bummed about was that when entering the buys corresponding to a stock sale it allowed me to enter things in reverse chronological order (and in fact didn't prompt me otherwise) and yet at the end of the program when doing audit checks, it wanted me to reenter the data in chronological order.  I didn't bother since it only affected a worksheet.

I'm keeping my fingers crossed that there are no material errors!  Unfortunately, it looks like other tax products also have these kinds of weird bugs

I am a nurse who works a lot of overtime and has several income properties to supplement my income.  I don't have a lot of time because I work a lot of overtime.  Turbo Tax Primier made getting my entire withholding for both state and federal refunded to me far easier than if I'd taken all that paperwork to an accountant for the same task.  The cost was a fraction of what the accountant would have charged, too.  My returns are very complicated, but doing them with Turbo Tax Primier was definitely not.  I've used it for 3 years and am extrememly happy with it

I've actually downgraded from Final Cut HD because when I bought that software it didn't work with my computer and then Apple couldn't fix so I was out $300. I needed to buy another software package but didn't want to spend another $300 so I went with FC Express. Because I'm a student it only cost me $99. To tell you the truth it's not that much different than the full version of FC. Most people that use FC are doing features which I'm not doing, and other people use it for the title generator and sound editing. I have other softwares for that. 
If you are looking into upgrading from iMovie and want FC go with FC Express. It's cheaper and there is not much difference in the two. If you are taking a video course at a college or other schools, check out the student discount price, it's great.

Final Cut Express HD is awesome. But don't try to learn how to use FCE on your own - buy a book such as Final Cut Express for Dummies and spend some time working through the concepts. I had previously used Adobe Premiere, so making the switch to FCE was not quite the hurdle that is going to be for others. If you make the jump from iMovie, do realize you will need to spend a lot of time learning how to use FCE.

If you are going to edit simple home movies, probably stick with iMovie. iMovie is quick and simple. But for professional results, definitely use FCE. But do realize there is a fairly steep learning curve. Once mastered, editing in FCE is quick.

I use FCE for professional quality editing work when I need to edit down multiple cameras shooting simultaneously  (a feature that Final Cut Pro now makes automatic, but not FCE), and complex editing involving numerous audio and video tracks. I routinely re-arrange my audio from one clip and overlay over another. I also routinely adjust audio levels and mix multiple audio tracks. While FCE HD comes with the Soundtrack application, most of my audio editing is done with the FCE audio tools directly. LiveType is a titling application that also is bundled with FCE HD and enables the creation of broadcast quality titling and titling effects. LiveType is worth the price of FCE HD alone! FCE also includes a huge assortment of both audio and video filters to adjust or clean up original content, or color filters to match the colors between multiple cameras.

Except for simple home movies, where I still sometimes use iMovie, I use FCE HD for everything else. I could not produce the type of material that I create without FCE HD. I strongly recommend FCE for anyone wishing to produce professional quality video results, especially those who need to synchronize and mix multiple video and audio tracks and/or use advanced titling features of LiveType.

Like most video applications, more RAM is better. FCE sort of runs on my 640 MB RAM Powerbook G4. But it files on the my dual 867 Mhz G4 with 2 GB of RAM (but 1 GB would be plenty). If you are going to be doing video editing, a GB of RAM will be very desirable

If you've only worked with iMovie or Windows Movie Maker, you may be intimidated at first, but the end results speak for themselves.  It is true that Final Cut Express HD isn't necessarily intuitive and the options are innumerable, but you will emerge from the other side of the learning curve amazed at how polished your works have become.

You can update old iMovie projects easily; just import them into Express HD and add high quality titles and credits and an attractive soundtrack.  If you want to take it further, you can experiment with an astounding variety of professional quality transitions, filters, and effects to deliver the full visual and auditory impact you desire.

If you already have a previous release of Final Cut Express, the inclusion of LiveType and Soundtrack alone justify this upgrade.  For a bonus, GarageBand musicians will love the hundreds of Apple loops included in the Soundtrack package

I am very happy to see that Symantec has moved into this space and providing added security to people like myself that do lots of pruchase on the internet.

This is truly a revolutionary product for the consumer.

WordPerfect is a wonderful word processor. I have used both Word and WordPerfect. It is much more intuitive than Word. The reveal code feature is worth its weight in gold. Unlike Word, user has complete control over all aspects of their document. Quattro Pro and Presentations are equally capable in office environment. Since it allows saving in MS Office formats it is very handy

First, after reading the reviews below, I noticed that only one person(Merrifield Winters) doesn't like this suite. Upon noticing that he is from Seattle(Microsoft's hometown), I decided to look at his other reviews.  According to Mr. Winters, he purchases and extensively uses each version of WordPerfect Office, even after saying that each one is worthless.  He also seems to have glowing complements for Microsoft products.  This tends to make me think that Mr. Winters is a paid or voluntary basher.

In my experience as a CPA, I have used both WordPerfect and MS Office on a day-to-day basis, both word processing and spreadsheets, and I have found that WordPerfect makes a product with many innovations that are then copied a year later by Microsoft Office.  I guess they save a lot on R & D this way.  Also, WP is much more intuitive for new users.  I have had some clients that start on MS Office, only to give up due to its complexity and lack of explanations.  I suggested WP to them, and they found that it was easy to follow.  The only time that I will use MS Office is when I am supervising a client at their office, while I am complaining about it.

I would give this product a 5 star rating but it just came out and there are a few very small problems. I'm sure Microsoft will fix them in future updates. One problem: when trying to insert an image it freezes when going to the directory which holds the image, you can back out and continue without any problems. A work around is to drag and drop the image.
I miss some of the features FrontPage has, like, photo gallery web components(counter, marquee etc.) But, you can cut and paste code from FrontPage to Expression web and they will work. So, don't get rid of the FrontPage 2003 you can us some of its features with Expression Web.
Expression web is a world class product many more features than FrontPage (CSS, ASP.NET,XHTML etc). 
If you are a web designer like me you will see what I mean when you use this product. Not mentioned in the advertising Expression Web comes with a second DVD with several hours of instructional movies on applications using this product.

I've had NAV 2007 3 user for about 4 months now.  No problems.

I think the key is being aware of these comments and being careful to uninstall any previous versions of NAV before installing.  It is also generally true when installing many types of security software that you have to be careful about running security software from other companies (like a firewall from ZoneAlarm, etc) with that software.  I don't use any other, including a firewall, since I'm careful about my outgoing activity/programs I install and my router protects me from uninitiated incoming activity.  I think a good antivirus program coupled with some good incoming firewall protection (hardware(NAT router) or software, preferably hardware) and common sense and caution on the user's part about what they download, install, and websites they go to, etc is all that's really needed for most people.  A bunch of extra garbage usually only complicates your life in time, money, etc spent on your part usually without a great deal of added protection (this includes user propensities as well... like getting sick of your software firewall nagging you all the time and so not looking at alerts as critically anymore, etc).  A bunch of concurrently running security software also tends to bog your system down and increase the risk of a system crash

This is working out pretty well overall. Our business has been using it for 1 year now, and we have to look back and say it was great, helped us in many ways. Of course there are a few annoying things (we like to write long estimate proposals and it only allows line by line entries-it assumes you are selling items!).
On the positive side we love that it backs up to .mac service every time you quit program, and it has never crashed, very robust. This was an easy and natural progression from Quicken

I originally bought a CD-DVD-RW drive that shipped with the O.E.M version of Nero 7. Every so often it would "freeze-up" and I would have to reboot the computer. Since I bought the full blown edition of Nero 7 there has been no "freeze-ups". What I really liked about this edition is it comes with about 20 programs and you have the option to install which ones you feel you may need

Before I bought this product I noted with interest the negative reviews.  For the record I don't work for Nero, and never have.  I am s software programmer and small network admin who has a pretty fair knowledge of how software things work.  I tried out the downloadable trial and then bought this product after using the trial for a few days.  The download installs just fine in both WinXP SP2 and Vista RTM.  Product seems fine to me.  I guess others have had their bad experiences; I certainly don't know why.  Oh, the reason I installed the downloaded version was that the package product notes suggested I do so for Windows Vista. I used the key with my retail package and then the product went from demo to full.  I am pleased with what I have

As a user of Norton/Symantec products for the last 10 years it was difficult to make the change, but I finally got fed up with the unintuitive bloated Norton resource hog and made the switch to the Zone Labs ZoneAlarm Security Suite.  So far, I am very pleased with my purchase.  I feel like I am back in charge of my firewall, and my PC is running more nimbly these days with 5 fewer processes running in the background.

There is very little I can add to the excellent review by Amazon user Matthew Morgan as I agree in general with his assessment of the ZSS strengths and weaknesses.  I bought it primarily as a firewall and anti-virus solution, and this is where the real strengths of the product lie.  The firewall is very customizible, yet can be simplified enough that my un-tech wife can administer it when the need arises.  I especially have confidence in the virus scanner after it picked up a trojan on its first scan that Norton had missed weekly for months.

Sure ad and pop up blocking could be better but I use Firefox with its integrated pop up blocker, and coupled with Firefox's excellent and free Adblock extension I don't need any help in this area.  Similarly I already rely on the integrated spam blocking in Firefox's companion email client Thunderbird, so any ZSS weaknesses in this area are not an issue for me either.  If you are serious about stopping popups and blocking ads start by  ditching Internet Explorer and Outlook/Express, then you will have less of a need for these kinds of features yourself.

Lastly, I would like to respond to another reviewer's recommendation of using a router firewall in place of this kind of client based software firewall.  You absolutely should use a router with a firewall enabled, but that is only half the battle as it will only give you inbound protection from port-scanning script kiddies.  A router NAT firewall does NOTHING to protect you from Trojans you invite onto your machine via emails and downloaded files you execute, nor will it stop these Trojans from masquarading as legit programs with unlimited outbound access.  So yes, use your router firewall, but ALWAYS in conjuction with a good software based firewall on all your clients.  A good software based firewall like Zone Labs ZoneAlarm Security Suite

Windows Firewall does not block outgoing connections.  Check this using leaktest at www.grc.com.

"Just so you know, WinXP's built-in firewall does not attempt to manage or restrict outbound connections at all. It appears to be a useful firewall for hiding the machine from the Internet (it has "stealth mode" unsolicited packet handling), but you will still need to use a good third-party personal firewall if you wish to manage and control outbound connections from your system." Quoted from the GRC website.

I tested it myself.  Zonealarm did block this whereas XP did not. This means that when my wife clicked on an IM virus, it was blocked by Zonealarm instead of sending out copies to all of her friends and email acquintances. With only XP, the virus would have spread

I have not had the chance to use the item as much as I would like, but have been very satisfied with what I have seen. I was a French minor in college and have participated in numerous ways to learn and maintain the language.  The interactive technique and exercises appear to be far more effective than those I have experienced in the past.  I am pleased with the product, overall

While not easy, this is a very good product for learning the French language.  There is a variety of learning tasks that reinforces the learning experience.  Although most of the learning options were useful, I found typing responses in French to be too awkward and time consuming to use without a French keyboard.  The visual pictures would be more effective if images from France or the French speaking countries had been used.

I have been a huge champion of WordPerfect since it was written by Satellite Software Inc (SSI) about 200 years ago.  I was forced into MS Word and it is not as good, but you get used to it.  One caution, WP X3 does not handle PDFs at any useful level.  Even simple PDFs had so many formatting problems, it was faster to re-create them by hand (which is not a fast thing).

Am longtime user of Microsoft Office. I admit it was frustrating at first to use this new system, but have been delighted overall. Really cool new features (or least now accessible to me): Outlook as nice feature of a to-do bar with just the next few appointments coming up to right of monthly calendar view. To do file management like delete/rename in Word open menu, (as opposed to going to to file manager), the real time resizing and recoloring of text as mouse passes thru the color and dropdown menus  (as oposed to choosing, see if it works, go back to the size menu, choose, see if it works etc.). Their rational in going to the ribbons was that too many features were never discovered for use, and I do feel that as a power user my power is enhanced as I go through the ribbions by clicking on tabs at the top. Bottom line, for someone really into the esthetics of software and who is patient, this upgrade is probably for you. Otherwise the previous version will do nicely.

P.S. If you've not download the free Microsoft Desktop search program, run to rather than walk to is my recomendation.

   I bought this for my dad as an upgrade, since he used the old version of Quickbooks (2002) and his tax guy bailed on him and never returned to upgrade. So, my father had 2 computers, one that was a dinosaur (6 years old!)and one that he just bought 2 years ago (top of the line at the time). He never got around to installing a version of quickbooks to his new pc so he always used his old one. I got fed up with him and his poor excuse for a number-crunching machine and bought this product for him. I backed up his old quickbooks company file to a few floppy disks, installed the 2006 version on his new computer, and the update was a snap. All I had to do was go through a few menus on 2006 and it asked for the floppies. I threw them in one by one, and it not only transferred ALL of his company information and ALL of his thousands of customer invoices and estimates to the new computer, it also updated to files to 2006 all in one "swing of the bat". E Z install, E Z company data transfer, all of this was installed and transferred within an hour (would have went faster if his old PC didn't take 10 minutes to boot up)! And to think, that was my first time dealing with Quickbooks. Not to meantion, I found it easier to navigate through the menus in comparing to 2002. A significant improvement over 2002, undoubtedly

I've been using Norton products for over 10 years.
Each year they get more complex and more bulky.
However, once the product is configured properly
it tends to run well, detects intrusions and can 
improve the health of just about any Windows based system.
The online update process seems to work well.
However if you change your hardware system configuration 
you may have to re-activate the product.

The default (out-of-box) settings ALWAYS needs tweaking.
The 2007 version is even more bloated than this version.

OK, so I got some old comics but I never found number 79.
I always wondered what happened in that one. 
I read 78 and 80 many years ago, but there was always holes in the story.
Now I can find out exactly what happened without paying a small forture for a collectors item.
I will never be able to afford all the different comics and bound reprint collections to own all of the "FF."
Now for a relatively small amount of money,  compared to the cost of every comic at it's original cover price, 
I own every individual comic and then some. Wow, unique. 
This is kind of different. It works as promised, so I can read any story I want.
A story I own that is packed away in one of several boxes from my youth,
or a new one that came out when comics were the last thing on my mind.
I won't buy many of these collections. But having one presents the possibility
to go through one title and see its history. Few people had this option until this product came out. 
Give it try. See what you think. It will take a lot longer to go through than a TV series that costs the same.

Since I can remember, the Fantastic Four has always been my favorite comic book.  It was not just that the characters were interesting and had their own issues, but it was also that they were human as well as superheroes.  The appeal of Ben Grimm, the sweetness of Sue Storm, brash Johnny Storm and the ultra-scientific (and never quite dorky) Reed Richards were a perfect team because they grew together and drew you into their lives.

But let's not forget that the FF also brought many novel comic aspects: The Watcher, the Negative Zone, the Inhumans, and of course, Galactus and the Silver Surfer.

Growing up with the FF I consider the "Golden Era" of this comic book to be the years in which Stan Lee and Jack Kirby worked on them (up to issue 100 or so).  In particular, the issues between the introduction of the Black Panther (one of my all-time favorite stories) to the introduction of Him (Warlock) were particularly interesting.  In this 2 year time frame, Dr. Doom stole the Silver Surfer's powers, the Kree resurfaced, Blastaar made his presence known while Reed was in danger in the Negative Zone.  All wonderful stories, and Jack Kirby's artwork was at its peak.

You can see all of this for yourself in this collection and more.  You can read Stan's most eloquent prose and admire Jack's creative capabilities as one of the great comic book artists.  You will also be able to see the ebb and flow of stories, how different writers took the FF in other directions, how the comic book floundered and how it was reborn.  Indeed, due to its longevity, the FF are not just the indomitable team of 4 superheroes, but the collective effort of great artists and writers that brought these creations to life in the pages of a medium not considered artistic by many.

The collection contained in the DVD is all in Acrobat format and are scanned images of real comic books.  Thus, you will see yellowing pages, smudges, tears, etc.  For me, this is a good thing, because it shows the comics as collector items.  (I don't think making an antique look new is a good thing.  If an antique is well-preserved, that is OK, but it still has to be an antique.)

On the whole, I am very satisfied with this purchase and for a few dollars took a stroll down memory lane in the convenience of my computer or laptop.  I still have my own collection, including those captured in Marvel Collectors Item Classics (the first reprints of FF comics that later became Marvel Greatest Comics), but the collection in this set is unsurpassed and well worth every penny

44 years of the fantastic four, for 40 bucks. incredible. it's easy to manipulate the comics with the reader, and they are extremely easy to see. a subscription (which is still a great deal) to ff now through marvel costs about 23 bucks a year, but here you can get 44 years of the greatest team in comics for less than the cost of 2 years worth of subscriptions. amazing. imagine how much it'd cost if you just collected trades of the great lee/kirby or byrne storylines. but instead you can get 44 years plus annuals just for 40 bucks. crazy. fantastic. this is probably the single greatest ff collectible out there, outside of owning the original comics.

Just as promised, Stan Lee has reproduced the entire Fantastic Four collection published for the last 44 years. Theres no way I have been able to read all of the issues, but it is really easy to pick out the issues I wanted. Some of the comics scanned could have been in a little better condition, but at this late date most of those are sealed and graded by CGC. It would be nice to have a search engine to help find issues with particular characters as well. Overall, though, it is great to have all 500+ issues on one disk for a reasonable price.

If you want to get the digital photos out of your camera and out in email, this is a good place to start.  Snapfire puts the basic functions where you can find them and makes them relatively easy to understand.  It helps if you understand pixel dimensions, but it isn't required.

The first thing you need to do is to see how big your photo will be when displayed on the computer screen of the email recipient.  Simply open the photo and click on "zoom to 100%."  That's the true size.  If you drag your photo into the Photo Tray (see more below on dragging restrictions), you can also see the photo dimensions and the file size by placing your cursor over the photo thumbnail.   

If the photo is too big and you want to resize it, you can do so from the Edit menu ("Resize") by setting new pixel dimensions (e.g. 800x600) or by setting the new size as a percentage of the original.  Then view the resulting photo size by using "zoom to 100%".  When it's the right size, save it.

Crop is also easy.  You can crop to any shape you want, or to standard proportions (e.g. 4x6).  Again, "zoom to 100%" to see the results.

That's pretty much all it takes to get a photo ready for email.  My only complaint is that when you have resized a photo and it is still in your editing window, you can't see its current properties (dimensions and file size) without saving it. (When you save it, it is placed in the Photo Tray, and you can put your cursor over it to see the details.)  

Snapfire has  standard photo enhancement options such as red-eye correction, "quick fix," adjustments to brightness and warmth, and also a "makeover" option which can be used to whiten teeth and remove blemishes.  You can also, of course, rotate photos.  And you can insert text and add picture frames.

The same options are available in other software, but I like the fact that this product is not so overloaded with options that it is difficult to use.  I would find it relatively easy to guide someone through the processes even if they were inexperienced.  And it still has all the features I would need.

I haven't used the Download software, but it appears to put the photos into My Pictures, the standard location. When you go to the Snapfire Home page, you first highlight the folder you want to work with using "Find Files" in the left pane.  The individual photos in that folder will appear on the right in the main editing screen.  From there you can select one photo to edit, or drag multiple photos into the Photo Tray at the bottom for easier access. If you put your cursor over a photo in the Photo Tray you can see its dimensions and size.  

One option that I personally like is the ability to unlock the aspect ratio when resizing a photo.  If you ever capture photos from a video source, you sometimes may find the photos to be distorted.  For example, people may look fat.  Unlocking the aspect ratio allows you to fix the photos.

A warning:  I tried sending a Slide Show to a friend and they were unable to open it without obtaining Snapfire software.  I felt that I was sending Snapfire advertising, so won't be using this feature.

I have evaluated only the free version of Snapfire, which is pretty polished and seems to work ok for me (I didn't run into bugs), but runs pretty slow on my laptop.  I find Picasa 2 and Adobe Photoshop Album to be more full featured.  Both run better on my PC, and are easy to use.  Picasa 2 is free, and I'm leaning that way.  PC Magazine has a good set of reviews of these software packages, so that's a good place to look to learn more.

I'm an advanced amateur photographer who takes photos mainly for my own pleasure but I've also sold some prints and I also do some paid assignments. Anyway, trying to calibrate my monitor to achieve accurate color has been a difficult, seemingly impossible, sometimes almost futile endeavor.  I've used manual (eyeballing) software tools such as Adobe Gamma without any success.  Adobe Gamma got me whole lot closer to my ideal of a perfect color match than my factory default unadjusted monitor, but it was still off... the colors were a little too warm and the gamma a bit too high.  Then I decided to order a hardware calibration tool.  Enter the Spyder2Express.  This thing is amazing!  It was very easy to install and set up.  About 10 minutes later my monitor was perfectly calibrated!  Now my prints match what I see on the screen with amazing precision.  I should have ordered one of these things a while ago... it would have saved me tons of headache and wasted prints

Pros: Good, well contructed, colorimeter for the novice, easy to use software walks you through every step. I notice a definite improvement in my new 22" WS LCD's picture. I had tried Adobe Gamma and Quick Gamma, but these programs rely on your eyes for making brightness and contrast corrections, and setting gamma. My eyes are not as sharp as they were 20 years ago.

Cons: The new updated software, version 2.3, has been out since June, 2006 but Colorvision is still shipping with the older version. Go to their website [...]), download 2.3 (110.3 MB), install it, and use the keycode on your 2.2 version to run it. The 2.3 version changes the target white point for LCDs to 6500K instead of Native. I personally prefer 6500k anyway. Gamma 2.2 and 6500K are the only choices with the Express. If you want more choices you will have to purchase the more expensive Pro version.
After calibration and exiting the software I got a "Can not find color profile" error message. Rebooting solved this.
With the counter-weight adjusted, I still had to tilt my LCD monitor back 15 - 20 degrees before I could get the Spyder to lay completely flat on the screen.

I was getting stressed out on how behind I was on scrapbooking- so I researched scrapbooking software. Ulead's Scrapbook 2 program was rated as an affordable, but good option, so I bought a copy on ebay for 21 cents. No big investment, just wanted to try it. It was a more stripped down version of the program, with 350 clip art items, and 100 pre-made pages, instead of the regular hundreds or thousands (I'm not sure), but that was fine, because I paid 21 cents, right? It was, in my opinion, hard to use, but I did like the possibilities of digital scrapbooking. So I went on the recommendation of another Amazon reviewer, and bought the Broderbund program. LOVE IT!!!! I've kicked out 10 or so pages tonight that look better than ANYTHING I've tried to make with paper and scissors. If you can use Printshop or Printmaster, you can easily master this program in a matter of minutes. Tons of scrapbook templates, tons of cute paper, tons of impressive effects. (I like the "torn" look around the photos, I always loved the look, but could never actually tear the paper to make the effect look halfway decent!) A very affordable, great program. Get it and get caught up! Let go of the guilt and burnout!!! You're still a woman, even if you can't cut paper:) Don't let your first kid have a huge scrapbook, your middle kid have a medium sized scrapbook, and your last kid have a box of unlabeled photographs....LO

I have a Mac at home and the DVD Rom had difficulties with my Mac. I'm on OSX and when I tried to read the PDF file, there was a transparent MARVEL logo across the center of every page that was annoying.  When I tried to move onto the next issue, it would be missing and I would have to reload and start the disc again. 

When I took it to work and put it in my PC at my desk, it worked great, no transparency and a better presentation of menus for usage overall, so I guess I'll be reading this at work when I have time..

This is a great chess game. It comes with an animated tutorial and various games that teach young children how to move the chess pieces and also discusses beginning chess strategy. This is my second copy of the game the first one got scratch and I could no longer use it. In fact, the only bad thing I would say about the game is that it doesn't completely install on your computer. In order to play the game you have to insert the disc in your computer

This DV editing software is one of the best in the industry. While if you one version 1.x or 2.x who really are missing out on this new version. If you do NOT run OS X you should think twice about buying this product. However OSX users should definatly buy it because it adds native support. Also if you do not own a G4 also don't consider it because it is truley optimized for the G4 and will not preform well on a G3

I use this clip-art at work. The selection of art is great. We have several other clip-art collections but I mostly use this one because it is so simple to search for what you need. Some of the photographs that I have wanted to use for backgrounds have been too small to convert to 300 dpi, though. But other than that, I really like this clip-art.

I have used Tax Cut over the past few years, for my federal returns. Tax Cut does the job, and was relatively easy to use. I do not use the state programs as I can file on-line for my state, which is simpler and faster than using the option provided by Tax Cut. I think the high on-line filing fee ($15) is a bit much, since the process probably costs about 2 cents to execute, and a stamp and envelope is not much more costly. That said, filing method is a personal preference. Having to download a state return is pain in the rump for someone without a high speed internet connection, though it probably makes business sense for H&R to structure the process this way

This is the NLT Life App Study Bible in Camel/Camel Leatherlike. First of all, the colour of this Bible is fantastic---actual eye candy for me, so out of all the other Life App Bibles, this one drew me. I like these colourful Leatherlike editions, and they were made in South Korea, which means that the bindings are sewn, and will last. The ribbon-marker is a decent length. The translation is very, very well done, and professional. Now, remember, this is not a 'literal', or 'Formal Equivalent' translation. It is 'Dynamic Equivalence' or, it translates the thoughts of the Biblical writers. With that in mind, the New Living Translation is a re-do of Ken Taylor's Living Bible Paraphrased, which, in my mind, was the most exciting and riveting Bible there was. The NLT is much tighter, and can be used for study. The notes are superb, as well as the character studies, which inform very well about different Biblical personages. The only thing I do not like about this Bible is the red-letter text in the New Testament. It almost makes the red-letter verses seem more important than the others, which is not good. On a practical basis, it is very glaring. I wish Bible publishers would publish just the black-letter text. This Bible is also not a lightweight. It's a good 2400 pages. But, all in all, this is indeed an edition to have. And the NLT is a great, great read. No seventeenth-century English to have to translate. And the colour on this one is a knockout

Having used Vista off and on since the release of the first public beta, I had already become familiar with the interface by the time the final version came out.  Menu and computer browsing are different from XP, but no less functional.  I think the biggest complaints I have heard seem to be based solely on resistance to change.  Change is not a bad thing, and in many cases the web browsing interface makes things much more intuitive for me.  

Many of the flashy effects are fun to play with for a day or two, but most have now been turned off to divert resources to productivity.  My computer is fast enough to handle it all, but I tend to prefer alot of overhead in my processing power.  Utilizing the system monitors, I very seldom go above 60% CPU usage, even when rendering full 3D drawings in Auto CAD, so I would tend to disagree with the "system hog" classification.  I have also tried Vista Ultimate on slower/older machines, and can see some slowing down of the system, so the best warning here is to heed the minimum requirements.

Most other issues that I have heard seem to stem from driver support, and there are several missing drivers for pretty common pieces of equipment.  Usually beta drivers are available if you take some time to look, and it is always advisable to gather your drivers together onto a single CD or external drive prior to beginning any upgrade.  All of my software has worked so far, with the exception of PalmOne Quick Install and my Lexmark printer companion software.  

As for Vista, it is a solid, reliable operating system that has so far proven to be secure and free from any major bugs.  Constant updates solve the little problems as time goes by, and the enhance customization features allow you to tweak the system to get rid of anything that slows you down or even annoys you.  Overall, I would call it far more solid than any previous version of Windows (including XP SP2).  All-in-all it was an easy upgrade that left me with very little clean-up work to do when it was complete.  

As for those calling it a "rip-off" of Mac OSX, you've obviously not spent much time working with Vista or OSX.  There are some similarities in user interface, but those are primarily in response to user feedback of what is desired in an operating system.  Just because Ford was the first car manufacturer to use the pneumatic tire, does not mean that others were "ripping-off" their ideas when they too began to use them.  In a capitalistic society, market demands drive product features, and Vista is an example of bringing more of those demands to the OS standard for PC based systems.

While it is not as polished an OS as some might have hoped for, the foundation is solidly laid for add-ons, upgrades, and enhancements in security and functionality that will come over the next few years.  I also feel secure in knowing that these upgrades and service packs are included in the price I have already paid.  During that same time, I know that I will buy several upgrades for my Mac at around $130 each.  

The real point is this:  "Know what you are getting into before you leap."   Check compatibility for all of your hardware AND software before upgrading, and know what you will expect when the upgrade is complete.  If you cannot live without a certain piece of your total system that is incompatible, DO NOT UPGRADE til the compatibility is worked out. Simple..

I previsouly used an accountant for my S-corp (federal, state and NYC) returns as well as (federal and state) personal returns. That can easily come to $1000. With turbotax you save a bunch around $750. The business product DOES NOT INCLUDE STATE RETURN which is another $50, and the NYC return is an additional $50 (available from inside the program). 

I used it the first time this year, I am pretty good with numbers, accounting and excel. It tool me well over 10 hours to enter the business returns after having all my numbers estimated in excel. 

The customer support by email was helpful as was the community forum, but responses are not always quick. and it is a time consuming process to research questions. The is VERY LITTLE GUIDANCE in filling out the state and NYC return. TT basically gives you the form and let you fill in the areas not generated by numbers on the federal return. TT reviews those returns for errors which certainly adds some value (relative to pencil and paper). It was too difficult for me to fill in state and NYC myself off the fed business return without any software, so I don't see that as an option (to save $100) despite the limited additional information needed. 

BOTTOM LINE - The first year using it will probably cause some of your hair to turn grey, subsequent years should be much easier. The navigation and interface is not intuitive enough for to make the first year smoot  but over the years you can save a substancially in preparing you own taxes. 

One strategy might be to try it one year and run it by a tax accountant (as training wheels) and then in subsequent years do it on your own. (of course year one would be time consuming and expensive but that probably makes sense in the long run.

I usually dread installing and patching Turbo Tax.  This is my 8th year using them and in the past it has been a headache to get the latest updates sometimes.  This was a SMOOTH process.  It self updates, downloads the patches, applies them and tells you when a module you are using is still going to be updated at a later date (and gives you that expected date too).  I found this version to operate just like all the others, but the UPDATE experience is what really impressed me

if you don't have this software, it is a must. I travel on business a lot, and could not live without it.
However, if you have the 2006 version, don't bother with this. I still haven't found any real upgrades with noting. It does update roadways and locations if you need that.

This product has met our needs ver well every year we've used it.  We used the online only version last year, and it was slow and clunky (we couldn't pick up right where we'd left off).
BUT...
The desktop version is great!  Faster than ever compared to earlier years, and no tax category was overlooked for personal or business.  We ran it on Mac OS X 10.4.9.

Buy with confidence

Interface, Schedule C and handing Partnerships and multiple State Returns was SO MUCH better than last year. I don't know why maneuvering around the Federal Return is so much easier than the interface for State returns.
I had to visit the Turbotax forum to get pointers on restarting the state interviews.

You really have to review the printed returns because the software kept deleting one of my large tax credits that I couldn't add except through the forms option and outside of the interview. It took a few whacks at the apple to get the entry to stay in the final calculation.

Excellent upgrade!
Read all the problems other had, was concerned. Did a dual boot, kept XP just in case.
One month latter no real issues. 
Upgraded from XP MCE, HP suppled all the driver updates.

Cons:
Learning where some options have been moved or hidden (they are still there).
Did not like UAC, you can turn it off. I did for awhile, now I've left it on.
A couple of freeze ups, only in the first days.
Software - Upgraded NERO

Pros: 
Faster start up - even with a complex system (3 hard drives)
"Start Search" feature.
"Voice Recognition" very good, there is a learning curve.
"System Diagnostics" with a system tracking record.

Also there is a VISTA compatible version of "Open Office" free download

Have not used XP since (seems dated now). 
Congratulations Microsoft, job well done

I have been reading these reviews for a while and wondering whether or not I should upgrade my laptop PC to Vista.  Would I be an upgrade success story, or would I be one of the disgruntled reviewers whose PC now performs like a chimp?  There was only one way to find out.  I bought my laptop about a month before Vista was released, so I was entitled to order a free upgrade of Home Premium from Toshiba.  I made the order one day, faxed my proof of purchase the day after, and my upgrade DVD arrived two weeks later.  I am satisfied with how fast they sent me the package.  Anyway, back to Vista.  I'd read the reviews, took the good comments with the bad ones, used the Vista Upgrade Advisor, which told me all of my hardware was compatible with Vista and that I'd have to remove some software and drivers.  I did everything I was told.  All I had to do now was keep my fingers crossed and hope for the best.

The upgrade DVD contained a link to an exe file that launched a help wizard that would guide me through updating my BIOS and removing incompatible drivers before launching the Vista installation.  (I did an upgrade, not a clean install.)  I didn't have to do anything -- just let the wizard uninstall the programs and reboot the computer when necessary.  It involved no intervention on my part.  Then came the actual installation of Vista.  It was quick and painless (one hour), no blue screens of death or lockups.  So far, so good.  

When Vista launched, things were a little crazy at first, with the OS recognizing new hardware and Toshiba's help wizard installing the new drivers.  Things went a little awry at this point because the help wizard stayed stuck on a driver that wouldn't install.  It would reboot and try to install the same driver again when it should have moved on to the next one.  So I exited the wizard and decided to install the drivers myself (I had already saved most of them on a CD).  Installing most of those drivers hadn't been necessary after all, for Microsoft had already installed most of those drivers anyway.  The OS felt clunky at first, which meant some intervention was needed.  I removed some applications from startup, managed the gadgets on my sidebar, and tweaked it around until Vista worked for my needs.  It now runs smoothly.  Despite my laptop having only 1 GB of RAM, it purrs like a kitten.  Sometimes the OS is a resource hog, but not enough to render the PC useless.  

I haven't had much opportunity to use all of it and take advantage of its features, but this is what I like so far:

*	The interface.  It's actually prettier than the Mac OS X (which I also own).  The aero glass is very easy on the eye.  I also like the 3-D flip and live thumbnails on the taskbar.  I like the look of the Alt + Tab thumbnails much more than the ones on Windows XP.

*	The search bar on the Star menu.  Of course, we already have that on Mac OS X, but it's nice to finally have it on Windows as well.  I'm lazy and I don't like to have to look for stuff so this tool is very useful and attractive for me.

*	I like that it's more multimedia friendly than previous versions, including Windows XP Media Center Edition.  I am able to burn DVDs and CDs and create movie montages with much more ease.  (Though this tool is user-friendlier on the Mac.)

*	I like Windows Mail.  It looks nicer and seems more secure than Microsoft Outlook.

*	It seems more secure.  Windows Defender comes bundled with the OS now.  I hope this OS can resist malware a little better than its predecessor.

*       The names of the processes running on the task manager are much clearer now.  You get the names of the software and not just jargon like ehtray.exe, which you don't know what it is unless you google it.

*       Network connections are much easier to handle.  My laptop now picks up on my home network the moment the computer boots up.  I had to look for the connection and sign on with XP, but now I can go straight to browsing the Internet with Vista.


There are, like all Windows OSs, cons as well:


*	I detest the whole Cancel/Allow thing.  They ask me whether I want access to something I've just clicked on!  Windows has gone from cautious to downright paranoid.  The Cancel/Allow feature could be an useful tool in case an unwanted application tries to access my computer, but prompting me every time I click on a program, and a program I've clicked on numerous times at that, is just annoying as hell.  Ugh.

*	I didn't like the huge desktop icons.  So I right-clicked and switched to classic view.

*	I was lucky to find an anti-virus software that is compatible with Vista and that uses flawless real-time protection gratis (Avast! Antivirus), but I haven't been lucky finding a compatible third-party firewall.  Neither Comodo Firewall Pro nor ZoneAlarm (free or pro), my two favorite firewalls, in that order, has released a Vista ready product.  (They both claim to be working on it.)  I am stuck using Windows Firewall for now.  And I refuse to use Norton or McAfee Internet suites.  They are resource hogs and overhyped products.  Also, I've heard they are buggy with Vista.

*	This OS still comes with the typical Windows nuisances that I hate, like leaving folders and registry keys after uninstalling a program.  I had hoped they'd found a way to fix that, but no suck luck.  I still have to manually remove program leftovers.  I guess Macs will always be far cleaner than PCs in that regard.

*	This "innovation" doesn't feel so innovative when you've been using most of the same features for years now.  Mac OS X has had all of this stuff for a long time now, so the "Wow!" factor doesn't apply to me.  As usual, instead of feeling that Microsoft has created something unique, I feel more like they have finally caught up with everything else that is out there, not only with Mac and Linux, but with other companies like Google and Mozilla.

That is all the insight I have for now.  I will edit the review as I continue to use it.  All in all, Windows Vista is a vast improvement from previous installments and it's lovely eye candy to boot.  I love to be ahead of technology and I'm relieved to finally have this on my laptop.  (And even more relieved that I didn't have to pay an arm and a leg for it.)  I know I'll be repeating this whole process again with the release of Leopard for my MacBook Pro.  I also have Ubuntu, Kubuntu and DreamLinux to play around on Live CDs.  I love seeing what is out there.  As for potential buyers/upgrade hopefuls, all I can say is if you want to upgrade to Vista, give it a whirl.  Don't let the negative reviews scare you -- instead, you should learn from their experiences.  Use some common sense, from the best of your abilities at least, and make sure to use the upgrade advisor before you install it.  Good luck!  :

I gave my grandson, ages 12 & 15, the Microsoft Student with Encarta Premium 2007 for Christmas.  I thought it would be a wonderful aide in the subjects they were studing at school.  However, my concern was..."Would it be difficult to navigate and not be used or would they even use it enough to discover all the benefits of the software?"  

Well, they are raving about how great it has been in assisting them with their schoolwork...especially in Geometry and Algebra.  Mom loves it too because the math help not only gives the answer but explains the steps on how to arrive at the answer.  

For my book...money well spent. It is so hard to buy a gift for teenagers that they get excited about... especially one that pertains to schoolwork.  I was well pleased with their excitement about the product.  I was satisfied with how easy the program was to use. 

Use the product once and you will find a live-in tutor

Microsoft Student has exceeded my expectations.  It includes Microsoft Math which is an incredibly useful program--it has the following advantages over a graphing calculator: 1) it is MUCH faster, 2) it can explains intermediate steps on certain types of algebra problems, 3) the user interface is both easier and more pleasant to work with, 4) symbolic input is allowed, meaning you can work with such things as cube roots without using clumsy keyboard workarounds, and 5) it is cheaper than a graphing calculator!

I have not yet used the other components of MS Student, but they look promising, too

Photoshop 3.0 has some great new features, but one of the best is "Auto Red Eye Removal."  Removing red eye just takes one click.  It's a real time saver.  There are lots more.  If you have an older version, you'll need to spend some time navigating 5.0, but you'll be impressed

I think this is an outstamdimg combination of digital image software. I have used a simpler version of Photoshop Elements in the past but this one has so many options that the learning curve makes it more difficult to master. However, it is worth it and I keep on learning its possibilities

Give them a break. So what, they don't support Macs. This is a Windows program. It is unfair to give this one star because it's a Windows specific program now. Everybody knows PC's are for office work and taxes, Macs are only for fun. Besides, it's on a flash drive! Cool

My 7 year old daughter loves playing with this typing instuctor game. It tracks her progress so we can see her accuracy and her speed in the days or weeks to come. It shows the child in an easy an accurate way finger placement. I think there is up to 11 games to play, but we haven't gotten that far yet. 

I am only giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because we haven't gotten through the whole thing yet. Love it so far

   Time and time again this program has allowed me to create wonderful VCDs for all my life's important events. Now at every important large family event a slide show is expected. A slide show was played at my grandparents wedding anniversary, the family reunion, and Christmas 2005 & 2006. Everybody enjoys watching them and I truly enjoy creating them. 
    The first time I tried to create a VCD I was confused on exactly what I needed to do. I wondered to myself "what are PAL and NTSC settings, and what in the heck a SVCD is?" I was not at all experienced with video technology.  I phoned technical support with these questions and many more. The representative was more then helpful; he basically held my hand through the first VCD creation. Then he patiently and professionally let me "pick his brain". I am now an expert in video creation. I even bought a DVD player that supports PAL and NTSC so that I can swap videos with my uncle in England.
    This program was diffidently worth its weight in gold! At this moment I am expecting the new version 2 to arrive and provide hours of entertainment for myself and my family.

Please don't expect to get the rebate.  I was very disappointed in the rebate offer.  I sent it in when I received the software.  The rebate never came so I checked on it they told me how to fax it to them.  Didn't hear anything after I did that.  Everytime I tried to check on line it did not show again.  So I started trying everyway I could to contact them.  Finally, I got a response back to fax it again.  Right away, I started contacting them with no answer until finally one day in January-I got two responses-"sorry this promotion is out of date now". This is after I felt I had to get nasty with them sending messages through the website to customer service that no one was answering me.  So don't expect to see your rebate.  They didn't care at all about the fact that it was sent to them and I started contacting them in time.  I feel that it is a "come on".  It is a good product-just don't lie to your customers.

If the "free" Ancestry.com subscription is a consideration in your decision to purchase Family Tree Maker, you might want to know there are strings attached. Even though the 9 months are free, Ancestry.com requires a credit card number along with your name, mailing address, phone number, and e-mail address. Why would they want that information unless they intend to automatically bill you and extend the subscription at the end of 9 months? No information is provided on how to to cancel the subscription at the end of the free period

works like advertised--have your info ready and it will prompt you thru the necessary forms, saving the caculations and determinations for behind the scenes processing.  This leaves you with a concise, good-to-go tax return.  If you ever manually processed more than a very simple return, you know exactly what I mean

After going through weeks with activation problems with Norton Anti-virus and then for them to tell me to get off dial up and go the high speed internet in order to get their product to work and still come up with the activation hang up, I then was referred to PC-Cillin.  

It was difficult to switch, because you get use to Norton, but now I am fine and my computer has been okay so far. It's recommended by most computer technicians..

I can't say enough about Microsoft OneNote 2007.  This product is exactly what I have been seeking for a long time...you can save everything from website shots, files, scans, photos, audio, video, links, drawings, free text, handwriting, etc.  Just about anything you can think of to compile and organize can be compiled and organized in OneNote.  

The interface is designed as a series of virtual notebooks that can be  divided into sections and chapters, with an infinite number of pages in each section.  Each page also has its own title, as well.  Best of all, the entire program is completely searchable--even scanned documents are searchable with OCR technology.  The searches are lightning fast and extremey accurate, I must say.  THis makes the program excellent for datebooks, planners, address books, contact list, agendas, lists, the myriad of things we need to remember, product links for user manuals, genealogy info, cool website links that you don't want to clog up your "favorites" with, and just about any type of research or project.  The notebooks are share-able within a network and real-time syncable as well as usable with tablet notebook technology.  I do wish that Microsoft had integrated the same toolbar "ribbon" interface that some of the other Microsoft Office 2007 products received...  

All in all, I think users will find that OneNote is one of the most useful programs available for collecting and organizing information from many different venues.  Compiling the sticky notes of my life into one organized and retrievable composite has simplified my existence beyond belief.  

I highly recommend this product.  I am a textbook ADD humanoid, and I needed a simple system that is easily searched.  I LOVE the OneNote notebook system.  Information is so easy (and--dare I say it?--FUN) for me to find what I need immediately on my laptop.  In my previous life, I would easily spend twenty frustrating minutes rummaging through three or four messy desk drawers just to find the little scrap of "important" paper that I remember saving three months ago.

One Note is well worth the $79 I paid for it.  It is also available as a free trial from Microsoft.  Give it a try and see how it can help you simplify your life..

Microsoft's OneNote is a vast improvement over its original release.  It is more intuitive, easier to navigate and just plain easier to use.  As a writer it has significantly improved my productivity in compiling interivews and notes for my articles.  I recommend it very highly and I do not, as a rule, make such recommendations lightly.  More bang for the buck

They changed and made Microsoft Office 2007 more in line with the flashy new Vista operating system.  Problem with that is you need to relearn a lot of steps.  Microsoft has a good interactive web site that without it I may never have mastered the new "improvements".  Now that I'm getting used to it, I have to think I like it better if not just because it's a lot flashier to look at

No matter where you are with your PC, whether its brand new or a few years old get this if your using the internet.I had been previously dealing with spyware, viruses and other nasty stuff until I got Spysweeper. I used Mcaffe, Adaware, Spy Bot and a couple others. None of them could clean my system or find the root problem.I would still have a Utillities program to use and maybe another Antivirus program but for the hardcore stuff Spysweeper is the best. Thanks Spysweeper, A happy customer

Every anti-spyware program has its pros and cons... no single program can find everything...

Pros:  Its had good reviews in a couple of magazines, and on NPR.  It has an Internet Shield, Startup Shield, etc so it can alert you if anything has been added to your PC that you don't want.

It finds some things that other programs do not (and other programs find things that this does not).

Cons:  Cost.  Ad aware and Spybot search and destroy are free.  Also, I'm not sure how up to date they keep their database.  Its one of the OK programs if you decide to pay for one.  E-trust's pest patrol has had better reviews (Maximim PC).  

Overall grade: B

I have had both McAfee and Norton over the past three years.  McAfee subsriptions would expire early and customer service could never help long term.  Their website was no help.  Norton's hindered my system performance dramatically and its' Junk Mail interface would only sporadically load in Outlook.

I did my research this time and heard much the same from other reviewers.  Purchased Zone Alarm, received a competitive rebate from my old Norton disk and installed it.  It installed smoothly and interfaces seamlessly with my Outlook, doing a great job in segregating Spam.  The ratings filters work great and my system just hums along.  The scans and automatic updates work perfectly.  No complaints here and I have had it over 3 month

When I first switched over to the Mac (after years of believing in Windows XP's superiority, mind you), it was a Powerbook G4 with Mac OS X 10.3 Panther.  After using it for just a few minutes, I was finally convinced that I was wrong about Mac vs. Windows in a big way.  Once you get used to it, OS X is not only easier to use, but it is prettier, more powerful, and far more stable as well.  Tiger improves on that platform.  My favorite new feature is Dashboard, which brings a whole bunch of handy little apps to your fingertips, such as a calculator, calendar, stock tracker, weather forecast, dictionary, sticky notes, and hundreds more available for download at Apple's website.  Spotlight is also a cool feature; certainly better than any other search feature I've used.  Microsoft will be coming out with its new Vista OS pretty soon, which basically steals most of OS X's ideas.  Personally, I could care less.  Give me OS X any day.  I will be one of the first in line to buy Leopard when it comes out this spring

I had been using Mac OS X 10.3 for a really long time, and it was running very slow since about 75 percent of my hard drive consists of iTunes stuff. I don't know how it happens but it does and i decided to upgrade to version 10.4 and it is definently worth it. The installation process doesn't take too long but it isn't two seconds either and once you get it all going, it keeps your mac exactly the same and it runs at a quicker speed which is great, and it has an added feature with things called Widgets which are great because they are very helpful in daily life, when you wake up, you can click the area for widgets and the time comes up along with the weather and a 6 day forecast and my favorite feature is the Flight Tracker feature because i do a lot of flying so now i don't have to log on to the airtran website, i can look at the widget and it gives me all the flight info, like being on time or delayed. So i say you have to get it, or miss out on the fun

If you just need to type a few emails to friends or to make a little flyer for a party or something, just get a cheap program.  But if you are a professional writer or want something that can do it all after you invest a little time learning your way around, buy the MS Office, Standard or Professional as your needs require.  I bought the Mac version and love the way it looks on my big high def. 24" iMac, 2 pages wide.  I am producing a book with it.  If your IQ is below 50 it may be too much to handle.  Otherwise, bite the bullit and get the features it offers.  I also do training and seminars with Powerpoint and look forward to using the new additions added to this latest (2004) upgrade.
P. S.:  Ever notice how the people who write the majority of these reviews never should have passed any English class because they can't spell the most basic words in the language.  And they expect us to give some credibility to their negative, "cry baby" reviews

I read reviews constantly, but my questions never seem to get answered. So I will try to answer the questions that I had about this item. 
First, It works really well. 
Second, it's easy. 
Third, for the price, this is probably the best you'll get. 

This item comes with the software to instantly burn DVDs. Plug this into your USB port after installing the software. Click on the Instant DVD Recorder, and use the advanced option. You get the whole menu on your screen, you pick what you want, and bam, your video is now recording right to disk. 
Quality? It's fine, you're going from tape to DVD, it will still be tape quality. 
Cautions: Make sure your computer/laptop isn't too old. This item NEEDS USB 2.0. Get an PMCIA adapter card if you're still running USB 1.1. Online auctions sell them cheaply.

what it does is awesome, unfortunately i wasn't able to make it work with adobe premiere on my computer, so if i want to capture with it i'd have to use the included pinnacle software. the free software works and it's pretty intuitive, but it takes way longer to load than premiere (for me anyway) and doesn't do what premiere does. overall, great product, just needs more compatability

CorelDraw was my first foray into vector graphics back when version 3 showed up on my desk at the small "Mom and Pop" screenprinting shop i worked at. Back then, Corel came with OODLES of free fonts, clipart, manuals ... not to mention FREE technical support via a toll-free number.

i stayed with Corel exclusively until version 10 ... enduring countless patches, bugs and the dreaded "odd-numbered" curse (if you tried version 5 or 7, you feel my pain). Adobe Photoshop was always my photo-editing program of choice ... CorelPhotoPAINT just never quite "did it" for me.

Industry demands eventually delegated that i delve into Adobe Illustrator. Being already familiar with Adobe Photoshop's features, tools and "look and feel", Illustrator didn't present a huge, overbearing learning curve. In Illustrator, i found the same robust features as CorelDraw ... which wasn't what impressed me about Illustrator. Adobe's intuitive programs, and their ability to interact with one another ... seamlessly ... THAT is what won me over to Illustrator. Illustrator's ability to edit/create PDF's in their native format? WOW! Exporting LAYERED vector files to Photoshop ... with layers INTACT??? WOW!!! (i could go on)

Now, that being said ... there are STILL things that i prefer in CorelDRAW compared to Illustrator. The EXTRUDE function in corel is MUCH easier to utilize. The PowerClip function is more user friendly than Illustrator's "make clipping mask" function. The ability to customize/edit/add shortcut keys is an amazing feature. (again ... i could go on) (EDIT: i learned this IS possible in Illustrator CS2 via the EDIT/Keyboard Shortcuts, or Alt+Shift+Ctrl+K)

In regards to importing and exporting files from other applications, CorelDRAW wins, hands down. It boasts a ROBUST set of import and export filters, my favorite being the .eps import filter which lets you import an .eps while converting the fonts to curves DURING the import. This is a MUST HAVE if you work with an .eps file created on another computer whose fonts you lack. If i had a dollar for every .eps that pulls into Illustrator with fonts blown out ... i'd be independently wealthy. WHY Illustrator has never implemented this is beyond me.

So, to sum it up ... CorelDRAW is a great program ... but i can't imagine it being my ONLY vector drawing program. Just like in real life, you need a great team. This program, paired with Adobe Creative Suite, meets my needs perfectly.

I've been using graphics apps since they were invented and I remember well who has been the first to invent new features in the major drawing apps. In the old days illustrator had almost no market share because, well lets just say it had no market share.  it is in my humble opinion the most difficult program to learn and to use I have ever seen. Freehand by contrast was adroit, thus it had all the market share on the mac platform and has for instants always been united press internationals world standard. with the release of version 7 of freehand macromedia announced that in order to reduce the apps growing tool set they would now build controls into objects. perhaps this is why some neophyte reviewers think coreldraw is a knockoff of freehand but in point of fact this was corels original innovation in version one of corel draw many many years before freehand copied it. Some of illustrators newest features like the ability to add spot colors to a bitmap were in version 3 or earlier of the corel package. Draw was the first program to offer true transparent vector objects, gradient transparency of vector or raster objects, interactive controls and draws vector lens effects are simply incomparable. The list could go on for days. Corel Draw today is by far the most capable app in the world. It's feature set is unapproached by illustrator. It's output to any device is always flawless and for my money it's lightyears ahead

I received this as a gift and I am very impressed with the quality compared to other PC screen-saver aquariums I have seen. You may also see it used as a demo in stores that sell PCs. The fish are highly realistic in the way they move as well as the 3D graphics. Watching fish move in and out of the gently waving tentacles of a sea anemone is almost as fascinating as the real thing. There is also a FishCam mode from a fish POV. You can select different aquariums and then add one or more fish from a selection of about 40. The choice of aquarium effects the choice of fish. Additional fish can be purchased online. 

If you have an older PC this program may not work well for you. The requirements include "3D graphics acceleration and support for DirectX 8.1". Also, I have not found a way to display the aquarium across multiple monitors. It would be great to see fish swim from one monitor over to the other.

I'm a big fan of iWork and have always looked for new office apps that out-perform Microsoft's apps which have become so feature-rich that functionality has become akward.  I love Pages and the formatting features it provides.  I do more layout work than word processing so I'm real happy with the way Pages works for me.  Keynote is nice too.  I don't believe in lots of slide transitions and builds when making a presentation so a lot of the flash and panash that PowerPoint tries to interject is useless to me.  You have lots of capability with Keynote but its clean, simple interface and robust formatting and import capabilities really works for me.

Nice package to be sure!  I would love to see a spreadsheet tool incorporated into iWork that is cross functional moreso than with Excel 2004 for Mac.  I think that Appleworks is a great start but needs to be taken to the next level.  Perhaps capture the spreadsheet piece from OpenOffice and build into a component of iWork and call it "Tabular" or "Sheets".  (just a suggestion

Apple's iWork software presents two applications:  Pages and Keynote which is Apple's answer to Microsoft's Publisher and Power Point.  As someone who has used both, I can honestly say that iWork blows Publisher and Power Point clean out of the water.  Keynote has some added features such as 3D graphs and the capaibility to add numbers in charts (like a very limited spread sheet) added in this version.  You can make truly professional looking mind blowing presentations with Keynote that will make any presentation look like a multimedia jewel.  Pages allows you to do desktop publishing and print media with the finesse and end results of professional looking print catalogs and brochures.  Both applications are well designed and, just like all of the iLife apps, feature the classic Apple interface whereby all of your media content is available and intermeshed into the work flow.  There  is not really any new earth shattering features in 06 from the 05 version, but mainly just tweaks and enhancements.

By far, the biggest disappointment is in the lack of upgrade pricing availability for users of the previous versions.  You will have to pay full price even if you bought iWork '05.  The family pack version for $99 is a really good buy as you get five licensed copies versus the single user copy which only gives you one installation for $79.  The family pack is definitely the way to go especially if you need to install to more than one Mac.  This is an excellent product that works really tight.  I only give four stars for no upgrade pricing and for no new applications bundled with the package.  If you need to do slide show presentations in front of a group, then the purchase price is worth the cost of Keynote alone.  It really rocks

R u board with PowerPoint? Business meeting seem to go no where!  U think u have seen it all till u try KeyNote!  Folks I landed a promotion thanks to KeyNote just last week! I had a major presentation for a major central monetary agency (dead serious types) and I can tell u that they have never seen anything like KeyNote! 

I have yet to try PAGES but Keynote is the best presentation tool out there. Takes a bit of getting used to since we (the business users) have been on PowerPoint like forever! The best part is after I finished my 57 page presentation it was exported flawlessly to PowerPoint (without the special cinematic effects of course)  and PDF and QuickTime movie!  

You can also import from Powerpoint but u must use your styles carefully so u don't end up tweaking each slide in keynote. Next time I am starting my entire project in keynote. (it does a flawless job of exporting but importing needs some work) 

If u wana wow the crowd with simple and graceful presentations (like the one's Steve throws @ Mac Expo) You open your mind to Keynote! A must have.

Other wow products BTW I have been using on my MacMini is Merlin (the best Project management software ever) Good Luck to al

Working with Photoshop Lightroom

First, I click on develop and then click on Basic sliders. Next, I use the sliders to send instructions to Photoshop Lightroom stored in my hard drive's Picture folder. The Metadata allows me to name my photo images. Lightroom does not change my flash card digital numbers.

You can Heal photo spots and blemishes with Photoshop Lightroom. Check out the excellent help menu in Photoshop Lightroom. The Remove Spots tool lets you repair a selected area of a photo with a sample from another area. In the Develop module, select the Remove Spots tool from the Lightroom Toolbar.

Using the Toolbar

Clone: Applies the sampled area of the photo to the selected area.
Heal: Match the texture, lighting, and shading of the sampled area to the selected area. (Optional) In the Toolbar, drag the Spot Size slider to specify the size of the area affected by the Remove Spots tool.

Keywords become my search engine for locating my edited photo images. My favorite Photoshop Lightroom keyboard shortcuts and Function Keys:

B - Add to Quick Collection
*D - Loupe view
E - Jump to Library in Loupe View
G - Grid View in Library module
L - Cycles through Light Out modes
*N - Remove spots
R - Crop the overlays
T - Hide/Show Toolbar
V - Grayscale/Color
Z - Zoom to 100%

Control-Click Virtual Copy
Function Keys F5 to F8 Various functions

*The above missing Keyboard shortcuts letter functions.

Excellent Instructions in Photoshop Lightroom

Photoshop Lightroom is nondestructive editing of your photos. Your photographs are not changed by Photoshop Lightroom. Your photo changes are stored in metadata as a series of instructions. This saves your hard drive space because you do not have to save your edited photographs.

Lightroom applies instructions to the original photo file. This allows you complete control over your photographs. Changes you make to your photo images are reversible.

Pro Reaction

The answer is Photoshop Lightroom 1.0 developed for professional photographers. This is the Adobe application that is quick and easy to use for editing your digital photographs. Now, you can create your own digital photo style and look.

You have elegance and power in your hands when you use Lightroom application. The Photoshop Lightroom tool suite is powerful. You can use Photoshop Elements or Photoshop CS2 for your difficult photo editing work.

The fill colors in Photoshop Lightroom are white, light grays to dark gray and black. Lightroom's Library views are grid and loupe. You can use Lightroom's clone stamp features and make virtual copies of your photos.

Con Reaction

More fill color themes in the preference file would be a good addition since Photoshop Lightroom's interface is black. Different color theme interfaces in the preference file would be a good addition to Lightroom.

Keyboard shortcuts is incomplete. The following are the missing letter functions: N - Remove spots, D - Loupe view, Control-Click Virtual Copy. There is no help menu's mention of Function Keys F5 to F8 for Photoshop Lightroom's various functions.

Final Notes

Photoshop Lightroom allows you to spend less time sorting and organizing images. You have more time to shoot and edit your digital photos.

I've just started using Lightroom 1.0 and I love it.  I especially love the organizational capabilities and the develop module is terrific.  There is a bit of a learning curve, but with time I know that Lightroom and I will be producing some superb images.

I'm not sure yet if I will bite the bullet for CS3. Digital photography is always expanding, always improving and alas....always getting more expensive.

What does annoy me is the current trend towards very little printed documentation.  Lightroom arrived with a little booklet...only much later did I discover the documentation file on the cd.  What ever happened to providing a basic book with the software???

It is very easy to go wrong with this product. It is being brought out in a relatively simple form that you just know is going to grow. It is NOT photoshop or even photoshop like. It isn't what you use to fix a picture (though you sure can).

Something has happened. Film is going away. People used to have to pay for film and for images that were anything from totally black to whiteout with maybe 1 good image out of 24?

Now we preview and shoot freebies as digital. Lots and lots of pictures. Some of us shoot over 1000 images in one outing. Ohhhh, but it gets more hairy than that. Now digital cameras are taking images that are as good in print as film. And - if you use the original data from the camera (in raw form called RAW data) rather than an automatically interpreted shrunk (JPEG) version, you might even get paid money for what you take.

But those unshrunk RAW files are big? Yes. So how do you zip through 1000 RAW data files and sort them into Aunty EM, Lion, Scare Crow, Oz... or make a slide show, or print certain ones or make contact sheets. and brighten 30 at a time or boost the contrast in this bunch - fast.

     I have used a voice to text translation device for several years. I was interested in the Dragon NaturallySpeaking product for two reasons. My current product is much less accurate than I would choose. Secondly, it does not provide automatic punctuation. The advertisement for Dragon NaturallySpeaking 9 Standard suggested that it not only increased accuracy, but did that without training, and it provided autopunctuation.
     I purchased the product and met with a disappointment when it arrived. Dragon NaturallySpeaking 9 Standard will not install with less than 512 MB of RAM. I didn't know that. My machine had 256 MB. I had to purchase an additional 512 MB in order to load the product.
    While I was waiting for the memory to come, I used the new microphone on my old product. The new microphone was at least five times better than my old one. The accuracy went up. I was very happy about that.
    When the memory arrived, I installed the product. I was surprised when it asked to go through a training exercise, but I did it anyway. I was impressed with the increased accuracy. That was very good, but the autopunctuation wasn't there. I found out that that is an option. When I turned on the option. It began to work. It doesn't do as good a job as I would hope, but for normal sentences, it's okay.
     All in all, I like the new product. I also like the rebate that may be quite affordable. I hope this evaluation helps

It's late at night and this will be a quick review based on my experience with VISTA business. I've only used the product for a week. 

First, i'm at experienced PC user and like to always keep up to date with the latest hardware. I was reluctant to upgrade to VISTA at first because it didn't support my online postage provider's software (so I thought) as well as a game I play (that's now supported, but wasn't at first). 

The one big thing that held me back from the upgrade is that Microsoft sure loves to confuse the customer. Until I ran the Upgrade Advisor I had no clue that the Vista  Home Premium Upgrade couldn't be used to upgrade XP Pro without a clean install. In the end I had to go with this version. I normally refuse to upgrade an OS without doing a clean install first. That's for a very good reason! One last thing I don't like about Vista is that you can't do a VISTA clean install with the upgrade without first installing XP. Why is this?

So, I opened the box and put the disc in after removing several programs from startup such as my anti-virus program. The upgrade went perfectly fine and I ran into no problems at all. I was never once asked for a driver disc. Really.

At first I was surprised at how much background hard drive activity there was at first even when the system was not doing anything. I fixed that by disabling some things in Vista that run in the background. That seemed to help and I don't experience this as much anymore. Overall, programs seem to run just as fast as they did in XP. Maybe a little slower, but I haven't noticed much at all. 

All my old programs ran fine. My online postage software, Internet Security software and even my Video Capture program. So far I haven't found anything that hasn't run properly, but that'll probably change soon.

I did however have one graphical glitch. There was a weird halo effect around my mouse pointer. It seemed to clear up a little bit when I installed some new Nvidia Beta drivers for my 7800GT. It still occurs, but rarely. 

I also had some problems with the Windows Switcher randomly going to non-3d mode. I didn't realize at first it will not work in 3d mode without the Aero theme enabled. I don't understand why this is. 

To be truly honest, i'm generally not a fan of Microsoft products. I'll use them and that's about it. I really thought i'd hate Vista, but I actually like it.. a lot actually. Sorry to sound like a commercial, but I really enjoy using it. I really have no clue why it's so expensive though! The price is way too high. The basic edition is priced ok, but I don't get why the other versions cost so much more.

I'm sure i'll come up with some bad things to say eventually. A few things have been annoying, but I can fix them with a little work. I'm quite annoyed that at default you can't delete or save to the root directory of C: without special permission. No big deal.

The backup feature is nice. I currently have my entire drive backed up every morning at 8am through the Windows Task Scheduler. There was no "easy" way to do this. I had to do some checking online for the settings to add this to the task scheduler.

I also found it strange that the other got I received an error message saying I couldn't edit video from an external drive without copying it to my main drive first! Hopefully I can figure out why this occured. Something I can fix quickly I hope.

Overall, I like it a lot. I definitely wouldn't bother installing it on a computer that's over a year old though. I imagine it would be pretty slow.

Having been an avid windows user (from 95 to XP) my fascination for OS X snuck up on me slowly. Having to run a mac only scientific application, we got a powermac in 2001 that came with 10.0, the very first flavor of OS X. RIght on my first day with OS X, I figured out all the PC equivalents to personalize it to my taste and even set it to share files with PCs in our windows network  - just plug and play, no IT help EVER required (Windows XP Pro won't do squat without the IT guy comes and binds it with his magic password!) Imagine you going to a completely foreign place and start communicating with the locals BETTER than the locals themselves...that's how it was! That was when I realized the legendary ease of use and the silent power of OS X. 
I have OS X on three machines now and one is mac mini as a home server (OS X ships with everything you need - apache, PHP, PERL etc to run professional server at home!) OS X never requires a reboot - except when software update wants a reboot. They run for months sans choking up like PCs that are up for a few days. Besides running your own apache server, you could train an electronic slave called Automator to fetch your newspaper and print the pages you want every morning before you wake up; get organized with industrial quality apps like Mail, iCal and Address Book; get any of the several thousand Widgets to satisfy your fetishes...and I am only beginning to understand the power of this OS. The possibilities seem endless. Trust me - you will not miss windows - you will not regret if you switch. I have not touched my Vaio in years. 

Speicifically to address one reviewer below:
No matter what your field is, you might like, enjoy and benefit from OS X. I know people in many of those categories he classified as 'better off with PCs' that use a Mac as their personal computer (some of them boot windows in it so as to earn their wage as IT specialists for large windows networks - go figure!)
Unlike what he claims, IMAP access with Apple Mail is fantastic, easy and delightful. Haven't had a single issue with two and half years of accessing my mail from a MS exchange server. If you have a mission critical application that only runs on windows, even then Parallels can launch Windows XP inside OS X in 10 seconds and you are good to go. I do this for using my MS Streets and Trips. The only deficit in software on mac platform, in my opinion - no good mapping software.

First off, I gave it 4 stars because for windows users- 5 star product, but for mac users- 3 stars

windows users- if you're still using windows, you are missing out on no more troubleshooting problems, great user interface and next gen features like spotlight, dashboard and of course the great iLife. Tiger is about two times better than vista ultimate, and combining that with the expensive price, tiger is 8 times better. Even though vista copies many of the features in tiger, they are far from being as productive and easy-to-use as tiger's (not to mention tons of bugs and problems). SO GET A MAC AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!!

I purchased a PowerBook last year, so I was forced to start using OSX. Up to that time, I was using OS 9.2 on my G4 tower. Within a month of using OSX on my notebook, I almost completely stopped using my desktop computer because its operating system was so outdated. Finally, I updated to OSX on the tower. Now I have two great computers to work from.

OSX rocks

I had the Hallmark card program on my last PC, and found it to be comprehensive then.  The Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe 2007 is full of professional-looking graphics, and is easy to use.
        However, I would have paid the price for this programme just for the Event reminder calendar!  I have all the family birthdays, and various appointments entered into it, and each time I boot up, the reminder pops up on the screen. Brilliant

This is a great program for making all kinds of cards. You can add your own pictures and text very easily, personalizing the cards. There is a huge variety of cards for all occassions. Also the event planner is very user friendly and you can easily import all your important information. I really love this product. I have had other programs of this type, but the Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe is the very best

The Kid Pix software is a treasure...It is very user friendly and easy to learn. I especially like the templates that kids can choose the colors and fill in the pictures, as well as being able to draw freestyle. I used it for drawing cells, water cycles, atoms and labeling the digestive systems organs for a science class. It worked superbly because I have trouble drawing stick people so I could redo some things as often as needed until they were good enough to submit for grading.
Thanks Learning Company, I would recommend this product to anyone needing a beginning art program

My grand child, 8, requested this program specifically. She used it at school and said she'd have many uses for it with her school work. She loves it and I've been impressed with all this program does. The price is very reasonable for the product.

I love to scrapbook.  When I am doing my own scrapbook I still have to go on to the computer and pick and print my pictures.  With this program I do it all on the computer and get the same finished prodct.  I work a couple of books together one with the computer and one with all my own supplies.  Keeps my creative memories and stampin up products in use while I can put something together a little quicker when needed with this program.
Have a blast with it ~ I do!

This is a great way to enjoy comics of the past.  I enjoyed reading them all.  One thing that use to get on my nerves is you buy a comic and the story is never finished, and you may never read the ending of the story if you can't get the next issue.  This was great because I could read each issue without wondering what happened they are all there for me to read.  I hope they continue to put the most popular back issues on CD/DVD.  It is just great

This is a great set of cool old Marvel Comics, which, I think, is somewhat associated with Marvel editor Ralph Machio.

The problem I have is that, some of the covers are not from the original comics.  They're from the Marvel Masterworks Reprints editions.

Spider-Man and The Avengers seem to include all of the original covers... but...  The X-Men #s 1 though 7 look like heck (Not Don).  They are missing all the very nice half-tone blends and toned grays that were apparent on all the early Marvel comics.

The insides look pretty good.  They've been photoshopped to make the borders and gutters white - which is fine, I guess.  But I like the look of the yellowed cheap newsprint (inside the panels), because that's what old comics were made from...  If you spend a lot of time perusing these gems... I'll bet you can almost smell the old paper and mildew

The future of Comics Collecting

Ultimate X Men the Complete Comic Collection on CD ROM is available at Best Buy for $9.99 and it's a keeper if you love the new Ultimate X Men.  When I would ask about comics on CD and DVD ROM I'd get these strange looks from clerks who'd say "who'd want to buy that?", but it's catching on as a new way to look at comics. It's the ideal format for preserving comics history.  You won't feel guilt about selling your old comics and trade paperback books when you have this.  I like them because you can install these on a laptop or any PC or MAC.  Gone are the days of having an entire room to store your old comics. You can slab them and sell them (the paper versions) on E BAY because you can always read them forever on disc. 

GIT Corp was smart enough to include the annual in this edition. GIT, if your reading all future collections should include crossovers.  That was the mistake of the Avengers and X Men DVD ROM comic collections. Without the crossover issues a fan can't read the entire story arc.  One of the best aspects of the Ultimate series is the artwork.  A lot of care was taken to show that these represent the next generation of X Men.  We might be downloading new comics instead of purchasing them in a shop 5 years from now.

Ok I gave it 4 stars just for the fact that you cant actually hold them in your hands and read them. Plus it is only 70 issues but for 9 bucks thats awesome. I think they could have put another series on the disc like the complete X force or Exiles or something just to fill it out more.Oh and one more thing you can save the disc to your hard drive so you can save it at work and read at lunch without having to bring the disc with you. Highly recomended if you love comics.

This is the second year I have used this product. I found it simple to follow and a great convenience since we were doing all our taxes manually before. It was even better this year since it automatically imported entries from last year saving me the time of re-inputing. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to simplify the tax process!

I had no problems with the install either

This system is very good for road trips.  I just went on a road trip for spring break and it worked.  I had a similar system from back in 1999 from Co-Pilot.  The Co-pilot system was not a accurate but had some features that should have been in Streets and Trips.  For instance Co-pilot had a voice recognition and could verbalize the turn by turn directions.  It could also answer select question such a 'how far' 'next turn'...
Over all I am giving Streets and Trips 4 stars because is does have a great receiver and an incredible number of points of interest.  I would buy it again but just expected more from a product 8 years newer than my last system.  I mean think about how far laptops have come.

Pros:
Simple to setup and use
CD has S/W easy to install
Editing capability to fine tune tracks' start and end times

Cons:
Default in Wave Corrector program not to put a suffix can be changed but on each save; cannot change default setting permanently.
Intensive PC activity may cause program to skip a moment in recording (start that track over).
Cannot append to an existing file.
Could do a better job of finding gaps between tracks.

Despite the Cons (I'm just telling you what could be better), the product does a good job of copying records and cleaning the sound. Worth the money if you have records in good shape and hate to spend money buying CDs to get them portable.

Peace,
LJ

I've used Quicken since around 2004-2005, and have upgraded with each new release. Quicken 2007 is not without a few bugs and quirks, but has nonetheless served as a worthy upgrade for me, and I certainly have not had the dismal experience that some are reporting.

The primary change in 2007 is the interface. It's just much easier for me to find and run reports in this version. I also love the cash flow feature integrated with the calendar, where you can set up known income & expenses and monitor your cash flow. Just a great tool.

I also found it easy to set up accounts and integrate with credit card statements. I have not yet set up investments or mortgage but that's the next step. 

There have been a few quirks. A couple of times I've clicked a button and the program has just closed. Also, I had to reinstall the product at one point because the automated account setup screen kept popping up every time I started the program (actually the underlying reason why I did a reinstall was b/c I was a bit hasty and set up some things incorrectly; once I figured out what I'd done I decided it's just be easier to start from scratch). But the reinstall did seem to solve the problem with the setup screen.

About the only thing I can say that I don't like about the program is that when you are in the register, the control buttons for that entry do not allow you to see the next line item in the registry. A few times I've been looking for a specific expense and it was hidden just b/c I so happened to be on the entry above it. However this is a relatively minor issue.

In short, if you're happy with Quicken 2006 then you probably don't need to spend the money on an upgrade at this point. But if you've found some of the reporting and other features a little cumbersome to figure out, then 2007 solves this problem with a much cleaner interface

I don't understand why people are having issues with the program unless they are not uninstalling all protective software first (anti-virus, anti-spyware, and Fire walls) Warning if you have Norton products download the free Norton removal program just search on Google (symnrt) download it and run it than all Norton products will be removed any that don't uninstall can be removed safely from the add remove program that windows has. Restart the pc and than install the program. do a full update using live update and restart after doing that the program should have no flaws. Now on to the pc i put it on to prove that yes it runs on slow and old systems. I have a laptop with a centrino processor running at 1.7 ghz 512 mb of ram 80 gig 5200 rpm hard drive and to test the capability while scanning i ran the cleanup wizard and the anti-virus scans at the same time while playing solitaire the system manager while these were going on didn't rise above 90% and the scanners changed speed to accommodate each other. As for my tech skills I work in a IT dept that services customers computers for a large retail and I feel confident on recommending this product for vista along with trend micro pccillin. Now to those who read the negative reviews and are getting vista do not buy McAfee because it is not certified for vista the only two anti virus companies that have received certification is Norton and Trend Micro because McAfee is not certified it is not guaranteed to protect your system. If you want to see a list of certified programs go to Microsofts website and search for vista compatibility and they have a list that they have certified and one that is compatible but might have issues use this site before buying security programs for Vist

Bought this usb gps just before christmas for my trips to Virginia and DC. Had to weigh it against a similar product from Garmin. But the price, usability track record of Microsoft and user reviews persuaded me towards this MS product. I must say, this is an excellent value for money. Not only does it it give unambiguous directions (voice), other feature like GPS trail help you determine HOW lost you are from the actual route. Also you can recalculate the route from your current position. The voice giudance in one or two instances was a bit slow, but I pretty much got adequate time to make the turns and merges in nearly all instances. Extremely useful during night driving when it becomes difficult to read street names. The maps are very detailed and some cool features like "Nearest Items" (gas statn, railways stn, bus terminals, restaurants, hotes, etc) impressed me very much. 


Since this plugs into your laptop, its is best suited for your navigator, although I did make long trip with the laptop on the front seat and just listening to the voice driving directions.  But since it does not call out the street names but shows it on display, you would neeed to look at the screen which is ofcourse dangerous. It does say "Wrong Route" when you go ofcourse but you'd need to hit a button to relculate the route from your current position. 



All said, for less than $100 this stuff rocks !!

  I found GT Legends to be a very realistic game. Plenty of user controlled variables.  Tracks, at least the ones I could get to, were well represented and realistic.  While I found the graphics quality good, the overall presentation was somewhat plain.  I would have expected a little more "punch" to the visual representation of the tracks.  

  I was quit disappointed with the fact that so few tracks are available at the start.  I am a firm believer that if I paid for the whole game I should have access to the whole game no matter what my skill level.  This idea of having to find cheat codes to play the whole game is a bunch of bull. Finally, 3 CD'S  is a hassle why not a DVD option.

Ratings relative to other racing games.  No doubt if this is your thing you will like this game.  It's not an arcade game like GTA or NFS but is intended and seems to succeed as simulation.  Several help / assists make it easier for rookies.  Extrordinarily difficult on maximum settings, but satisfying if you "dumb down" the competition a bit, otherwise the learning curve and intensity is extreme.  On line play available but expect to contend with both obsessed and extremely skilled components as well as crash happy losers.  I would consider this the most compelling and perhaps realistic racing simulation around.  Fabulous 3D rendering really requires current high end hardware.  Using with a MacBook Pro (XP on boot camp) it works really well.  Hate to admit of how much time I've spent playing this.  Way cheaper than running real race cars and a lot safer.  Works great with the Logitech G25.  Problems: Missing online code available from manufacturer via e-mail.  Starforce copy protection is annoying (requires original disk in drive) but has not caused any problems that I am aware of

GT Legends is a racing simulation that is based on the FIA GTC and TC leagues.  What this means is that you get real world, present day tracks and old school autos to tear around them in.  The graphics are very good and the sound is amazingly good on a decent sound system.  The trck selection is very good and varied.  The same can be said for the car selection.  

The game is heavy on the realism so if you are a fan of arcade racers it may not be for you.  Though there is a career type mode where you have to run short championships to unlock tracks and earn money for new cars a la Gran Turismo.  This system has been heavily criticized by sim enthusiasts but it gives the game a sense of purpose and truthfully its a lot of fun as well.  If you don't like it you can search GT Legends forums for a fix that unlocks everything without having to do the championships.

To play this game a steering wheel is a must.  Although you can set it up for the keyboard or a controller neither does the game justice.  Any steering wheel will do but I would recommend one with at least a shifter because it just doesn't feel right using panel shifters with these old cars, and frankly its alot of fun pumping the clutch and changing gears.  If you have a force feed back wheel then you are in for a treat as it really adds to the game.

The multiplayer component is easy to use although there doesn't seem to be alot of activity.  Might have somthing to do with time zones as if you visit the GT Legends forums there are plenty of posts about online races.  Just have to find a good group to race with I guess.

Overall I would recommend this game to anyone who really likes racing games

I am an older guy who can remember these great cars from the 60's and the races they ran.  This is a terrific game and great fun.  It installed and ran without a hitch (except I had to call the company to get the online code - a real person answered the phone and sent me the code immediately - amazing customer service).  I am very pleased with this game and can't believe you can get such a quality game for such a low price

Outstanding!  The copy protection kind of stinks but the software itself is GREAT!  Very, very realistic driving experience.  On-screen performance matches the true vehicle's performance.  Many customizaton options.  I did end up downloading a "cheat" to give me more options rather than win them racing 4 cylinder econo-racers but the overall experience is outstanding!  I would highly recommend this software to any racing enthusiast

It re-partitioned my C drive with no problems when it was almost full with a bad sector or block on the drive. I also had drive I was having difficulty formating but director 10.0 did the job, a must have utility program.  There is a learning curve with this program if you want to get into all its aspects but its not very steep.

I had gotten tired of paying the continual price increases at Symantec so I searched for another partition maker.  Finding Acronis I tried it and liked it.  The only drawback that keeps me from giving it a 5 is that the instructions are a bit clunky - not clear in all cases.  Other than that, it is an excellent value

This software isn't actually your excellent version of notation software, but what I mean is this: There is nothing out there that you can get this cheaply that works this well. If you are composing for an orchestra, you will need to pay a few hundred dollars and get the real thing, because Finale SongWriter can't notate for orchestra, but if you are just trying to write down some basic music for your own enjoyment or if you are trying to make your band's music look more official, this is the software for you. 

As a kid, this is something that I can buy with my own money easily compared to the hundreds of dollars that I would have to save to get the real deal, and this provides about everything I need to write band songs or duets to do with friends. It's easy to use, and it does not require one to study the manual for hours to understand. Even friends of mine who do not know how to read music have had a fair amount of luck creating what they want on it

*This is an upgrade edition*

We should cover a few things about the editions before we review Vista. "Starter" is very basic and limited to 256MB of memory. Almost everything good about Vista is omitted. "Home Basic" does not have the Aero graphics flip windows special effects. "Home Premium" has limited networking interaction. "Vista Business" has the extended networking interaction. "Vista Enterprise" has UNIX and Virtual machine support. "Ultimate" has all the bells and whistles. Carefully choose what you want before you make this expensive purchase.  

Installing Vista is very easy. Checking with hardware vendors for patches and updates is a must. "Windows Vista Upgrade Advisor" will identify the changes needed. Many notebook manufacturers will recommend an updates pre-install patch before a Vista upgrade. A Vista upgrade will identify software on the system that might not be compatible. Depending on compatibility issues with an upgrade, a clean install is also optional and works on notebooks although driver installations must be done after. The install sequence is a matter of a few clicks and Vista is up and running. This might not be so simple if Vista is loaded on a virtualization platform like VMware which requires additional configurations of the BIOS and some other tweaks. We have come a long way since the days of Windows 3.1 insert disc #10. The first thing that strikes the user is the sheer speed at which Vista launches. This is most certainly Microsoft's fastest OS to date. As soon as Vista loads up, low and behold the "gadgets" display appears on the desktop with moving pictures, CPU meter, real-time news feeds, real-time weather, clock, notes, stock exchange, calendar and contacts. WOW, impressive stuff... but let's stop the press for a moment and tell it like it is... gadgets is just Apple OSX's "widgets" ripped-off (some might say that widgets existed before as separate plug-ins from Yahoo called "Konfabulator", but we are talking about this being inherently part of the OS, not plug-ins). It is an Apple invention that is in demand, much like the need for a desktop recycle bin  (which Apple didn't patent, doh!). Microsoft settles for just straight out burglary of Apple's innovation and hopes that the user just enjoys it. Truth-be-told, in modern times when everyone is downloading everyone else's stuff for free, Microsoft are even in on the game, and making money of it. However this is all about competition. Since the competition exists (and we may have some things to say about MS and monopoly) we should be thankful that other forces are driving MS to do what it may not have done without these pressures.  Who really cares if Vista is ultimately an Apple OSX rip? This is what Microsoft has always been about. At the same time Apple has openly accepted a Command Line Interface, MS right-click save as or open as and Intel chips. Balance things out. If you don't like Microsoft, then you know where to go. Third party software will probably sway you one way or another. However seeing OSx86 boot on VMware on top of Vista is something that makes you stop and think. Linux users simply front `customization' as the bonus to not going with Windows and in many ways they have a big point to make. Vista has the same lockdown Start Menu system. You just can't change it or put any folder anywhere you want. In a way this creates a standard ("Where does Johnny keep his documents on this system?" "Oh yeah, the documents folder!"), while at the same time professional users just want to custom the Start menu the way they like it, but can't. Microsoft hasn't really got a whole pile of originality going on here (although there are many gizmos included and bundled in the Ultimate pack) and for all intents and purposes Vista is OSX.

Vista is great. Its fast, fast, fast on a 3Ghz Pentium 4 or 1.66Ghz Core Duo. 1GB of ram will run it no problem. The first thing to do is to open a pile of windows, hold down the windows start key + tab, press tab repeatedly and watch as the screen turns into a flip 3D windows (the new Aero system). Also you can get a thumbnail preview of each running window on the task bar by rolling the mouse over it. That is very impressive. No longer are we pinned down to one desktop. Just scrolling through multiple Windows in 3D is a sight to behold and in the eyes of many will make the upgrade worth every penny. Vista also looks a whole world better than XP and is no longer plagued with a boring sterile look. Vista is art but then again the gadgets play an enormous role in this. Apart from that, Windows now has a beautiful fade in and fade out of the windows, some of which are transparent so you can see windows underneath. This is a whole new art dimension that Windows has never presented before and in many ways thankfully somebody decided to higher a graphic designer with all that money they make. Installing Office 2007 just brings it all to life, but that is another story.

99% of XP software will run on Vista. The only problem comes with software that creates virtual drives and devices. It seems Vista security (although Vista has been cracked already) is trying to prevent people from loading up an ISO on software like Daemon Tools. No doubt however someone out there will punch a hole through that one. 70Gigs worth of software running on XP here has installed no problem on Vista... and no BSOD (blue screens of death) or serious flaw seems apparent. While some software did not like the way it was installed, using Windows own manual driver installation just overcame those issues. For something so brand new it is hard to fault how stable this is.

XP users will complain that they have only just learned XP and see no reason why they need Vista. Right now nobody `needs' Vista. However Microsoft has indicated that some games (especially Xbox ports like Halo 2) and software will only be Vista compatible. If you like OSs and like what is cutting edge then don't hold back a moment longer and get it. If you need a system that is absolutely solid, then try out Vista and test on another system for a few weeks to see. You might be inclined to wait for Vista SP1 but to be honest I see no reason why most people can not use this, right out of box, right now. Like I said, I have ported my XP software over and Vista is just as stable... surprise!... well not really. Since Win2K, Microsoft got their stability issues sorted out and Apple seems just as exploitable these days and anybody who does the reading can see that it is. The very existence of OSx86 proves this. Vista gives you a little future boost too and that is probably the main reason to want it. This is going to be the future of Windows OSs for the next few years. The last time Windows released an OS was around the time of 911. It has been 6 years, the longest gap between Microsoft OSs in history, and it is worth the wait, especially imagining what Vista SP2 will deliver on. Many of us are still hoping for a lot of big things to change though. Why are we still using keyboards and why do we have to interface with our hardware this way? Bring on the multi-user touch-screen PC and give us a real show! Don't you think we all deserve it? We do.

The bottom line here is that this is stable future-tech. If that makes your eyes go bing then don't hold back a second more and just get this thing. You will be very pleased at experiencing the rush of a new OS once again.

I got this on request as a Christmas gift last year, along with an M-Audio KeyStation 61es keyboard. The combination of the two works really nicely on my PowerMac. I didn't really start going through the lessons until about a week ago due to shoulder surgery I had at the beginning of the year, but so far so good.

For the record, I studied music for about 10 years when I was younger, though not piano. While I still remember much of that earlier training (in particular, how to read music) there's plenty new about piano so that I'm not feeling these early lessons to be too easy (though they may be slightly easier).

I do have a few complaints about the program. First, as another reviewer noted, you cannot turn down the volume of the accompaniment / instructor. This makes it impossible for me to hear my own playing when going through a lesson, even with the KeyStation's volume cranked all the way up. So what I do is play the instructor audio once to get the idea, then play solo so I can hear all my flubs and faults (and also when I get it right! ;-D).

Second, the program seems slightly crash-prone running on Mac OS X 10.4 (a.k.a. "Tiger"). I've found it will crash at least once in any given practice session, and when I re-launch I'm right back where I started for that session. True, I can just click the right arrow until I get to where I left off, but if I'd been going for a half-hour and managed to get through several screens it's a little irritating.

Third, though not a bug, is how the music is displayed on screen. As another reviewer noted, the programmers / designers seemed to feel that 640 x 480 was plenty of resolution, but this means that many of the songs you play cover multiple screens. "When the Saints Go Marching in" took up 3 screens, which seemed ridiculous when I'm on a 1280 x 1024 monitor. Yes, the pages auto-turn for you when you to the end of one, but the first time or two through a song it's very irritating as I'm trying to read ahead and figure out what fingers need to move next.

But maybe most importantly, I'm finding that this software, while it certainly teaches the fundamentals of playing well enough, still doesn't fully take the place of a real, live instructor sitting there with me. In particular, I can tell that my hand position is not completely right because when I play the fingers in my right hand (especially my ring finger) get sore rather quickly, like I'm straining the muscles/tendons on the top of the fingers. I've got large long-fingered hands, and even with the full-size keys of the KeyStation I find it hard to get all five fingers seated on the keys without at least two fingers curling quite a bit. Maybe this is normal when you start playing piano, but it would be nice to have someone there to confirm whether I'm doing it OK. I'm certain a live instructor would see anything I was doing wrong right away and help me correct it right then and there. Videos showing proper posture are all well and good, but the program can't see me or tell me that I have a posture problem. All it can do is say that I played a wrong note or that I held a note too long / short.

I'm hoping that I'm not developing any other problems with my technique, since I do plan on moving to a live instructor at some point when my schedule opens up and I've become certain that I can devote the time to serious practice. I'd hate to develop some decent playing skills only to find I have to start over because my core technique is all wrong.

So, five stars because of the generally good quality of the technical instruction, minus one star for not being able to point out purely physical problems with my playing. Not the program's fault, but I can't give five stars to something that can't perfectly replace a live teacher

I've been using this piano trainer for about 2 months now, and am up to lesson 100 or thereabouts. I've been spending about 1/2 hour each day with it, on an OS X Mac with a MIDI/USB piano keyboard attached to it. Each day, I start at my "tail" lesson, then work through all of the other ones up to my "current" lesson. Then I do the "tail" lesson again. If I can play it with the computer rating me at 99 or 100%, I declare that I've "passed" that lesson, and move the tail up to the next lesson for the next day. If I don't pass, I keep the tail where it is. At the other, "current", end, I usually move up one lesson per day, unless the current one is particularly challenging. I also usually have one "goof off/preview" lesson where I just relax and try to have a little fun with the next lesson beyond the current one, giving myself a little treat to look forward to. I usually take the weekends off, and only do my lessons if I'm feeling like I want to. During weekdays, I find it is a nice way to just do "something different" after a day at the office, and quickly find myself sucked in; the lesson time passes quickly.

The system has worked quite well for me so far. I've stayed motivated and am making definite and consistent progress. 

The program works very well for the most part. Each lesson displays the sheet music, and has a button that plays the lesson as it should sound. Plus, most lessons have video snippets of an instructor giving detailed examples and hints. Most lessons also have a button where you can play accompanied by other instruments. After you play the lesson, the computer rates your performance, from 0 to 100% correct, and shows on the sheet music where you made mistakes (wrong notes, notes played too long or short, etc.).

There are a few bugs in the OS X Mac version. The worst is that the sound volume level for the instructor / example music can't be changed. There's a slider for this in the preferences window, but it doesn't work. The volume is stuck at maximum, so it is far, far louder than the sound coming from my own playing. The other serious bug is that the automatic lesson grader almost always indicates that you've played the final note of the lesson too short, even if you hold it down far too long; this seems to be especially true if the final note is a whole note. The other bug I regularly see is that a window will pop up saying something about the script interpreter crashing. This doesn't seem to cause any problems, but it is annoying. Other than that, the program seems solid. It uses a better piano sound than the one that comes built-in on the Mac; it still isn't realistic like the ones on the Casio and Yamaha keyboards, but it's good enough

This CD had so much useful information, and a great deal of it I had not even considered.  Usually I can glean one or two things that I get from a book (CD) that makes it good and useful, this had many things I found useful.  It was in a format that was easy to follow and I could skip over the parts that I did not find useful.  Some sections were more geared for military personnel or foreign diplomats, but I guess I could use some of the strategies if I was traveling overseas?  Some of it was also basic common sense, but if there was ever an emergency, it would be good to have it to refer to just to be sure we did not forget something.  I also think some is more useful if we were already attacked as I would not use many of the strategies today.  I kept waiting for the part where it would say buy lots of guns and hide cash and gold coins, but there was none of that.  Overall, there are so many things in here that I had not thought about, and it was presented without a lot of fluff -- just the facts -- in an organized, easy, and comprehensice manner.  I would highly recommend it for the entire family

I have recently become more serious about web page design.  I looked at other products and tried them out.  However, Dreamweaver has exceeded my expectations.  I am not an advanced user by any means, so my rating might have a "new user bias" to it.  My first web site used a WYSIWYG editor similar to Frontpage.  Then, I downloaded the 30 day trial of Dreamweaver and redesigned the site.  Productivity greatly increased and the interface is very easy to navigate, once you get used to it.  The new web site is by far more impressive, user friendly, and feature rich without a cut in productivity.  Learning Dreamweaver is a pleasure.  If you are familiar with web design, the learning curve is very nice.  I was making web pages within a couple of hours of downloading the trial.  Tutorials are readily available in the Help menu and on the Adobe web site.  Of course, you can always find a good book here on Amazon.  If the price of Dreamweaver can fit your budget and you are serious about making impressive web sites, I highly recommend the consideration

I think that any paranormal investigators that deal with EVP's (Electronic Voice Phenomenon" can agree that this is probably the most important program that you can own. This is used to apply noise reduction, loop, slow-down, normalize, etc. when editing an EVP. Adobe if you are reading this review please oh god please someday release this product for the Mac. A great and certainly very powerful program

We've been using this program for our business for about a year now.  I find it to be easy to use and a good value for the money.   We used it to create invoices for our customers, to keep track of our checkbook, to have easy access to the amount of our sales each month, quarter and for the year and more.   I would recommend it for small businesses starting out.

I recently left Corporate America and set up a consulting practice which required balancing my own books instead of relying on the Finance group. I looked over several offerings and decided I only needed to track billings and create invoices. QuickBooks Simple Start handles these tasks quite well in addition to providing useful reports on outstanding invoices, sales by customer and a host of other great cuts at the data. I do agree with other reviewers that expensing of business supplies is not that well done and I couldn't figure out a way to depreciate a computer and software that I bought for the business. On the positive side, it is very simple to use and given the limited transactions avialable pretty much forces you to do it right. Overall I would purchase this product again given it's low cost and ability to meet my basic needs of keeping the books for my small business

I'd been vacillating between Money Small Business, Quicken Business, and then stumbled across QuickBooks Simple Start.  I bought Quickbooks because I expect my small business to grow to need the more advanced versions.

The install was simple, the set up equally easy, and using it a breeze.  It does just what I needed, with the exception of allowing me to charge by the hour instead of the product (or maybe I haven't figured out how to do that yet... that's what cost it a star.  If it can do that, bump this up to a five.)

Clean, simple interface, easy to use.  Thrilled I bought it, but paid twenty dollars more for it last week than it's listed for now. :(  Aw, well.  It's tax deductable..

My husband and I bought two copies when it was a Gold Box featured product so he could install it on both of our computers. He is a computer consultant and rates ZoneAlarm at 4 stars because, after using it for a few weeks, we find too many spurious alerts for items that ZA should have had on their "safe" list, particularly the "suspicious activities" of the OS Firewall. This program is puzzling for a casual user such as myself to navigate alone. I would still rather have more protection than I can handle, rather than a dummied-down version that I would understand better but that might not provide the virus protection we need, but he says he wouldn't recommend this to his novice clients unless they wanted a lot of hands-on control of their systems.

I find Ad Aware better than SpyBot which gets rec's from all the popular magazines. Why? The interface is more sophisticated. Spybot is not very intuitive and requires more clicks of the mouse to do what you want. Ad Aware is more of a one-click solution. 

But the worst thing about Spybot is that, during a trial on my client's pc, it would not update. An attempt to update the definitions file would result in a progress bar which stalled midway through. You could leave it there for hours, and the process would never complete. This, on a fully functional broadband internet connection. After that happened, I uninstalled SpyBot, then installed and registered Ad Aware directly from Lavasoft. 

Lavasoft's baby is a first-rate program that, with the important addition of Ad-Watch which you must register to use, effectively puts an end to spyware.

Diego, below, must be confused. There is never a charge to update the program or to download definitions. I used Ad Aware for two years without paying for it (it's free) and only registered to get the Ad Watch program to protect my elderly parents from nasty spyware which had disabled their PCs.

I read recently a review of Ad-Aware in PC WORLD. The writer was mentally retarded. He claimed, falsely, that Ad-Aware possessed no real-time spyware blocker. What he was doing was comparing the FREE version of Ad-Aware to the PAY versions of programs like Webroot. Is that fair? No. Nevermind. "Please discontinue my subscription to PC WORLD, because I insist upon intelligent articles, and detested reviews that are influenced by bribery."

I think there needs to be a law where anyone who reviews anything should disclose how much they were paid by a certain vendor. In the case of PC WORLD I would estimate a mere $10,000, but that's enough to buy the writer's daughter's braces, isn't it?

If you drop $27 on Lavasoft you get the Real-Time spyware blocker which works like a charm. And you can take your copy and share with friends and elderly parents, ho-ho-ho!

You will find, however, that the Pop-Up interceptor is overly aggressive and can't be used all the time. It tends to cause problems on certain web sites. I recommend just using the most critical protections.

If you're curious, download the free edition directly from lavasoft. Then if you like it, register and get Ad Watch. I think you will like it.

The criminal organizations that write and distribute spyware bundled inside their games or utilities should be prosecuted the same as virus writers, because their junk disables or reduces the performance of infected PCs. Spyware is no better than smashing my car windshield with a hammer. Uninfecting a PC potentially costs $100 and up, and requires a few days of down-time. I think this is a law enforcement matter, and that the police should be knocking on the door of the guilty corporations. Executives that made the bad decisions should serve jail-time, same as any vandal who has caused millions of dollars (collectively) of property damage.

The reason major players in the PC marketplace are silent on spyware is it's driving lots of new PC purchases. People find their old PC (infected with spyware) isn't as fast as it used to be, and they think the solution is to buy a new one. The real solution is to install and register Ad Aware. But a non-technical person will not know this, and most people are non-technical including many people I care about. I am angry at the way the computer scene is today, and how non-technical people are getting the shaft.

I bought this as a means to cost-effectively to re-build my system. It installed without any problems. I chose the 'full format' instead of the 'quick format' at the very beginning. Be warned, this takes about an 1.5 hours! The HD is a WD 320 GB 7200 RPM EIDE with 8 MB cache. I wonder if the 'quick install' would have gone quicker? Anyway, after that format, the OS was ready to go in less than 30 minutes. There were a lot of updates (75 or so). And you will manually have to update to IE 7 and WMP 11.0 if that is of interest to you. Oh and don't forget to install the drivers for the MB. I could not get updates until I installed the drivers for the ethernet. I have not tried the Vista update and may hold off for a bit. The form was in the package for the upgrade.  For my other machines, XP has been better than their previous OS versions I have used. I don't know what the differences are for the retail version versus this OEM version. This is the full install with a key for authentication. The only difference is the money you will save with this OEM. And I don'y see the major differences between Home and Pro editions. For me Home and Pro seems the same. Early on, I heard Pro was better (or more stable) than Home. I don't think it matters anymore. I docked it one star for the potential security problems and the authentication stuff. All in all, I am pleased with the purchase. And I am a satisfied Amazon customer (and their affiliate Tigerdirect)

I've been using EazySpeak Spanish for about a week now and find it HIGHLY enjoyable and amusing. I do, however, have to agree with other reviews in that it is not for children. I was a little surprised at the semi-nudity of the characters and how, in one exercise, one bikini-clad female had semi-circles in her chest region to suggest nipples. Also, elsewhere in the program, one is introduced to the Spanish words for beer, rum, brandy, cigarettes, and various types of wine. All of these topics should be off-limits to a 12 year-old, which, the box claims, EazySpeak is suitable for.

Overall, the program is fun. However, a parent should know beforehand that there are exercises such as "Help the Thief," which is a numbers game in which you assist a burglar in breaking into a safe. Also, there is an entire exercise dealing with drinks which takes place at a bar. Finally, there are the occasional moments spiced with "adult humor"... one such moment being a man kissing his wife goodnight while in bed, but fantasizing about a cute female at his job. Again, not child-appropriate, but all of this should be left to the discretion of the buyer.

The average person doesn't usually have the cash on hand to hire an estate attorney at $300+ an hour to put together a will or living will for them.  The average person with kids is even less able to afford it but the irony is that they need it the most in order to assure their kids are taken care of and that involves additional intricacies related to trusts, guardianship of the kids and such which makes the whole thing cost even MORE.  

Now that my custody arrangement has gotten sticky, I'm remarried and have something in the way of assets, I decided to spend a few bucks on my will.  Key to that notion is 'a few bucks'.  I still didn't have thousands to spend.  So, I bought a copy of nolo's Willmaker Plus.

If you're like me, when approaching the topic of wills, legalities, living wills and trusts, your gaze kinda glazes over and you realize that it is all very big and very complex and far too big or complex to 'get' without a law degree.  This software makes it a no-brainer.

It asks you questions and you either fill in information (like someone's name) or answer yes/no to very clear, easy to understand questions.  Where free form text is allowed, you get very clear instructions and examples.  It also adjusts the questions and forms depending upon what state you live in and what options you selected on previous questions.  

Most importantly, you don't just go through this experience blindly.  It guides you through each step with detailed background information and explanations and offers reference material on each item beyond even what's offered in the instructions.  At the end of the process, you know what you filled out and why.

At the end of each form, it automatically saves it to a saved library of forms that you have filled out for quick access later and gives you the option to preview, modify or print.  The printed copies come complete with signing instructions and notary and/or witness fields.  

Having all of the contact information for everyone together before hand and a general idea of what needed to go to who, it took me about an hour to create a will (complete with a UTMA), a living will, a temporary guardianship letter for my son and his step dad, a final arrangements declaration and automatically generated letters to my executor and elected health care agent.  

It is exactly what I needed.  It's quick.  It's in plain English.  It's easy.  It's cheap for what you get, which is essentially hours of an attorney's time for a fairly cut and dry task and peace of mind that everything is taken care of.

I used to have Norton for years.  After all it was the industry standard, but after it let many a virus slip on through; I had enough.  
I knew I would not get McAfee as I have repaired many computers with Mcaffee in the past (working in the computer field.)
So I checked all the ratings and saw that Trend Micro and Kaspersky did the best in all of the ratings.  I dediced to go with Trend Micro since their software edged out Kaspersky.
Well two years later I have not looked back.  I got a Trojan recently, but I called the free tech support at Trend Micro (they are the only antivirus company that offers that)- and they bailed me out.  They were very helpful, spent a lot of time with me, etc.  After following a few quick instructions I was back in business and my computer was clean as a whistle.  
When I had Norton, I would have to email them or be charged $40 for a phone call after their software let a virus in.  Talk about nerve.  No more, Trend Micro is head and shoulders above the rest

I work in IT, for a Cable ISP. I used to swear by Norton's products, until 2003. After the 2003 Antivirus, their products have been junk, however with the only other mainstream security software out there pretty much being McAfee (which is wretched, stinking garbage and I've never known anyone who had it to NOT get a virus), I considered it to be the lesser of two evils. At my work we frequently refer people to Trend Micro's Housecall, and the consensus amongst my colleagues seems to be that it does the best job of cleaning up infected systems for those of our customers whose service is suspended due to virus activity. I found that dozens of people were recommending the housecall scan over those of Norton, McAfee, and even the program that our company partners with to provide our free customer security suite. Upon finding out about Trend Micro's 30 day free trial, I decided to give it a shot. 

I think it's a great program, and is as user friendly as possible for the amount of features it has. It loads quickly and isn't a resource hog. I think it's really cool that you can see the mac ID's of people connected to your wireless network.

The bad reviews of this program frustrated me. You can't fault a product for having 'larger updates than Norton'... I'd RATHER have a suite that was releasing more updates that were greater in size than Norton - how novel to find a security suite that does its job! It's not Trend Micro's fault you live in the boonies and use dial up. And I don't think it's fair to give it a 1 rating just because you have a particular type of epilepsy where that is what sets you off... If I am eating at a restaurant, and somebody next to me is wearing perfume that triggers a migraine headache for me (also a recognized medical condition), I don't give the restaurant a bad review. After all, the food was great.

The only thing I don't like is that if you are trying to change the licence key for the version you have on a machine, there isn't an apparent way to just change the key... so I took the ten minutes to uninstall and reinstall the program, and then enter in the new key (literally, I think it took less than 10 minutes).

Keep in mind kiddies, installing ANY security suite on an infected pc or one that has scores of junk left in the registry from McAfee, Norton (or both - some people think that if you install 2 it "protects you more" - SO NOT TRUE) makes you much more likely to experience problems with the install. I NEVER had problems with uninstalling Norton (on the 5 pc's that I did it on) and installing PC Cillin, even without deleting the registry entries that Norton left behind. And as always with a security suite, It's always best on a fresh install of windows.

Overall, it runs quickly updates often and has almost every component you could want out of a suite. I personally think it's the best option out there - but keep in mind, you can get a flu shot but it doesn't guarantee that you're not going to get the flu, it just highly reduces the likelyhood. It's a great program and I think it's cool they give you a specialized area on the website to manage the licences and get access to personalized info based on the products you have. 

Also - Norton charges 30+ bucks for support. McAfee only has online support. PC Cillin is free (not that I've ever had to call since I've never had a problem with the program).

P.S.: For the person who reviewed in broken english that they couldn't log into yahoo mail, ten bucks says your security and privacy settings in IE (only someone who uses yahoo mail would use internet explorer) are probably set at "high" and that's why you can't log in

So, the interface for the new version of Internet Security is very nice and is very easy to use.  I have used the previous version in the past upon the recommendation from CNET as the one of the best internet security suites available.  I have not been disappointed.  The software was very easy to setup and start up and seems to be very secure with regular updates and scans.  Fortunately, I have a prety isolated network so I don't worry too much about virus contamination but I do want to monitor my network's usage - especially since I have a wirless system.  The software allows me to monitor such activity easily and alerts me to anyone trying to get on without permission.  The one time I did have a virus, the realtime scan function caught it before it could embed itself into my system and deleted the malicious code immediately.  I haven't seen too much activity overall from the sentry software which is a good thing (I think) and attests to the overall functionality of the software (I think).  Either this is a great piece of programming or my computer has been taken over by spyware gangsters in Russia and I'm none the wiser.  I hope this help

It seemed like it took forever to install this software. After properly uninstalling my previous software (norton) and all of its registry enteries, I began installation. My initial problem was that as I own 3 computers, and was running PC-Cillin one one of them, I had problems registering this software....even though this has its own serial number. It is rather amusing that as I purchased a multi pack...the registration process makes no allowance for those of us which own multiple computers. As of 2 days later I am still waiting for a fix. 

The rest of the installation was easy...it tiresome ( I live in a rural area and have to use dial-up). All was a smooth install except for the lack of error message, when line noise dropped connection (I did not figure this out until after I had performed my first scan and was informed I did not have the most recent version of anti-virals). Decent GUI interface, but clunky. I would rather the development money goes into the software anyway.  IF you are a new user it might be more confusing...but the quick start guide is reasonably set out...once you figure out that the order on the quickstart guide is different than the order on the program interface. I am reminded of what Norton used to be like before it sold out to marketing companies/spyware/greyware providers without telling us consumers.

I would recommned this to anyone. My only caution is to READ THE DIRECTIONS before jumping into the install. But shouldn't even experienced users do that? I just wish the quickstart guide checklist was in the same order as on the interface. I am confident because of my past experience that I can get the registration problem fixed...when someone who is a native english speaker reads my email to customer service. Dont bother calling the phone number, by the accents of the staff it just goes to a call center outside of the USA (probably in India)

For me the upgrade was a great thing.
There had always been things about Office XP that just didn't work right.
After the software was loaded, indeed I had some configuration issues. It worked, but it wasn't slick.
But Microsoft Help stepped in. The software support guy took control of my computer using net-meeting and looked at all the configuration issues. Turned out to be some conflicts with my virus protection (I've had these before, P.N.) and with some Microsoft add-ins. Point is, he made the conflicts go away.
Microsoft "help" has been a sometime thing, in the past.
Today, it rose to the top shelf.
I am quite happy with Office 2003.

Good product but when are they going to fix the screen that says you have not UPGRADED ! ! ! ! It drives me nutz to have that pop up every time I go to Quicken online. I have written as I'm sure others have but still it is there with no way to remove it even after "registering" my upgrade.

Quicken is easy to learn, easy to use, maybe not so easy to import and export data as it is very propriatary but still and all I love it online for portfolio views and data at a glance.

When I slammed the Canon PIXMA 4300 for being terrible, I indicated that I only write reviews when the product is very good, or very bad.  In this case, this product is truly amazing.  In fact, it is the coolest software I have ever owned or used.  In fact, I'd say this is the coolest thing I have ever owned, but that would make me a geek.  Buy it without reservation!

Before I write my review, I would like to note that I have had one semester of Mandarin Chinese, so I am familiar with some of the most basic words and phrases.  I am using Rosetta Stone in addition to my Chinese classes so that I will learn to speak better and be able to listen to Chinese on a regular basis outside of class.

I read the User's Guide before -- and while -- using Rosetta Stone.  The program is not 100% user-friendly, so I needed the User's Guide to find out how to get started in the program, how to put the program in test mode, how to view my test scores, etc. 

It is very easy after you read the user's guide and play around with the program for a little while to figure everything out.  You can select "preview" to see and hear what you will be learning, "guided exercise" to be taken through the lesson automatically, or go through the numbered exercises one by one.

With most exercises, you hear a description and/or see a photograph, and you have to match up the description and/or photo with one of four answer choices.  Depending on the exercise you do, you will have to recognize characters, spoken words, or both.

There are three options for reading and writing text:  Pinyin, simplified, and traditional characters.  These are on the lower right of the screen.  I am using traditional characters in my classes, so I always select the traditional characters option.

There seems to be a lot of confusion among reviewers about the writing section.  On my CD, there are four different types of exercises you can do in writing:  Two exercises allow for pinyin only and the other two allow for pinyin, simplified, or traditional characters.

Traditional and simplified characters can be entered into a text box using the drag-and-drop method.  If you use pinyin in writing, you have to make rather awkward tone mark selections and get them over the right letter or your answer is wrong.  Although some people would claim pinyin is easier than characters, in Rosetta Stone it is infinitely easier to memorize characters due to the constant repetition of phrases than it is to remember where the tone marks go in pinyin.  

The Curriculum Text so far is of no use to me at all, and appears to be in pinyin and simplified characters only (which is no good for someone trying to learn traditional characters).  You don't even really need it to proceed with the lessons, anyway.  

The speaking portion is not working out entirely well for me, personally.  You need a USB headset to record your voice in order to compare it to the native speaker's.  I have to speak at an unnaturally-loud level to record anything at all, and I have to speak with constant force in my voice or the program stops recording me.  I never get my reply to match the intensity of the speaker's, even with the microphone directly in front of my mouth and me speaking very loudly into it (just below shouting level).  This could be my problem, though.  Although I don't ever match the speaker's voice, it is good for practice to be able to hear the comparisons between my pronunciation and the speaker's.

I haven't needed to use customer support for anything so I can't comment on that and installation was easy.

I would describe my first semester of Chinese as intensely challenging and probably the hardest class I have ever taken in my life.  Like I said in the beginning, I am using Rosetta Stone to help me build on what I have learned already, and it has been great so far in that respect

I've used TurboTax for 3 years now! And again this year the software is the easiest way ever to do your taxes. Now I don't dread waiting till the last minute. I love to see the "Federal Tax Due" box get smaller and smaller. It is easy to download - no problems like some software. If you have the time to work on your own taxes then I suggest this program.

Adobe comes out and delivers another fine Acrobat product.  While I purchased this for the sole purpose of creating PDFs and forms we could email our customers, have them fill out, save and email back, the brief touches I've had with the automatic form generators have left me impressed.  The user interface is well thought out and clean which is a touchy subject for me personally as a programmer who specializes in UI design.  Everything is movable, hide-able and customizable in a new sharp looking set of toolbars that should feel right at home in Windows Vista.

But, while it's a fine product that loads quickly thanks to a pre-loader when Windows starts, it does suffer from it's share of problems.  The new user interface, while fancy, is glitchy, and has crashed out the software on more than one occasion.  Simple innocuous tasks such as dragging a form element into alignment can suddenly leave you staring dumbfounded at your desktop as Windows defends itself from some index out of bounds fault.  Is it entirely stable? No, but sadly, it's up to par with 99% of the industry's X.0 release software standards; which means it's 98% usable, but don't hand your boss an unpadded deadline that doesn't take into account a few crashes here and there.  

Finally, yes, while the price of RAM continues to decrease, the memory (and hard disk) footprint of software continues to increase to obscene levels.  Make sure your office equipment is on the more modern side because it'll take up 20meg+ of your RAM just when the computer starts; which is in this IT professional's opinion, a hefty price to pay just to look at PDFs in my web browser or on my hard drive without a 20 second load-up delay.   Load it up and create a PDF of a simple Word 2003 document that contains only a page of text, and task manager tells you it's now eating up 50 meg.  In short, it won't run well on the bargain-basement Intel Celeron, 256meg Windows XP machine.  

As a final note for those who aren't heavily into IT looking to buy this product for their small office, you need to be connected to the internet when this is installed and be absolutely sure you install it on the computer it's going to permanently reside on.  Like most expensive modern business software, Acrobat requires an activation in the name of Digital Rights Management that records it's serial number and the hardware ID of the computer it's installed on and keeps it on file at Adobe.  One copy of the software will let you install it on exactly one machine.  Try to install it on another machine (even if the original machine got obsoleted, kicked the bucket or transferred to different personnel), and you'll be met with a "this is already installed, please buy another copy" message.  DRM forces forethought in these modern times.  

Overall, it's excellent software, and for the faults I listed, I still give it 4 stars because it's an extremely solid product that'll work hard for you.  Expect the crashing issues to clear up as Adobe silently releases 8.0.1 and onward as free patches that will be downloaded automatically thanks to Adobe's built-in upgrade manager. While executives balked at the idea of office personnel with 1 gig of RAM in a common desktops a year ago, in reality, that's the working minimum these days for your office's power users who may have eight things open and/or running at once.  It's a $50 upgrade that to a power user, saves about 5 minutes of worktime on every hour of computer use.  Do the math and get them the tools they need because software like this won't be getting less bloated anytime soon.  

Finally, if all you're looking at is to create PDF files, there are many smaller, cheaper programs out there that can easily do the task.  You might want to hit up Google and investigate further.

This review might be alittle hard on the product but I wasnt impressed.  Expecting something revolutionary instead the lessons were kind of like going though High School again with one big exception.  They dont give you a writen translation of what every thing means.  Rossetta Stone focuses on pictures and the actual sounding out of words spoken.  In the program you are presented a picture and in Italian a narrator tells you what is going on or what the picture is.  However what he is saying is not directly translated in written words.  Its up to you to figure out what he is saying based on what you see in the pictures.  So pretty much you are not sure at times which words spoken are verbs or nouns.  They do their best to single out the verbs in which they give you multiple pictures of ppl performing the same actions.  However still its up to you to figure that out.  Other than that its a great program.  It forces you to pronounce italian with an italian accent using the pictures you see.  You are able to write italian sentences using the same technique (still no english translation).  I chose a language I already knew to try the program out.  If I was a true beginner...I might have a hard time learning this language and I would by far not be fluent in it.  Thats for sure

I chose Premier having used Deluxe in the past. Gave me a more indepth interview process in considering deductions and investment issues.

We tried to just dive in and do our dream house, but it takes a little more time to get into it.  But, once you do the tutorial, you can do almost anything.  I bought the product so we could see what our dream home would take.  We are almost too amateur for it. We probably didn't need to spend this much to be pleased, but it's worked great for us.

I purchased this to give to my mom for Mother's Day last year.  She's in the process of trying to figure out what to do with her backyard and I figured this would be an ideal tool for her to use in order to get a preview of her backyard.  She's fiddled around with it some, but has yet to upload photos of her backyard and really start messing around with it, but I suspect she'll get into it in due time

well when i first got this game, i didn't know what to do. but there is something called the tutorial where it helps you play the game. this really helped me.so when you get to the options menu, click on scenario and click on tutorial.and once you take care of 10 bunnies you go on to cats then you go on to something else.this game is a little confusing but fun

Good news: BitDefender found a dormant worm in a deleted email on our PCs that Norton Internet Security (NIS) 2007 missed.  Also, BD has very little impact on our systems or applications speed, which is why we uninstalled NIS - we had 8 months left on the Norton 3-PC license but our two older PCs (4 & 5 yrs old) had slowed down due to NIS so much that they were practically unusable.  The hourly BD updates are almost unnoticable.

Bad news: when we installed BD on the 2nd PC (2-PCs for 2-yrs license), we made the mistake of using my spouse's email and passwd instead of mine, which we had used on the 1st PC.  Bad move.  It had trouble starting, and modules were erratically turning on and off.  We logged into the BitDefender site and found that the same exact license was registered to two different accounts.  We uninstalled it, and reinstalled it using my email and passwd as a 2nd key, and that showed up on my account OK. However, there was no way to delete my spouse's account or key on their website.  Her copy still ran funky, but at least it started.

We used the online chat support and they were friendly and asked that we download two tools from their website and provide them sysinfo dumps by email.  We did the dumps and sent them as a reply to their follow-up email with the BD trouble ticket # in the Subject.  No reply after 3 days.  We sent two other queries, one with the ticket # and one without, both explaining that we needed her bad account and key deleted, as there was probably some server license issues going on that were hindering the operation on her PC.  Again, no response.

We wound up uninstalling her 2nd copy of my package, and buying a 2nd 2-PC for 2-yrs package.  At least those packages via Amazon were about $15 cheaper than a 1-PC for 1-yr CD version directly from SoftWin (BitDefender), so even with the dual CD purchase it is working out to only $16 per yr per PC (NIS was $35/yr/PC).  Since we installed her 2nd package using a different email and passwd, and an alias for her name, there doesn't seem to be any key conflicts causing her BitDefender to run whacky.

Sorry for the long-winded comments, but we wanted you to know that if everything goes great, the product is fast, low-resource impact, and finds stuff Norton misses.  BUT (big but), if you got a problem, you're on your own, pal!  Tech support is zip, nada, zed, zero.  Thankyouverymuch

I've had all the major antivirus programs at one time or another. 

BitDefender installed easily and I don't believe it's slowed down my computer  any more than any of the other programs I've used in the past.

It found a virus on my first scan after installating the program.

  When I first began downloading this program I did not know how I should install it or how much memory it used. I phoned tech support and picked this poor young man's brains. He answered every question I asked patiently and politely. He even walked me through some basic tools in the program. I am impressed!
  The software has hundreds upon hundreds of pre-made scrapbook pages for photos to be inserted, a heap of quality graphics, and these cute balloons you can add text to!! This is so easy to use that after 1 hour of playing with this I had printed half a dozen scrapbook pages! 
        PEOPLE.....THIS IS A QUALITY PRODUCT!!!

NERO 7 Ultra Edition is an extremely comprehensive suite of software. Unfortunately, most of the applications contained within are more than most people (including myself) will ever need. Perhaps, this suite should be broken into three or four different products and sold seperately. For example, they could easily sell a DVD authoring product, a CD authoring product, a back-up ultility and music/MP3 software.

Pros: When you figure out how to work the individual components of this suite (see cons), they work well and seamlessly. I like its ability to combine VOB files into one file and then export it into a variety of different formats using Nero Vision. Nero Recode works well if you have burned home movies onto a DVD+R DL disc and need to switch it onto a single-layer disc for family members who do not have DL technology. The utility for burning data CDs or DVDs (the classic Nero Burning ROM)is quick and painless. I don't use the other applications much, but you have to be careful that Nero doesn't make itself the default player for all types of media.

Cons: The website is poor and the instructions are difficult to follow if you can find them. The FAQ section is out of date and doesn't address the major questions that I had when trying to figure this software out (possible it is a language issue). There are not even user forums to discuss problems with the software like many other companies offer. The software update utility did not work for me and I was unable to use it for months and therefore was unable to fix a bug that occasionally lead to a fatal Windows XP error. If you can update to the newest version (instructions to follow), things work better. I never had any compatability problems with my drives that I have seen a lot of people complain about.

Fixes: If you are unable to update the software usning the update utility, the following worked for me:

1) Download the latest upgrade from [...]
2) Using control panel (add and remove programs), remove Nero from your computer.
3) Install the new upgrade from your hard drive. The installation program will detect your valid software serial number and install the new version of Nero 7 Ultra. Be careful that Nero doesn't make itself the default player for all media files during installation.
4) The new update utility works 1000x better than the old one and there should not be any problems. The new version of Nero 7 Ultra is far superior to the original version as well.

Of course, the instruction on the web site do not tell you that you have to uninstall the old version before installing the new version. It took a long time and a lot of frustration to figure it out.

Overall:
1) The software worked very well for me. It worked faster than other applications that I tried.
2) The web site is bad, at best. The documentation is bad, at best. The update utility included with this suite is non-functional, but the upgrade works very well.
3) I give this high marks on the software performance, but subtract for simply too many applications included and for the horrible customer support and bad web site.
4) Since I value functionality over customer support, I give this 4 stars (I would give 3.5, but that is not an option)

We purchased Nero in order to make voice recordings for other people.  The program has worked great.  It does what it says, it allows wonderful editing, so you can make sure what you record is clean.  We have also used it to record old cassettee tapes to CD.  The program automatically records the track making it an easy and smooth process.  We have been extremely happy with the low tech aspect, as we are not techy people.  Easy to use.  Does what it says it will do and a little more

I interviewed for a job and notice the office was Mac dominated.  I had always been reluctant to go with a mac so once I got offered the job I ordered this dvd to as to not be a total Mac dumb-donkey.  I watched the first few lessons and I was set, my first day of work went well thanks to the DVD.   The quality is the best and Tod the presenter is a gifted teacher, good voice, excellent overall.

I bought this about 6 months ago when I bought my first mac and also my first computer.I don't know why they aren't selling more of these things .For me ,looking at a manual the size of a phonebook is about as interesting as stocking shelves in a supermarket.This DVD rom is 8 hours long and covers all the items in the contents very well.Perhaps with a manual you can get into more detail but for me this is the place to start at least.What I do is watch a section and then either take a few notes and go to a particular program or just go to a particular program itself.By the way I do own a couple of manuals for Appleworks but they just collect dust

I really like the '07 version...now that I have gotten used to the infamous menu ribbon. At first it seemed like nothing was where it used to be (it's not!) and I had to hunt for everything, but now that I have been using it for a few days I believe this version is a great improvement over past Office suites. There is also the free PDF plug-in, that I have used many times already, that has you thinking what took Microsoft so long. There are many more great points as well, such as font preview which allows you to see what your text will look like just by hovering over the font name in the drop down menu, also an improved right-click short-cut menu. Outlook now has your calendar and to-do list on the right side of the screen and the ability to categorize things using color codes. Excel has a great new sort feature. My only complaint would be that Outlook does seem a bit slower now, but the benefits far outweigh the bad. Now if I could just convince my technology shy co-workers of this

This version of WP is as good as its predecessors, and the conversion programs are better. Make it your default app for Word docs.

There is only one problem I have come across so far. If you set Select mode to WP 9, it is still buggy; it takes some effort to select the text you want. You can always set the mode to the earlier version.

I recently had a water problem that leaked on to my dining room ceiling.  Knowing I would have to replace the ceiling, I took the opportunity to do some remodeling.  I purchased the Punch Interior product.  At first it was a little overwhelming, but after thumbing through the manual and reading some information on the Punch website I was able to quickly layout the the area of my room with the room designer.  I was able to use the designers pallet to select the colors that I wanted to use and place on the walls. Even cooler than that I was able to select Sherwin-Williams paint.  I walked right into the local store and matched the paint.  It couldn't get much easier than that.  There are also tutorials that you click on from the help menu that guide you in placing the materials.  I was able to add some digital photos of some artwork as well on the wall.  This has opened eyes to many other projects in my home.  With a little effort the program is easily manueverable, but if you get stuck there are many ways to get through to the finished product.

I resisted upgrading my 2004 version, especially after reading the reviews here. But the R4 release upgraded all by business, bank, and investment accounts without any problems.

For business, the accountants would rather you use Quickbooks,  but since mine is a simple service based business, I still refuse. Quicken works just fine and having everything in one place is just too valuable. 

It looks largely the same as 2004. But I was impressed by the online improvements, which is why the 2004 version is not longer supported. Now, it will automatically rename things the way you like. Since this eases the biggest problem of using software like Quicken, namely the discipline to enter and label everything, it a huge benefit. 

If you are looking to get control over your cashflow, and see the forest through the trees, this is the program. Learn it, know it, live it

I have been using Quicken since 2000 for my family accounting and my LLC biz accounting also. I updated my Quicken from ver2004 to ver2007. Costco had a much better price than Amazon for this software. The update process went smoothly. The ver2007 has a lot more reporting capabilities than the ver2004. The on-line update seems to be either on-the-par or a little slower than the ver2004. I tried the MS money deluxe back in mid -2006, but I just don't like the interface design from MS Money. So far, 2 months after the updating, I haven't run into any problem. Overall, I am happy with the ver2007 Quicken.

Following the tutorials, I was able to teach myself how to use the Quickbooks program.  It took me about five hours to figure it out and enter all my data.  Now I'm more organized, which in effect has increased my business performance.  I also like the financial reports that the program generates.

I know that most people simply do not backup their systems.  If they only knew how easy it was with a product like Norton Ghost.  This product not only backs up your files, it actually takes a snapshot of your system.  If your hard drive fails completely, you can boot off the CD and clone a new drive to the state it was when the last backup was done (actually called a recovery point).  Trust me, it works.  I have had a hard drive fail on me.  Another great feature is that you can also easily restore individual files from a specific recovery point.

Having previously used Norton Ghost 9.0 for backup, I was already a big fan.  But, version 10.0 is well worth the upgrade.  Improvements include having Norton Ghost manage the space used for backups, so you don't have to guess how many recovery points will fit on your backup drive.  And the biggest improvement of all - you can mount a recovery point as a mapped drive and copy files from previous backups, just like it was any other mapped drive.

I have not used the backup to CR-RW or DVD-RW, although the product supports it.  I would highly recommend getting an extra internal hard drive or external USB hard drive dedicated for backup with Norton Ghost.  I use this method and it works great

Once you decrypt the game entry point, Math Blaster is a brilliant method for teaching basic math functions (+,-,*, /). The problem with startup is the lack of guidance on how to start the game. A line or two (in the UI)explaining how to start the game (after the arithmetic tables are displayed) would be a tremendous assistance for beginners. We were disappointed with the list of +,-.*,/ tables displayed until we accidently clicked the entry point with the mouse. The user is presented an endless set of arithmetic expressions which the user must discern as valid/invalid while exploring a labyrinth of shoot-em-up and donkey-kong type choices. Perfect for a 6 year old 1st grade student

I found this to be a very good teaching tool to learn to play rock style music. I have never played the guitar before only the violin for eight years while in school. Now I am in my thirties and thought it would be too difficult to learn to play. I have been through the first four lessons and so far it is great. I can work at my own pace, repeat sections I find difficult and play actual songs with lyrics. It is great to play real music not just practice the chords and riffs (although practice is required, it is just more fun). Great piece of sofware. I combined this with a couple of books to study when not at the computer and this worked great for me. Great job eMedia. I look forwrard to additional eMedia song books for rock music

The NIV Rainbow Study Bible is an excellent product.  I must congratulate the author and his support team for such a wonderful and thorough job.  

I received this gift from my boss eleven years ago and still I am and will always be an avid reader/student of the Bible. It has been such a helpful tool in understanding the Bible that I have been giving it to my friends and family.  

I use the maps, diagrams, subject guide, concordance, and the analysis at the beginning of each book.  Most of all I just love the color coding with the different subjects like, Faith, Family, God etc; this makes study interesting and gives a "hands-on" insight into the inspired Word of God.

This NIV version is reader-friendly in a language that is easy to understand and follow along, as against the earlier versions, which made comprehension a bit challenging for me.  During my study I also compare NIV's contents and interpretations against another version and so far no content has been lost through the interpretation.  My one desire is have it in a smaller size so that I can carry it around wherever I go!

I would defintely recommend this product.

I found many improvements in overall manageability, but some have taken time to get used to. The application window that opens for some filters is too much for me. I do love the ease with which I can move from Photoshop to Painter as I use both.

Since Photography is my main reason for Photoshop, Bridge is great for working with RAW (once I figured it out), but as a browser for finding images I had to learn to adjust to it. The old browser was simpler to use. Sometimes I do not want it around in the background, and now I just close it out.  

For me Bridge was the biggest new addition. I like the rename feature, metadata, file info window, RAW adjustment.  The rest of Photoshop was a natural upgrade and was easy to move into.

It's not that Photoshop is so great at what it does, really. It's that everyone else's programs are so far behind it. Every release gets a little better. Even the cheaper Photoshop Elements release has the new Shadow/Highlight tool and several of the other great Photoshop feaures. I'd love to buy a photo editing program by someone else. There are plenty of things about Photoshop that occasionally annoy me. Color correction can be some kind of voodoo ritual, for instance. There's just nothing else out there worth considering as a replacement, though. So, uh...I guess I'm a loyal Adobe customer.

Everyman's Photoshop CS2 Review

The reason this is called an "everyman's" review is that I'm less than an expert. In fact, if Photoshop were a car, I'd be the one driving it cross-country in first gear. 

I normally use Photoshop for creating Web graphics or sexing up photos - no shifting required, in other words. But Photoshop does way more than that, so much so that without it, most designers would curl up and die. For most of us though, running a full-bore image-editing app is like driving a Ferrari in the back yard. I ought to know: I've had access to the software for a long time and still don't know what all the tools are for - the latest version, Adobe Photoshop CS2, has even more. That said, if you have any kind of visual project in mind and a modicum of talent, there's hardly anything you can't do. It may take a while to get rolling, but once you do, you'll kill for a chance to have your very own copy. See what you can do?



Photoshop CS2 is available alone or as part of the Adobe Creative Suite 2, which includes Adobe Illustrator CS2, Adobe InDesign CS2, Version Cue CS2, Adobe GoLive CS2, and Adobe Acrobat 7.0 Professional in the Premium Edition. (This reviewer was slated to receive the full suite, but "only" the Photoshop component showed up. Color me stupendously grateful regardless, of course, but I won't be addressing the integration features in this review.)

At $599 for the standalone version, piracy has always been a problem for Adobe, but the company has gone out of its way to save you from yourself by requiring activation -- not the same thing as registration -- within 30 days of installation. In the past, you could buy the app and install it on all your computers (or any machine for that matter), but the new version only works on the user's primary and secondary computers. Frankly, the details of the activation process left me confused. According to Adobe's activation FAQ page (my emphasis):

The activation process supports installation on two machines. The Adobe product license agreement allows the primary user to install the product on a primary computer and also on a home or laptop computer for his or her use, provided that the two copies are not used simultaneously. While the activation process supports installing and activating Adobe software on two machines, the usage of the product on the second computer is restricted to the user who licensed the software. Allowing others to use a second copy of the software violates the product license agreement.

Call me dense, but I have no idea what they mean by not using both copies simultaneously. Shortly before submitting this review, I had Photoshop CS2 running on both of my computers and nothing blew up, nor did anyone unpleasant bust down my door. And apparently my wife isn't allowed to use the software on the TiBook, according to the above. Frankly, this is absurd, and I wish the company's lawyers would get a life. But be that as it may, the installation process itself was straightforward, although my 500 MHz TiBook with OS X 10.3 (an oldie but a goodie) required a few hard slaps on the case above the CD-ROM drive before the disk would mount. And the first thing I learned when launching the new app was that as usual, I was coloring outside the lines:

Mac OS X version 10.3.4 or later is recommended for maximum performance and correct operation of Adobe Photoshop CS2. An earlier version of Mac OS X was detected. 

Oops! Despite the warning, the official system requirements listed in the reviewer's guide only call for a minimum of Mac OS X version 10.2.8, and I haven't seen any signs of "incorrect" operation yet. True, installing Photoshop on my 400 MHz Blue & White G3 with OS X 10.3 seems to have magically doubled the boot time, but that's it. If you don't have 10.3.4, I'd say go for it anyway. For those of you with older versions, there are more than enough useful new features in Photoshop CS2 to justify the $149.99 upgrade cost. A partial rundown includes the following, a few of which I'll expand upon later: 

* Adobe Bridge (the File Browser on steroids)
* Vanishing Point (an extraordinary plane-based visual perspective tool)
* Image Warp (turns flat images into shaped graphics)
* Reduce Noise filter (corrects JPEG compression artifacts and more)
* 32-bit High Dynamic Range (HDR) editing (creates images with the "widest possible dynamic range")
* Spot Healing Brush (one-click retouching)
* One-Click Red Eye tool
* Optical Lens Correction
* Animation (create animated GIFs directly in Photoshop)
* Smart Sharpen
* Enhanced 16-bit Filter Support
* Smart Objects (allow non-destructive scaling, rotation and warping of layers within Photoshop CS2)
* Multiple Layer Control (select, align, group and simultaneously move multiple layers)
* Multi-Image Camera Raw (um...)
* Video Preview (preview your work on a FireWire-connected monitor)
* WYSIWYG Font Menu (you're gonna love this)
* more color management options when printing
* all-new PDF engine (automatic optimization for Web viewing)
* High Capacity RAM Compatibility (can address 3.5 GB on a G5)
* expanded, integrated online services

See what I mean? 

As for Adobe Bridge, I probably shouldn't comment, since I've never used the old File Browser [blush]. But here's what Adobe has to say:

The acclaimed File Browser has evolved into its own application - Adobe Bridge. Now, the two applications work efficiently in parallel - Adobe Bridge building thumbnails while you edit in Photoshop CS2, or Photoshop CS2 batch processing images while you continue to work in Adobe Bridge. Adding essential new features for photographers such as multiple-file Camera Raw processing, enhanced ranking and labeling, and a slideshow mode for quick review of your images, Adobe Bridge also integrates with Illustrator CS2, InDesign CS2 and GoLive CS2, bridging the workflow across the new Creative Suite 2 applications. 

I don't know about File Browser, but Bridge rocks, and I'm converted. Instead of locating a particular image in the Finder using column view, in Bridge I can browse any folder on my hard drive, see all the photos at once (Filmstrip View, below, is a hoot), and open any or all of them in Photoshop with just a click. Just five minutes of playing with this opened my eyes, and when a skeptic like me gets all mushy, people should pay attention.



The Vanishing Point filter, completely new to CS2, rates a whole review all by itself. As Adobe explains it, "First you define the perspective in your image by creating perspective grids, then you edit your image normally, and let Vanishing Point take care of adjusting your editing to the defined perspective." What that means in real terms is that you can do things you never dreamed of without doing hours of work, like pasting "WAY COOL" and "YOW!" into the image below. (How did I do the "Hah!"? Keep reading...)



Talk about serious empowerment! I've never even tried to do work on this level, but now I can. Once you've defined the planes (grids) in your image, you can drag objects into the distance and have them still be in correct perspective. And since the perspective grids are saved inside the image (or on a separate layer if you want), you can return to re-edit whatever's been placed in them. Edit in perspective? Yup. You can paint directly onto perspective planes with the Stamp Tool, make selections within them, and a whole lot more. This is one extraordinary feature.

Add Image Warp to the mix, and your inner package designer will wake up hollering. Adobe has thoughtfully included a full set of presets for common object shapes, and you can drag control points on the warp grid to customize as desired. Ever wonder how your logo would look on a coffee mug or baseball cap? Image Warp has it covered. This is what I used to place the "Hah!" text inside the Mexican pot, of course, and remember, I don't know what I'm doing - so power users ought to be able to effect miracles.

* * *

There's a lot more to talk about, but we only have one Web site, and I'm sure my MyMac colleagues will have more to say about Photoshop and the other CS2 applications. Meanwhile, my other picks for things to be thankful for in the CS2 version are the ability to make animated GIFs right inside Photoshop, the Spot Healing Brush for removing unwanted pixels with a single click, multiple layer control, and the WYSIWYG Font Menu. Those of you who import vector graphics from Illustrator ( I don't ) will be able to start a whole new religion with Smart Objects, and photographers will love the new Camera Raw format editing power.

This is an incredibly powerful and versatile application. If I were Santa Claus or a benevolent deity, I'd make sure every artist and designer with half an ounce of talent had a copy to carry him- or herself to the Promised Land. It really is that good, although I have to say the complexity is overwhelming for beginners. (The Adobe Help application is the best I've ever seen, however, and provided tremendous assistance in writing this review.) I'd have no hesitation whatsoever in giving Photoshop CS2 the highest possible rating, except for an intuition that the app has grown to the point where its sheer size and multitude of features, not to mention the price, are bound to limit expansion of the user base. Personally, I'd like to take a digital carving knife to Photoshop and create about half a dozen specialty image editing apps, but that's not the direction Adobe is going, especially after absorbing Macromedia, and who's to say I know better than them? I also have no love for the increasingly maddening anti-piracy and copy protection measures employed by the industry, although Adobe's activation process gave me no trouble. It's the principle of the thing, and I'm just old-fashioned when it comes to trusting people.

But if you can get yourself a copy (legally!), this is the one to have, hands down. That's why hesitation aside, there isn't even a contest. I love it, and it's already indispensable, even for a first-gear user.

Mappoint is a great product but I don't understand why there aren't more city maps for Mexico included. This product is supposed to be for North America, to which Mexico belongs. Monterrey, Nuevo Leon and Mexico City were improved this time but it is very disappointing that the other major cities are still just shown as crossroads

Microsoft Works sometimes gets a bad rap. If you never used it, you may not know that includes a database, spreadsheet, word processor, and more. What's even better, is that the spreadsheet and word processor are compatible with Microsoft Office. So you can save files so that they can be opened in Microsoft Office AND you can open files that someone else sent to you if they were created in MS Word or Excel. This is perfect for the work I do for the humane society that I volunteer for as well as planning my daughter's girl scout troops activities and camping trips

I have been a Symantec customer for many years. Each year this product gets better and better. Has Norton Firewall, Norton Anti-Virus, automatic updates for viruses and worms, cleans up unneeded files, finds problems with your PC and fixes it for you.
You can even roll back your system to a certain date if a problem occurs and return to the date before the problem started. That is great!

I would not use any other product for this purpose.

Don't think it is overly clear that Norton Systemworks is NOT Windows Vista compatible despite the fact that it's a 2007 version.
For Vista, you'll have to use Norton Internet Security 2007, Norton AntiVirus or their upcoming Norton 360

I have used a few remotes with my PVR system but none as quite as nice as this one.  Most of the PC remotes I have used are either too large, clumsy or tiny and get lost easy.

This remote fits well in your hand, weighs enough to feel comfortable and has a very nice layout.  The large firefly button takes a bit to get used to.  I have hit this button a lot by accident bringing to life an unwanted application. Once you get used to the large button being there you can avoid it.  If you could change the function of this button to something useful like the application of your choice.. or perhaps the TV guide in SnapStream's Beyond TV product.

On the plus side -
Responsive
long battery life
built rugged
Great fit for your hand
small and compact without losing any functionality

On the negative side -
The big firefly button does not allow you to change its function to anything useful

This memory improvement software is marvelous. It helps you improve your memory providing you with motivating games that will let you keep one playing.

The only question you need to ask yourself before buying this software "Is English your mother language?"  as the most of the games are words games.. In fact, I loved the software although I'm not first language speaker. While playing, the words that are new to me disturbed me from getting high scores.

Highly Recommended for English first language speakers.. Looking forward to seeing this software in other languages.

It's the first time I used TaxCut after years of TurboTax. Didn't have any installation problems and even the data import from last year went fine. It's basically the same thing as TurboTax, but not as slick. I guess less computer-savvy users should go with TurboTax, because navigation and entries that are off the interview path are quite tough to figure out. Despite my overall preference for Intuit's product, how can you resist the difference in price including the e-file rebate and now the $10 special rebate for TaxCut?

I bought the full biz version and at first I just did the upgrade from XP which didn't turn out so good and the upgrade does not work correctly but then I did a fresh install and WOW!!! This OS rocks, not only is it similar to the Mac OS but for the first time it runs smooth. I installed iTunes and even the video runs smoothly with no delay. Also the new Vista mail is ten times better at catching spam and alerting you of fruad fishing mail with also a linked calendar built right in to the system that can alert you of events when the program is not even running. A+++ on this one MS, it can only get better from here... Thanks for such a great OS..

Family Tree Maker V. 16 is still a major software purchase for the family tree enthuiist. Simple to use, many printable reports and family tree outlines. You are able to record and save all your data and it is uploadable to online-family tree site in the GEDCOM format. I have used it for many years and will continue to do so. A must buy

I've been using the beta for a while now, so I know that I like Office 2007. PowerPoint 2007 is especially exciting and new; Word and Excel don't seem that different to me.

However, I just bought the full version and I COULDN'T OPEN IT! I felt stupid until I found out that I wasn't alone. Even with instructions that I found on the Web, I had to call Microsoft. There's a transparent label over the top that you need to remove before you can pull the red tab to open the box, but you can't remove the label without tearing the Certificate of Authenticity on top (which I might want if I ever sold it). In the end, I had to take the point of a scissors and squeeze it between the cracks on either side to slit the sides open.

Next, I put the CD in the drive and nothing happened. I've never knowingly turned off autorun (this is a Vista machine). I had to go into Windows Explorer and double-click setup.exe.

Finally, there are two disks, but no clue anywhere that I can find what the second one is for or what it contains. The installation instructions only mention one disk. 

It was a frustrating beginning

I do not understand people who do not have Antivirus, firewall, etc. software.  I am not saying you have to have Trend Micro's but if you're researching products, I can tell you that Trend Micro's works very well.  I used to use Norton religiously but had several viruses crop up undetected by Norton.  I have now had trend micro for 2 years and when I first installed it, it picked up some viruses that Norton didn't even detect.  The other difference I noticed right away was that the "footprint" on my system was extremely reduced.  Norton was a monster, slowing down my system.  Trend Micro works BETTER and does not hog resources.  I feel that the level of protection is also very good, I have had NO major problems since I switched to Trend Micro (I repeat, NO problems).  I shudder to think back to the problems I had with Norton

This is a renewal of one great software for me.  I boutht this software several years ago on the recommendation of Consumer's Report.  It is still, in my opinion, the best virus protection available.  I've tried both the other two big names and find this one much easier to use.  Funny thing is it is cheaper to buy a new software package than to renew through PC-Cillin.  I highly recommend this software and will use it until someone comes out with something this easy and good

This is a very nice product.  Chosing what you want to paint or change is very simple.  It installed easily and is quite simple to learn.

My dislikes are that you do not have the option of manually adjusting the color tone.  Many of the colors appear to be one color in the color selection panel but are much lighter when placed on the project.  It would be nice to be able to manually darken or bighten the color.  Because I was limited to the color selections they offer, I was not able to find the right color for my kitchen

Ok- I know that a lot of people say that they have a lot of problems installing Windows XP. First of all- the way that XP Handles Drivers is very different from 95,98,ME, and 2000. Many drivers do not work with XP, so it is important to contact your hadware manufacturer(s) to make sure that it is compatible. Older hardeware (ESPECIALLY LAPTOPS) may not have drivers that are compatible with XP. However, if you are building a new PC... I highly reccomend Windows XP Professional. Home edition is okay for a lot of things. But when you get into home networking and other advanced tasks, XP Pro is the way to go. I have had 2000 on my computer before this... and I always had problems. As soon as I upgraded to XP Pro, all problems went away. I also just built another computer... and XP Professional Works seamlessly with it. I am 100% satisfied with XP Pro

I have been using Readiris 11 for about two and a half months on a project I work on about 4 to 6 hours a day. The project is to put a book I wrote about 25 years ago that was typewritten but never published onto a CD as a course. So it involves using Readiris to read the pages into Word where I edit the work. The Readiris wizard (without tinkering which was a disaster) and pages with dark ink work best. If the pages are light because of typewriter ribbon age, I must first darken them in Photoshop and then print them out for Readiris. I found that Readiris does a wonderful job and is worth every penny

This software seems brilliant - does a very accurate job of scanning and decoding. It could be improved by allowing for multiple page scans (without having to set a timer for page insert)It will defintely save you time. IT does not appear to have an page storage/filing system like some ocr programs but 5 Stars for its scanning and decoding.

Registration becomes a problem if you have to reinstall the software several times (I redo my computer frequently), it is not smart enough to know it is the same machine and forces you to contact technical support. MS Office will recognise its the same machine so its not a hassle.

If you are interested in document storage and filing on the computer then other ocr might be a better choice. If you want ACCURATE page scanning for modification and changes I would MOST HIGHLY recommend this software.

This is probably the most stable and solid release of the
Corel graphics suite I've used.  It has all the features
necessary for illustration and photo editing, and at a price
far lower than competing products from Adobe.  Nice job,

I got iolo's message about 'save $20 on SM7' so I went for it.  Bad move.  SM7 downloaded ok, installed ok, ran ONCE ok, then I couldn't get it to open up again.  Then, about 30 seconds later, my computer shut itself off.  My computer was only 7 months old at the time.  I tried all my computer tricks about uninstalling, manually deleting files, system restore.  Forget it, I was licked...all the computer would do is bootup, then after running 60 seconds or so, shut down.  I had to do F10 and choose DESTRUCTIVE RECOVERY.  What a drag.  After spending the next day and a half re-installing all my programs it was ok.  I ran it that way for the next month and a half, then the computer got a bit slow and I put SM6 back in.  SM6 is running fine.  SM7 is junk

I have two Dell All In One Printers that I tried to install with this new software. I could not get the 942 to work because there are no new drives that Microsoft or Dell has created and they will not be available until 6/07. I tried to install the 924, but was not initially succesful. I contacted Dell support and they told me that a new driver was available. I installed it, but was only able to print. I cannot scan, copy or fax. I contacted Dell support and they told me that this driver will only let you print. I would have to wait until a new driver was created and they told me that it would be sometime. 
I have talked to friends that have Lexmark and HP printers and they are having the same difficulty.
If Mr. Gates and company want this product to work, they should have thought it out completely.

Anyone embarking on something as radical as a new OS shoould do some homework at least. I trialled the beta and followed through to RC1 which I have just replaced with the full product. I used the universally available hardware scan provided by MS to prove my platforms could work with the new driver structure. It is right to say that XP SP2 is worth keeping particularly in business environments for the short term. However long term Vista is going to be the farthest reaching success for MS. When the file system update rolls out it will be mind blowing. Gamers will argue for DOS support (Mickey take) but the rest of us will enjoy the eye candy and smooth flow of effort from keypad to scree

I just bought my 2nd copy of Outlook 2007. I really like the many more email color categories, and you can assign your own name tags to them too. Much easier to use, runs faster, better features. On the downside no documentation and MS online documentation is incomprehensible. I wound up spending an hour on the phone with MS support. If you are already running an earlier version of Office with Outlook, you must first go to add/remove programs and change   office to make Outlook un-available. Then and only then put in the disk and install. Do it any other way and you will be very sorry, all kinds of error msgs. and even your previous version of Outlook will no longer work. And yes it does import your msgs. and settings from your previous version. I run XP

Outlook 2007 did not carry all the fancy visual changes that other applications from the 2007 suite did (e.g. Word, Excel...), but the changes were quite awesome.
First, it now has a sidebar with your tasks, a calendar and TO DOs...
When you are on the calendar tab, you will notice a beter organization and, on the bottom, there will be the tasks due each day.
Integration with other calendar tools and online schedules is much better.
Also, it is much better integrated with Windows Mobile.

If you buy Office 2007 Home and Student, don't forget to buy at least one copy of this Outlook because it is not in there and it is necessary for synching your Windows Mobile device.

I purchased this program for my new Vista PC and I was quite pleased with the new and improved features, which integrates quite well on a Vista PC. As a previous owner of Outlook 2000 and Outlook 2002, I have become reliant on the program for both work and home. I elected to buy Outlook and Office Student and Home to maximize my dollar towards my Office purchase and I have no regrets. The Office Standard edition does not include One Note, which is one of those programs that integrates well with the new Outlook. In the end, I spent less and got more.
I would not recommend (nor do I intend) to upgrade my Office 2003 for my XP notebook. Likewise, I would not recommend purchasing Outlook without a complementary Office edition. If you have a new PC with Vista, it's a good idea to use Office 2007 in whatever fashion is most economical for your needs. If you don't use Office, there are tons of great e-mail programs that are available at no charge and an Outlook stand-alone purchase makes little sense. I think Thunderbird/Firefox is a sound choice for the non-Office user.

e media has made this simple and easy to understand and use. Depending on playing level it can be too easy. However, as a beginning guitar play I learned and implimented 8 chords in the 1st hour or so. The system worked flawlessly. i would recommend this system to anyone starting to play. If you have a good understanding of your chord then maybe skip this one and go on to the next

I've played in the past but had been quite awhile, this product is excellent.  Takes you step by step but quickly progresses.  Really like the application, can play along, show's you cords (or hides them - your choice), records, etc.

I plan on buying the intermediate level once I've completed the beginner

I'm not sure what software the other reviewer was using, but I've been using Office Accounting since the 2006 release and I love it.  I upgraded my old 2006 file to 2007 with ease.  I have been running it on a Core2 Duo machine with no issues.  No crashing, etc.  I used this software under Windows XP as well as Windows Vista Business.  My only reason for the 4 stars is that the Online Banking features don't work like Microsoft Money does.  My bank only allows Money/Quicken to connect directly, or I'm able to download an Excel sheet with my data.  Office Accounting lists my bank, but tells me I need to download my data from my bank instead of it automatically doing it.  I bit strange since Money handles this with no problem.  Anyway, it's great software for the price..

A lot of brain flexing while enjoying the program's great graphics.  I give the makers of this game a thumbs up for coming up with it.  My son's use of it has sharpened his learning skills - without him knowing it.  He just enjoys the games and funny (and safe) animation.  A parent or older sibling will have to be there to help them understand some concepts, but as soon as they learn the game at level 1, it's easy to jump to 2nd then the 3rd level.  Then again, this will depend on the child's age, learning ability, and the time spent on the computer.  An hour with a bit of relaxing in between would be suggested when working in front of the computer to rest the eyes.

If you love MS Paint but hate Photoshop don't buy this software. Cakewalk is not for people who want the software to do everything for them. This software replaced all my music gear and an old $250 version of Cakewalk. I now do not have to pull out my synth modules, drum machine, and digital recorder anymore. This does it all. I am totally blown away by what you get and the price you get it for. Yes, I am old school. I do actually create and modify the music. I do know what midi is and how it works. I did spend a little time learning the software. This software is not for wimps. It needs to be learned and it is not that difficult.

The only thing I need to let you know that the internal synths do not sync with external but that was expected. There is a time lag between internal and external; realize that the computer has to do more math for the internal to work. No big deal. Just use the internal or nudge the track to make it sync.

I purchased this software about 2 weeks ago, and I have to say that it is far superior to any other product in its price range.  I will admit that it's not nearly as intuitive as they say it is, but the learning curve (to me) isn't that steep.  I say that with some reservations, because I went to school for media production and probably have a little better knowledge base to work from than the average beginner.  To make matters more difficult, Cakewalk products have (from my experience) always had very poorly written manuals.  With Music Creator, they seem to have made an effort to improve in that area.  It's the first Cakewalk manual I've seen that actually has screenshots of whatever the particular topic is.  Thank heaven for small favors.  

To avoid experiences like the other reviewers apparently had, I would recommend the following

1. Buy the boxed version instead of the download from the website.  Yes, it's ten bucks more and you have to pay for shipping, but with the boxed version, you do get a manual (with pictures, no less) as well as a separate CD of video tutorials, plus some other extras.  Do the CD tutorials first.  If you get stuck after that, the info in the Help section makes alot more sense.   

2. If you don't have a background in recording, get yourself a home recording how-to book.  There's millions of them out there, and they can be extremely useful if you don't really have an understanding of the jargon.  One thing about Cakewalk is that they say you don't have to have any experience to use their products, but somehow they assume that you're familiar with the terminology.

If you're just looking for some backing tracks to jam along with, or drag and drop MIDI sequencing, this will do the job, but is probably alot more than you need.  If you're like me and are looking for an all-in-one solution that can take a song from the melody knocking around in your head to a finished, mastered product on CD or MP3 (and you don't have the cash for ProTools or Reason) this might be just what you're looking for.

If you are still running a machine with 98 or ME, this could be your last upgrade for that machine to get a little more use out of it before having to break down and buy a new machine capable of running Vista. It drastically cut the down time due to the blue screen errors on 98 and ME

As previous reviewers have mentioned, you should make sure your hardware and software is XP compatible before you buy. Assuming everything is compatible Windows XP upgrade is a breeze to install, once installed it is very funtional and stable. The main irritation about previous Windows operating systems was the instability. My Windows XP installation has not crashed a single time since I installed 768 MB of Ram. For a stable system it is very important that you have enough Ram. When I only had 256 MB of ram installed the system was not much more stable than Windows 98 SE. I am very pleased with Windows XP, you will be too, if you have enough Ram, and XP Compatible software and hardware.

Please don't buy the WinXP upgrade because for one thing I had to renstall it 5 to maybe 6 times and when you do that your harddrive will make sounds. It might make a click sound. I would reccomend the full version of XP. It's so much better!

The interaction and learning activities are easy to use and help you to pick up the language very quickly.  I make several trips into Hispanic countries on Mission with our church and this helps me learn the things I need to communicate on a better level.

Take it easy, get comfortable, the lessons repeat themselves and after a few hours you are amazed at how much you retain. Was sceptical at first, but the next afternoon when I was telling a friend which words I had learned, we were shocked at how much I had retained . It's easy, it's repetative, it's making me wish I had oredered all 3 levels at once. My oldest child is now takng spanish in high school, so I will order her all 3 levels. We can let her sisters use it to get a jump on spanish as well.They start spanish class in two years. This has been a good investment, as a contractor overseas working, it has paid off for the price paid and the time spent learning. Shows respect for others when you can learn their language to communicate with them.

I started using this program so that I can learn German.  I live in a Dutch speaking home and Dutch was my first language.  Since the two languages are very similar I decided to begin learning German. The program is very good, although translations would be helpful, and if the grammar was explained. Also it would be nice if they introduced the definite articles with each noun introduced in the vocabulary, this would make it much easier instead of having to eventually figure out the noun gender.  But all in all this program is quite good to learn basic German, move on to the second version of this program to learn more advanced things

I don't like to find time to review stuff like this, though all the Vista bashing is making me sick, so I feel its needed. I received Vista for free, through my engineering department of my university. If your in college check your technology website. Most universities provide lots of free software. However this is one OS I would gladly pay for. I installed the 64-bit edition of Windows Vista about 3 days ago. I can honestly say, that I have not had one driver or program compatibility issue as of yet. Of course I verified all my drivers were available for the 64-bit edition before I installed vista. Vista is very, very stable. I have not had a single problem yet. The OS surpassed my expectations, which were kind of low from all the Vista-Bashing I have read. The OS looks absolutely beautiful. Despite higher system requirements I see no slow down in terms of speed. I absolutely love the sidebar, which allows me to view my stocks, news, and weather while my computer is connected to the internet. Everything looks better to me, from control panel to the start menu. NOT A SINGLE COMPATIBILITY PROBLEM TO REPORT WITH THE 64-BIT EDITION.

This new OS is interesting.  There are some features that "get in the way" as I hate having to verify everything I just told the computer to do.  However, it is a nice upgrade as far as security and speed goes.  Keep in mind that the hardware requirements listed are minimum requirements and Vista will operate much better on a newer machine with a faster processor, more RAM and higher end video card.  It is a much faster OS than XP, but the changes require some getting used to.  I would recommend holding off on upgrading at this time as there are a lot of programs that will not run on Vista as yet and even some that do are having issues with MS updates causing problems.  Roxio Media Suite 9 is Vista compliant, but Vista pops a warning and shuts down a driver on system boot that is related to the Roxio software.  Rhapsody doesn't work properly with it

no problems yet so far and with its better features, most definately worth it.  for a few extra bucks very much worth the upgrade from vista home to home premium.  go with this product if your looking for something with enhanced security and more applications.  only problem is have a bigger harddrive because this does take up a lot of space.  other than that, does a heck lot more than xp in some ways but not a whole lot of changes

I'm a freelance writer and reviewer so I do quite a bit of typing.  I've had carpal tunnel for years but it has gotten progressively worse. When I saw Dragon Naturally Speaking 8 at the store I thought I would give it a try, especially since it was very affordable.

This is my first review done entirely by vocal dictation.  (As I'm speaking, it's writing down my words IN this review box!) It took me less than an hour to get this program up and running, and the program responds remarkably fast.  The accuracy on some words is sometimes hit and miss, though.  For example for "hit and miss" in the previous sentence, it wrote "hidden menace".  However, there is an Accuracy Tool included which checks audio settings, perform additional training (reading information into the microphone), add words from your documents to the vocabulary, and more. I haven't used this tool yet, though. As I said, I'm less than one hour into testing this and it's performing great!

If you're used to speaking fast and loose you may have to adjust your speaking style when using this tool, enunciating very clearly.  During the training session they recommend speaking like a news broadcast, for example. But you don't need to speak word for word very slowly...normal speech is fine.

I find the headset comfortable and I'm amazed at the responsiveness of this tool.  I expected it to take longer to learn and use.

If you have a limited use of your hands or have carpal tunnel syndrome, I highly recommend Dragon Naturally Speaking 8.  All it takes is installing the CD-ROM, plugging in the headset to the speakers and doing a vocal test to adjust microphone levels.  

I'm excited to use this product, which will no doubt make life easier for both me and my hands! I love it that I can use this tool for Word Documents, emails, and website use!

I agree this is really dumb.  What's the point?  The original CD's may be backed up (thank God), so it's useless as an anti-theft device.  I am a Mac user, and I have messed around with using disk images to replace the CD, but without success.  Apparently they only permit direct hardware calls to the CD drive.  May check with some gurus to see if there is a workaround.

Basically a good product, but with just enough dumb, annoying flaws (and over priced) to prevent five stars

After trying several game engines, in the "affordable" class, DarkBasicPro is the only one without high end limitations.  As another reviewer said, it is a wrapper for DirectX.  This means you have all the capabilities of DirectX, without the complexities, including shaders, sound, media, collision detection, packaging, etc.  And it gives a good frame rate!  The package has matured within the last year, and many of the earlier defects have been corrected.  (The manual still leaves room for improvement. Buy the Dark Basic book also, and you will be happier!)
Dark Basic Pro now requires DirectX 9.0.  And for really fast action games, you will need a reasonably powerful PC.  If you find any command limitations, (even though it has over a thousand commands), you can always write your own DLL, and add capabilities, such as Octrees to the engine (which they don't have yet.)  There now are several third party add-ons, such as "TreeMagik G2" and other enhancement packs which greatly aid in game construction.  Check out the Game Creators web site, and the forums!
There are other game engines which are simpler, and "spoon feed" the process to you.  But once you get a little experience, you will be frustrated by the limitations caused by the watered down interface.  Dark Basic Pro is not that much more difficult to use, and is tremendously more powerful and flexible.

I went from a failing 120GB drive  with 60 GB used, to a USB 80GB drive, then back to a new 120GB drive.  You need to have a CD drive to boot from.  It was fairly intuitive to use...  had to think about a couple of options, but got it right the first time I used it.  It copied everything...  programs, Windows, Desktop,  E mails, favorites, even cookies.
Acronis even lets you download a trial version for free with two weeks time limit.  Their on line download price was more than I got it on Amazon, and I got the box and disk from Amazon.

I had a problem where my hard drive was failing and the manufacturer was sending a new blank hard drive.  I could either spend the next few weeks trying to replace the system, programs, settings, and files, or I could ghost the entire hard drive.  True Image was easy to download and install (1st try).  It made a mirror image of my hard drive to my USB-connect external drive in about 45 minutes and then was able to verify the back-up.  There was also an easy guide to make a start-up disk on CD.  When the new drive arrived, I replaced it and then True Image took care of the rest.  In about 2 hours I was up and running again and didn't miss a single thing.

The 7.0 was the pits for activation.  And it doesn't work with the Vista at all.  I contacted Adobe so many times to try to get the 7.0 to work and finally uninstalled it.  I am hoping that the 8.0 will work with the Vista.  Apparently Adobe website says they have a patch for it.  I have used Acrobat for 7 years and love the product.  Great for web work

I found Taxcut to work very well and was easy to follow. It's hard to bet it at under 9 bucks! I didn't buy the state version because the Michigan state tax form is pretty much a no brainer to fill out since you get very few deductions and once you have your AGI all you have to do is calculate the tax due. I mainly needed a tax program that would figure out if any AMT  was due. The IRS paperwork for the AMT is confusing to me and I wanted a program that would do the work for me. 

 I saw some other posts about people having problems installing taxcut and having it lock up at 21%. On the Taxcut website they talk about not having a certain font package on your computer will cause the lock up. Therefore, I downloaded and installed the font package first. Then I installed Taxcut and away I went. I ran the update manager first which took some time at my painfully slow 28.8 connection, but got through it in about a half hour. 

The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is that there are too many commercials for H&R block services and the donations portion was weak because it limited the amount of donation spaces to log in your donations. Therefore, I had to group the donation which was a little bit of a pain and because it thought the donations needed a special form because it exceeded some limits. And for some reason it wanted to know if they donations were post 9/27. This became a slight problem with grouping the donations. 

On the positive side I did like the way it logged in any capital gains for stocks or mutual funds.  

All that said I was able to do my taxes on a Sunday afternoon rather than over the entire week.

I just upgraded my Webster software to this version for WinXP.  It's ok and does the job it's intended to perform. But I liked the previous versions that displayed both the definitions and the thesaurus in parallel panels. Just a matter of display preference, so it's not that important to every user.

Any e-dictionary will give you definitions of course, but what I especially like about this one is that it is lightning fast. Also, when a definition contains an illustration it's indicated by an icon which you double click to view (and which comes up instanteously in a seperate window). This dictionary also allows you to search a word by different criteria other than for just its definitions: rhymes with, Homophones are, Date of, Author quoted, Definition contains...etc, etc. One note on installation: make sure you temporarily disable active virus software (and it wouldn't hurt to do the same for those other programs on the right side of the task bar)

A great product.  Make sure you get a separate instruction manual.  The one that is included is not enough.  Make sure you do the tutorial before you start your own website.  This was a relatively easy program to follow and allowed my, a person that is not real computer savvy, to create a wonderful and usable website.  The pictures help greatly in the understanding of the program.  Also, items to be cautious of, or areas of help are pointed out in the margins.  I read the manual thorougly before starting.
