This product is great! Very refreshing. It tastes just like you are drinking it straight from a young coconut.  It doesn't have any added sugar & it's only 60 calories a serving.  I just wish it were cheaper...

If you have ever had trouble with leg cramps, be sure to  drink Zico. It will relieve your cramps almost instantly probably because it is so high in potassium. I have recommended it to others and it always works. Pat Rampolla

I personally like the taste of this product, but I can see that others may not. The taste is unusual, with natural tones.

I definitely like the packaging. Standard aluminum cans often start to look pretty bad from rubbing on each other for a long time, but a box of Zico survived a 2-week road trip that included some nasty dirt roads just fine.

I found this product in the store and the packaging caught my attention.  I love everything it has to offer.  I tried one sip and I fell in love.  It quenches your thirst much better than water and has a subtle, appealing taste.  I can't believe anyone could complain about the taste.  

I live with chronic pain and there are days that I can't get out of bed and I drink and eat nothing all day.  I now have this product to enjoy along with the benefits it offers.  I am addicted and plan to always have this product on hand.

Ignore the review below me as she is incorrect. 

Coconut water is simply the liquid taken from the center of young coconuts. Their is no "chemical wizardry" all you need is a knife and a straw. 

As coconuts mature this water is absorbed into the flesh. When this  coconut flesh is ground and strained, coconut milk is produced,  the liquid of pina coladas.

These drinks are quite good if you enjoy coconut water

I've been wanting to try Spirulina, the superfood that everyone in the health world swears by, and figured this would be as good an opportunity as any to do so. The bar is a medium sized green rectangle. It smells interesting and is very moist and chewy. I'm not a big fan of sour foods, so I didn't like that it tasted a bit sour. My [...] brother however LOVED this bar more than all the others we tried. Has a lot of cashew and is very sweet and packed with good fats. VERY FILLING! Overall if you like sour and sweet, this bar is for you

This is a great granola that is both nutritious and delicious. Although it is called "Cranberry Pecan," I find the pecan taste to predominate in the mix, while the cranberries are quite chewy and weaker than in some other cereals. 

This is a traditional cereal, and is a great way to start the day. It is relatively high in calories, but appropriate for breakfast in suggested quantities. The texture is very crunchy, and while I prefer the Bear Naked texture which is softer, this is still a wonderful product.

In the six-pack the cereal is very reasonably priced, and given the quality of the product is an excellent value. I recommend this cereal to anyone, and especially to people who love pecans

This granola is very good - it's very chewy.... and takes a long time to chew - the dried cranberries are very chewy. I think it would taste great on a salad or mixed in with other cereal. I wonder if cooking it like hot oatmeal would soften it.

While I'm quite impressed with the health claims for these nibs, frankly they taste like dirt!  (Or what I imagine dirt would taste like.)  

I don't understand how one reviewer got the nibs to melt.  When I tried it, I got hot dirt.  I finally settled on grinding them fine, mixing them with peanut butter, sweetener, regular cocoa powder and a little milk.

It's not bad -- but maybe next, I'll just get some really dark chocolate.  Life's a little short to be eating dirt.

Ever since having my little girl five years ago, I have been dedicated to serving her wholesome, nutritious and natural foods. This can be a difficult task in today's world, with so many processed, nutritionless foods, filled with harmful perservatives and trans fat. I didn't want to deny my daughter "snacks", but I hated the idea of giving her foods filled with chemicals and hydrogenated oils. So it is no surprise that I was thrilled when I stumbled on Annie's Homegrown products. Here is a brand that I can serve to my child without guilt. All of their products are made with a small handful of natural ingredients that we all can recognize (and pronounce!). No partially hydrogenated oils, no preservatives, no ungodly amounts of sodium. And they are delicious to boot! My daughter goes crazy for these little cheddar bunnies! They are  perfectly cheesy and not too salty and their cute shape appeals to little ones. This is a company that cares about what you feed your children and yourself. And that is a company I am happy to support.

Natural Cheese Crackers - Great for Snack Mixes

"...made without hydrogenated oils - which is a good thing since it's difficult for our bodies to absorb trans-fatty acids that come from hydrogenated oils." ~box

These are definitely natural snack crackers to bounce around about. I mean, it is so rare to find even natural foods without hydrogenated oils. I can't count the times I've read labels only to be disappointed to find that "natural" does not always mean healthy. 

Ingredients: Certified organic wheat flour, expeller pressed safflower oil, aged cheddar cheese (contains milk, salt, enzymes, cheese culture), salt, yeast extract, paprika, annatto extract (for color), ground celery seed, onion powder, yeast.

I've made my own cheese crackers and these really do taste homemade. About 24 tiny crackers will satisfy any cheese cracker craving and that is about 70 calories. 

These crackers are Bernie the Bunny (Annie's beloved mascot) approved. They are also made with only vegetarian ingredients. I love the cute rabbit shape and you can add these crackers into snack mixes with pumpkin seeds, chocolate chips, dried cranberries, GeniSoy Soy Nuts and anything else you can think of including sunflower seeds.

I personally like the taste of this product, but I can see that others may not. The taste is unusual, with natural tones.

I definitely like the packaging. Standard aluminum cans often start to look pretty bad from rubbing on each other for a long time, but a box of Zico survived a 2-week road trip that included some nasty dirt roads just fine.

I found this product in the store and the packaging caught my attention.  I love everything it has to offer.  I tried one sip and I fell in love.  It quenches your thirst much better than water and has a subtle, appealing taste.  I can't believe anyone could complain about the taste.  

I live with chronic pain and there are days that I can't get out of bed and I drink and eat nothing all day.  I now have this product to enjoy along with the benefits it offers.  I am addicted and plan to always have this product on hand.

I first purchased Bear Naked Low-Sugar granola from a brick/mortar grocery store...for $4.59 for the 12-ounce bag.  I loved it, and keep it in my office at work to incorporate into any flavor of yogurt or to satisfy those late afternoon munchies.  It's nutritious, delicious, and wholesome.  The Amazon price is an absolute steal for this product -- over $1 less per bag than you might pay at a store down the street!

Having tried Bear Naked's other products, I can also assure you that you are not sacrificing flavor or texture by choosing the low-sugar option.

Guess what I'm eating right now?

You guessed it...Bear Naked Banana Nut Granola!

I was in the organic section of a grocery store the other night, looking for low-fat granola. (I'm on a low-fat diet to help combat elevated cholesterol and triglycerides. *wince*)

I bought myself a 12 oz. packages of the Banana Nut, as well as the Bear Naked Peak Protein Granola. The latter was so-so, but the Banana Nut? YUM!

It's delicious plain, in my opinion, but you could certainly eat it with milk/soy milk as cereal, or mix in with some yogurt. 

There are 11 servings per bag (about 1/4 cup) and here are some nutritional facts per 1/4 Cup:

140 calories (60 from fat)
Total Fat 7 g (10% DV) 
NO Trans Fat
NO Cholesterol
5 mg sodium
17 g carbs (3 g dietary fiber, 5 g sugars)
3 g protein

If you love organic, hand-made, nutritional products, Bear Naked Banana Nut is wonderful! It contains almonds, and tastes a bit like dried banana chips + tasty granola.

(P.S. The price here at Amazon is a STEAL! I would have paid over $10 more if I would have bought the same quantities at the grocery store!

I have to say that this 100-count box is a great deal for your money.  Although this isn't a "full size" Slim Jim but rather a shorter one, it's the perfect size for a lunch box surprise or a mid-afternoon pick-me-up.  Slim Jim has managed, after all these years, to still provide the same taste of slightly spicy/slightly salty goodness, and you won't go wrong with the 100-count box.

There is a reason that Slim Jim doesn't ever quite say what it is.  It isn't a beef stick.  It isn't jerky.  It is what it is.  I remember eating them when they first came out and wondering what they were.  Now, tasting them again, I remember the question.  There is some kind of meat in there, but it is treated in a lot of different ways.  A Slim Jim is still as greasy as I remember, as well.  The trick is to enjoy them without eating them to excess.  For what they are, they are convenient, tasty, and can be fun.

While on the computer, in your car, at work or just want a tasty snack, Slim Jim is the perfect treat!  Not big enough to ruin an appetite for meals, it is just the right size to curb hunger...and tastes great!    The size of the Slim Jim in the 100 count box fits anywhere - pocket, purse, glove compartment...so you can have a snack anytime.  Enjoy

When I was a kid I ate slim jims all the time. 

I am glad that they still taste the same. 
Unfortunately, nowadays they like to change and mess with too many of the things that we grew up with and loved as children.

Here's what I used to do (and still do): I get the end real wet until the skin gets to the point that you can slough it off without breaking it. I eat the skin and then I slowly chomp the stick until it's all gone. Then I grab another and do it all over again!

And I don't care how many of these you'll try to eat in a week -- a box of 100 is guaranteed to last a long time! This is a good buy!

I recommend the good ol' slim jim!

Excellent. One of the few food items I've found on here that I think I'll buy again. Remember that it's best chilled/ice cold, if you're ever gonna sample it. Not so good when not so cold, great when actually cold. Very refreshing feel either way, though, after you've had a drink

This is unlike any other "bar" I've tried. I like that it's gooey & green--I'm tired of the drier oat-like bars. It's satisfying & tasty.  May not be for everyone, though.  I only wish more ingredient percentages would be listed on the Amazon descriptions--most of these things are pretty high fat.  Ok for a meal on the run

This is a great granola that is both nutritious and delicious. Although it is called "Cranberry Pecan," I find the pecan taste to predominate in the mix, while the cranberries are quite chewy and weaker than in some other cereals. 

This is a traditional cereal, and is a great way to start the day. It is relatively high in calories, but appropriate for breakfast in suggested quantities. The texture is very crunchy, and while I prefer the Bear Naked texture which is softer, this is still a wonderful product.

In the six-pack the cereal is very reasonably priced, and given the quality of the product is an excellent value. I recommend this cereal to anyone, and especially to people who love pecans

Absolutely scrumptious granola that is good for you...low fat, high fiber, a delicious alternative to the bland, tasteless granolas produced by the major American cereal makers.  I've tried virtually all of the Back to Nature products and each and every one is sensational. Do yourself a favor and try this product. Highly recommended

This granola is very good - it's very chewy.... and takes a long time to chew - the dried cranberries are very chewy. I think it would taste great on a salad or mixed in with other cereal. I wonder if cooking it like hot oatmeal would soften it.

Back to Nature Apple Strawberry Granola are an excellent product for a healthy breakfast or snack. Each flavor of the Back to Nature Granola is tasty.

I would be careful before ordering this product in bulk. My order of 6 bags came in this week and they are due to expire on September 15th. I did not realize before ordering that this product was getting ready to expire and would not have placed the order had I known this. As this is a food product it is not eligible for return.

So while this is an excellent product, I would not recommend ordering this from Amazon Grocery unless you are prepared to have a bulk order of food that is getting ready to expire

I have been using the Navitas Natural Organic Raw Cacao Nibs for four months now and it gives me a feeling of happiness, well being and energy for the day. We add it to our fruit smoothie in the morning. I don't eat chocolate with dairy and sugar as it gives me pimples. However I can tolerate the nibs.

While I'm quite impressed with the health claims for these nibs, frankly they taste like dirt!  (Or what I imagine dirt would taste like.)  

I don't understand how one reviewer got the nibs to melt.  When I tried it, I got hot dirt.  I finally settled on grinding them fine, mixing them with peanut butter, sweetener, regular cocoa powder and a little milk.

It's not bad -- but maybe next, I'll just get some really dark chocolate.  Life's a little short to be eating dirt.

These little nibs are very bitter.  I wouldn't recomend poppin them straight from the bag.  They were fabulous melted in a pan with some sweetner, dip with chunked fruit, lay on tray covered with wax paper, and refridgerate for 20 min.  The chocolate hardens.  Raspberries are my families' favorite but any fruit works!  Also, very good sprinkled in warm milk for a homemade hot chocolate.  This is a great product for experimental food people.  Straight out of the bag... disappointing

Ever since having my little girl five years ago, I have been dedicated to serving her wholesome, nutritious and natural foods. This can be a difficult task in today's world, with so many processed, nutritionless foods, filled with harmful perservatives and trans fat. I didn't want to deny my daughter "snacks", but I hated the idea of giving her foods filled with chemicals and hydrogenated oils. So it is no surprise that I was thrilled when I stumbled on Annie's Homegrown products. Here is a brand that I can serve to my child without guilt. All of their products are made with a small handful of natural ingredients that we all can recognize (and pronounce!). No partially hydrogenated oils, no preservatives, no ungodly amounts of sodium. And they are delicious to boot! My daughter goes crazy for these little cheddar bunnies! They are  perfectly cheesy and not too salty and their cute shape appeals to little ones. This is a company that cares about what you feed your children and yourself. And that is a company I am happy to support.

Natural Cheese Crackers - Great for Snack Mixes

"...made without hydrogenated oils - which is a good thing since it's difficult for our bodies to absorb trans-fatty acids that come from hydrogenated oils." ~box

These are definitely natural snack crackers to bounce around about. I mean, it is so rare to find even natural foods without hydrogenated oils. I can't count the times I've read labels only to be disappointed to find that "natural" does not always mean healthy. 

Ingredients: Certified organic wheat flour, expeller pressed safflower oil, aged cheddar cheese (contains milk, salt, enzymes, cheese culture), salt, yeast extract, paprika, annatto extract (for color), ground celery seed, onion powder, yeast.

I've made my own cheese crackers and these really do taste homemade. About 24 tiny crackers will satisfy any cheese cracker craving and that is about 70 calories. 

These crackers are Bernie the Bunny (Annie's beloved mascot) approved. They are also made with only vegetarian ingredients. I love the cute rabbit shape and you can add these crackers into snack mixes with pumpkin seeds, chocolate chips, dried cranberries, GeniSoy Soy Nuts and anything else you can think of including sunflower seeds.

If you dont like mangos, you will not like this drink. It does not taste like an "organic" mango, but rather, it tastes more like the "essence of mango" you would smell from an air freshener. This does mix pretty well with cold rum.

I would suggest you find this brand locally to try it before you buy it. This water does not taste like the water you would get from the Asian countries. I cant really explain why either

Excellent. One of the few food items I've found on here that I think I'll buy again. Remember that it's best chilled/ice cold, if you're ever gonna sample it. Not so good when not so cold, great when actually cold. Very refreshing feel either way, though, after you've had a drink

If you have ever had trouble with leg cramps, be sure to  drink Zico. It will relieve your cramps almost instantly probably because it is so high in potassium. I have recommended it to others and it always works. Pat Rampolla

I personally like the taste of this product, but I can see that others may not. The taste is unusual, with natural tones.

I definitely like the packaging. Standard aluminum cans often start to look pretty bad from rubbing on each other for a long time, but a box of Zico survived a 2-week road trip that included some nasty dirt roads just fine.

Bear Naked is my favorite granola and Fruit and Nut is by far my favorite flavor.  I came across Bear Naked because one of my favorite breakfast's is granola mixed with banana and yogurt.  When I went off of refined sugar I was having the hardest time finding a granola without sugar added.  Bear Naked uses all natural sugars like pear juice and maple syrup.  My favorite part of this flavor is the dried cranberries and the coconut, plus the almonds add crunch to an overall chewy texture.  I recommend this brand to all lovers of granola and to anyone looking for a healthy treat

Bear Naked Granola is just fabulous. I've tried every granola around, and Bear Naked strikes the right balance between crunchy, sweet, and ostensibly, good for you. And Amazon's price certainly beats what you'd pay at the store.

This is a great tasting granola.  It is good as a cereal or as a snack.  I can save money when I buy the box at Amazon instead of at the grocery store.

I first purchased Bear Naked Low-Sugar granola from a brick/mortar grocery store...for $4.59 for the 12-ounce bag.  I loved it, and keep it in my office at work to incorporate into any flavor of yogurt or to satisfy those late afternoon munchies.  It's nutritious, delicious, and wholesome.  The Amazon price is an absolute steal for this product -- over $1 less per bag than you might pay at a store down the street!

Having tried Bear Naked's other products, I can also assure you that you are not sacrificing flavor or texture by choosing the low-sugar option.

Guess what I'm eating right now?

You guessed it...Bear Naked Banana Nut Granola!

I was in the organic section of a grocery store the other night, looking for low-fat granola. (I'm on a low-fat diet to help combat elevated cholesterol and triglycerides. *wince*)

I bought myself a 12 oz. packages of the Banana Nut, as well as the Bear Naked Peak Protein Granola. The latter was so-so, but the Banana Nut? YUM!

It's delicious plain, in my opinion, but you could certainly eat it with milk/soy milk as cereal, or mix in with some yogurt. 

There are 11 servings per bag (about 1/4 cup) and here are some nutritional facts per 1/4 Cup:

140 calories (60 from fat)
Total Fat 7 g (10% DV) 
NO Trans Fat
NO Cholesterol
5 mg sodium
17 g carbs (3 g dietary fiber, 5 g sugars)
3 g protein

If you love organic, hand-made, nutritional products, Bear Naked Banana Nut is wonderful! It contains almonds, and tastes a bit like dried banana chips + tasty granola.

(P.S. The price here at Amazon is a STEAL! I would have paid over $10 more if I would have bought the same quantities at the grocery store!

I hesitate to write a review about a food because, well, one man's meat is another man's poison ...  I like the not-too-sweet and minimally processed taste of this brand; the Banana flavour is our favourite.  The Fruit and Nut flavour lacks a little oomph and the fruit inside is too tangy for my taste buds (so maybe TOO minimally processed?).  Also, remember that 'All Natural' is NOT organic, even if you find this in the health food section of your grocery store.  Our local Target also carries this brand of granola and has the best price for it

I love granola and cereal in general, but I have to say that this is the very best granola I have ever had. The people at Bear Naked have a philosophy that I love, and which is on the back of every bag: "we believe food should be hand-made from wholesome and natural ingredients you can actually pronounce." Although I do eat processed food, I appreciate the appeal of the more traditionally prepared foods, and this granola tops the list for nutrition and taste.

Like most granola, it is high in calories and fat, but take note that the fat comes largely from the nuts contained (it also contains expeller pressed canola oil), and it has no trans fat, and only 1.5g of saturated fat per serving. This cereal is softer than most granola, though not soft enough for me to consider it chewy. It does have large chunks of nuts and also contains cranberries and flax seed, for optimal nutritional and digestive health. 

The six-pack sold on Amazon makes the price per package reasonable (the ingredients are quite expensive), so as a value proposition, I think this is not only a great product, but a great buy.

Delicious and nutritious: a great combination that I recommend highly

There is a reason that Slim Jim doesn't ever quite say what it is.  It isn't a beef stick.  It isn't jerky.  It is what it is.  I remember eating them when they first came out and wondering what they were.  Now, tasting them again, I remember the question.  There is some kind of meat in there, but it is treated in a lot of different ways.  A Slim Jim is still as greasy as I remember, as well.  The trick is to enjoy them without eating them to excess.  For what they are, they are convenient, tasty, and can be fun.

While on the computer, in your car, at work or just want a tasty snack, Slim Jim is the perfect treat!  Not big enough to ruin an appetite for meals, it is just the right size to curb hunger...and tastes great!    The size of the Slim Jim in the 100 count box fits anywhere - pocket, purse, glove compartment...so you can have a snack anytime.  Enjoy

When I was a kid I ate slim jims all the time. 

I am glad that they still taste the same. 
Unfortunately, nowadays they like to change and mess with too many of the things that we grew up with and loved as children.

Here's what I used to do (and still do): I get the end real wet until the skin gets to the point that you can slough it off without breaking it. I eat the skin and then I slowly chomp the stick until it's all gone. Then I grab another and do it all over again!

And I don't care how many of these you'll try to eat in a week -- a box of 100 is guaranteed to last a long time! This is a good buy!

I recommend the good ol' slim jim!

I keep these and the cheese filled type on hand. When I need to carry a snack in my handbag to get me thru a long day, I reach for them. I keep a box in my office. This is a snack you can feel good about and enjoy. My kids are grown, but if they weren't, I'd be giving them these instead of the garbage sold widely in stores. The ingredients, quality, and taste make these a great family choice for quick snacks any time

First, I would like to remind people that these are flatbread, so they're harder & thicker than crackers.  They have a great taste.  I even eat them plain sometimes, with chili or soup, etc.  One of the things that I like about them is that they don't get soggy when I put something on them.  They stay nice & firm & crunchy.  If you're looking for a nice crunchy treat, these are wonderful.  If you don't like biting into something that's quite firm, then you'd better try something else

I thought these crackers were delicious. They had a rich flavor, and the pumpkin seeds were a nice touch. My only complaint was that they were very hard and I couldn't bite into them, I had to break them into pieces to eat them. Maybe I just have sensitive teeth?  Regardless, I thought they were very satisfying and one cracker was a very nice snack for only 100 calories.

While I agree that this soup is a bit saltier than it could/should be, I truly enjoy it. And for the record, I am horrified that anyone who's bought and doesn't like the taste would throw away perfectly good food that could be donated or given away. What a disgusting waste!
Anyway, this soup has plenty of barley, and while it doesn't have the volume of beef chunks that a Campbell's Chunky soup might have, they aren't as sparse as some of the other comments would have you think.
I found the consistency of the soup just fine when I heated it thorougly, but it can be a little gloopy when it's only warmed instead of well-heated.
I work out of my home and get some hectic days where I can't afford the time to make a lunch or go out and grab fast food. This soup is my mainstay for a quick and nourishing bowl of energy replenishment because the ease of microwaving it in the pouch can't be beat. I have just enough time to gather my bowl, spoon and iced tea and the soup is ready.
All in all, I will be buying this product again

Extremely pleased with the product and with the price point at which Amazon had offered it.

The 3.75 ounce can contains larger sardines, typically 3 or 4.  I'm looking forward to trying the 4 and 3/8 ounce cans when next offered as I suspect that it contains smaller sardines.

In any case, Reese and Amazon constitute an incredible value

I like a good cup of Joe and when our friends turned us on to Kona coffee we were instant fans.  But the cost was killing us.  So when I saw that Amazon had their new grocery line I was on it checking out their price.  This is a great cup of Kona for the price.  I hate bitter coffee - this is smooth.

I've had miso soups at various restaurants and this is actually really good.  I love the fact they are environmentally concerned with their products.  I'll buy their products just knowing they care so much about how much we have to throw away, so it's biodegradable.  Only thing I'm not crazy about is the noodles, I would have preferred a thinner noodle, only because it's so bulky, and not really typical of Asian dish

Finally there is a quick way to make a great Udon Soup at home!  For any Udon fan, this is a must try product.  The noodles are as good as Udon noodles get, and the soup mix is great base to start your Udon.  Here is the way we make Udon using this product as a base:

We take the noodles and soup mix from two packages (bowls), add some additional soy sauce and spices we like, and boil it all in a pan (you don't need to screw around with all the noodle rinsing, just throw them in the pot).  When the soup and noodles are warm, we add chopped romaine.  This is super good, and costs less than $[...] for two LARGE servings of Udon - a deal by any standard!!

When we really want a full-on Udon, we add some sliced pressed fish like the restaurants use in traditional Udon (the half moon pressed fish, white with the orange/red coating) and shrimp.  This is heavenly!!

I started to love Annie Chun's udon soup in March 2007. Although it was on my AMAZON GROCERY LIST for many months cause i read a very bad review from a guy that did not know what is great. I just ordered many A. Chun's soup noodle bowls. And i will order more again in future. Annie Chun is a cute and talented woman and she is the 1st Asian female that i admired and read her story about her soup noodle for second time on Amazon.com

I added a half of dozen or so of frozen pre-cooked shrimp and this was great as an evening meal.  The package includes the spices that one would expect to find in a Tom Yum Thai soup.  While the quality may not be what one might expect to find in a good Thai restaurant, preparation in five minutes is surely an acceptable compromise

I bought a case of these for my son - he's a toddler - and my husband and I have wound up snacking on them too. I think it's sort of hard to come up with a large assortment of quick-n-easy, 100% organic, nutritionally alright snacks these days in a super busy household and the Late July products make it simple.

These crackers are the best I've found, and my husband has tried them all. I'm the organic nut and I've slowly been converting him from conventional to organic. I'll compromise, but he won't, so whatever organic products I give him have to be as good as or better than what he's accustomed to, and Late July crackers fit the bill

I have been looking for a long time for a cracker to substitute for the main two brands available nationwide.  All the others I had tried were not approved by my family for a variety of reasons, mainly not having any taste.  These crackers are light, crispy and great-tasting.  These will replace all the other ones we used to buy, even my picky 4-year old likes them.

These delicious mini-crackers are small enough to grab a satisfying handful. Yep, it's got all the organic requisites, organically-fed cows whose lips never taste hormones or antibiotics (well, maybe these are injected, I don't know), and the crackers contain non-hydrogenated, trans-fat free organic palm oil.

The taste is mild but you can taste the cheddar, and the texture is more flakey than hard or brittle. If you grab 30 crackers (one ounce, there are 5ounces, or 150 crackers per box), you'll get 310 mg of sodium, or 13% of the Recommended Daily Value (RDV) for a 2,000 calorie diet. Now that's by any means low-sodium, but you can easily eat half of that and feel you've had a snack. Per 30 crackers, there are 4.5 grams (g) oftotal fat, of which 1.5 are saturated, and none are trans fat. Total carbohydrates are 19g, including less than 1g of sugar, but also less than 1g of dietary fiber. Hey, noone said this is health food, but compare this to what you're snacking on now (and that cheese gives it 3g of protein).

Full ingredients and nutritional information may be found at latejuly.com/products, but other good stuff includes organic wheat flour, organic whey, sea salt, and organic evaporated cane juice. Nothing artificial, no corn syrup, preservatives, hydrogenated oils, and they're both Kosher and Lacto Vegetarian (gotta make sure there's no meat in your crackers...). If that's not enough, "Late July" is independently owned and family operated.

Mainly, though, it's the light taste, the organic ingredients, and that enticing small size you can grab by the fistful.  Full information at the above-mentioned website.

My sister-in-law introduce me to this product.  We LOVE pizza in our house and we could probably eat it every single day if possible.  This crust is so easy.  My 5 year old helps us make the pizza all the time.  It's perfect for the 9" round pan.  You put sauce on and your favorite topping and into the oven it goes.  I highly recommend for everyone to try.  Especially if you have kids, this can get them involved

This microwave oven popcorn pops light and fluffy.  When it's popping, it actually smells like popcorn and not like some kind of artificially-flavored buttery grease.  There is a hint of salt and light butter.  It's really good stuff unless you're looking to replicate the trans-fat experience of the movie theater concession stand

This is the best,but so hard to find. I like one of the other reviewers had shipping problems. I waited 2 months before I received my shipment. It is worth the wait. I cannot find it where I now live, and it really goes a long way and is very flavorful. I just went and bought a large rubbermaid bottle and mixed half of the Knorr bottle and the rest with water and made a quart of broth to add to my food when cooking,it beats paying $3.00 and change for a store bought box. I do hope they bring more in...PLEAS

This product has been in my kitchen for 15 years - it was then sold and labeled Bovril.  Knorr started marketing it about 5-6 years ago.  Unfortunately they no longer carry the concentrated beef.  It gets used in soups, sauces and gravies and for cooking pasta and vegetables.  I have tried all the concentrates in the supermarket and even some commercial brands and this is the best.

Took a chance on this item and am glad I did.  You can use as much or as little as you like/need (concentrate mixes with water) and there is no extra to save for the next time or to throw away.  It stores well, takes little space, no paper sticks to the cube, and it does not clump together.  I add some to rice when I boil it to provide extra flavor.  Great for soups, sauces, a hot drink, and more.  It's a nifty treat to share a bottle with a friend but be warned, they'll go crazy trying to find it in a store

My kids love this snack. They can prepare it without problem.
It should be healthier than other common snacks. Less worry.
The macaroni is thinner than other Kraft packages, which is a plus

Being Kraft how could it be bad? Very delicious and easy to prepare . . . just squeeze out the cheese like toothpaste. No need to add butter or milk, so quite convenient and fast. The cheese product itself tastes a lot like Velveeta when eaten straight, so don't let the word 'sharp cheddar' make you think it's anything near bitter. And why would you eat it straight? Because there's always that little bit left you can't quite squeeze out, to lap up like licking the spoon, and yum!

I'm very happy that it is low mercury, but with this quality and taste, I might still eat it if they added mercury. I'm back here ordering my sixth or seventh shipment and this time I just had to leave a review.

I would give this 6 stars if I could. I love tuna and I've tried all the different major brands and many of the smaller. I get excited when I see a type I haven't tried and I snap it up and since trying this, I've always been disappointed. This brand is by far the best I've ever tasted. This  particular no salt variety is the best of those, though some of my family and friends disagree on that point.

This is not tuna for making tuna salad or even my favorite dish, the tuna melt, out of. This tuna is so good you eat it straight as it comes from the can. Makes a great tasty snack

He ate about the whole thing. I love the taste as well. The meat is from grass fed beef so there is very little fat content.My friend aasked me to order him some more. I will

I was disappointed this jerky has MSG in it which seems to add a lingering aftertaste to it's mostly salty flavor.  the jerky texture is a good balance of chewy and flakey without much gristle at all.  the jerky is not oily as many beef flavors get when compared to bison/buffalo, but it does not have any noticeable smoke in it either, which makes me wonder how they actually cure this stuff.  I consider this an average 3-star jerky, but it's remarkably low price help give it a bonus star

Warning: boring review follows! ha ha: I was interested in buying these individual servings of cereal for my family and wondered if the cups, bowls or little boxes were cheapest per ounce.  The cups hold more than the bowls and boxes(usually about twice as much based on cereal type). I mean we would have eaten 2 bowls if it was really cheaper that way.

I went to the kelloggs site to compare how much cereal was in the cups versus how much in the individual bowls or the little boxes.  The bowls, cups and boxes all seem to end up costing fractions of pennies of one another ounce per ounce.  I didn't add up all the kinds per variey pack and see which grand total costed pennies more or less based on ounce (I am not THAT frugal), but picked corn pops and frosted flakes to compare.  The prices for all the kinds are very comparable, so if your wondering which type to buy, it doesn't really add up to much difference. I do check these things because sometimes the big "value" sizes are actually more expensive per ounce/gram than the little sizes.  Those marketing people are tricky!

Therefore, if you want to have more little bowls or you pick the cups (that have more in each), you can make your choice and know you won't be spending way more either way.  I skipped choosing the boxes because I liked the convenience of the bowls, but honestly the carboard boxes are probably better for the planet (but anyway, I will save some energy, water, and soap by not washing bowls!)   Now all they need to do is sell a cute little dispenser for my counter and I will never go back to boxes

I purchased these on the special Friday sale where they were $7.99 for 3 cans. At the store where I normally shop here one can is almost $5 so this was a fantastic deal. I liked how they were lightly salted and not as salty as alot of nuts are. 

I agree with the other review that they were mostly almonds. Id say 60% almonds, 30% cashews and 10% macadamias but they were still quite good

I bought this product because it was a cheaper alternative to the Senseo coffee pods I've been buying. I don't have much else to compare with, as I've only used the Senseo products in my pod-style coffee maker. The Gala product taste just a good as the Senseo in my opinion, and it certainly is less expensive. 

One interesting note - I only received one pacakage of 18 pods, and the rest (11 packages remaining in the order) were not shipped. Upon inquiry, I was told these were no longer available, and I was promptly issued a refund for the whole order

This is now the only brand of mac and cheese I will buy, and I don't mind paying a higher price because it tastes great and is made with some organic ingredients. I find that one 6 ounce box makes 2-4 servings (depending on how hungry you are), and for optimal flavor I use both butter and a splash of milk when I mix the macaroni with the powdered cheese

I have tried 10 different brands of flaxseed meal and can tell you that this is by far the best tasting and has the most consistent quality. There are two types of flaxseeds, brown and golden. Both have the same nutritional value, but golden flaxseed is significantly smoother in taste and not as pungent/bitter aftertaste.  I especially like Bob's Red mill for the organic offerings at a minimal price increase. I regularly sprinkle 1-2 tablespoons on my cereal in the morning to give it a nutritional punch of fiber, protein and essential fatty acids. The texture is very fine and almost has no noticeable effect on the cereal, if I went with 1 Tbls, you wouldn't even know it was there. I highly recommend giving Bob's products a try, I am sure you will find it as enjoyable as I have. Always store flaxseed meal refrigerated, opened or not

An excellent product inside, I just wish the packaging were different.  Information recommends the flaxseed be stored in its opaque packaging.  But it's just a bag.  So I cut off the top and hope my clip won't slip off and I'll have flaxseed spilled all over the refrigerator shelf.  Better packaging might be a shaker container like what's used for parmesan cheese, but opaque.

The package is big and you have to buy 4 so even using some every day on my cereal, I will have flaxseed for a long time from this order.  Store extras in the freezer, put the one you're using in the refrigerator

I had never heard of these, and when I came across the product listing I thought these were going to be more like "around the house snacks" given the description and comments.

These are only really enjoyable to eat in the same way whey protein shakes or powerbars or other "good for you" meal replacement or snack-like food units are enjoyable:  they stop the hunger with a minimum of fuss.

The balls are fairly dense.. prepare to "gnaw" on them.  Taking a bite is a commitment.  The texture with all the exterior seeds is coarse.  The peanut butter flavor is, well, faint.  Using the words "great tasting" in the marketing is stretching the truth a bit, IMHO.  (I would not buy these for taste alone.)

On the plus side, they work.  I was running out of the house without having had breakfast, so I threw two balls in my pocket and ate them in the first 10 minutes of driving.  My hunger reacted the same way it would to any other 400-calorie breakfast -- it went away, and stayed away until lunch.  There was no negative aftertaste or other unpleasantness, and it made me feel like I had eaten food rather than some sort of snacky candy thing.

I don't have a particular allergy related need for this product, although I like the fact that it doesn't use refined sugar.  I'm not sure how much of this product I will order in the future, but I can foresee finishing this pack

I'm a big fan of good jerky; made plenty of my own, and this stuff is great.   It's a little pricey, but the quality and flavor are worth it.  It is on the sweet side, but that's to be expected hence the name "sweet n' spicy".  You won't be disappointed. I couldn't keep my hands off the 8 bags and scarfed them down in 4 days--dirty gluttonous pig

I prefer variety so most of the time I drink Starbucks house blend and sometimes masala chai (spiced tea). Then occasionally I treat myself with illy. The illy medium roast is very smooth and mild with no aftertaste or bitterness. It is perhaps the best coffee you can buy. It is about twice the cost of Starbucks, but well worth it

Confession: I have been a true fan of Starbucks. I used to think Starbucks was the best coffee ever and the many bags of Starbucks in my pantry will prove that! However, I recently received a gift of a half pound of Illy Espresso Coffee, Medium Grind and I was for once in my life, truly impressed with the quality, flavor, and aroma of this coffee. I also find this to be heartbreaking as I do not know what to do with all my Starbucks that I have on hand. I just gave 3 pounds of my Starbucks to my mother-in-law since I will not be drinking it anymore. If you are a true coffee conesseiur then you will love Illy coffee. If I ever open a coffee shop, I would be more than happy to invest in this company.

No need to pay more when Reese's are the same as pricier brands. Plus I found no tiny grit and no damaged sardines.

You'll avoid busting off the ring when opening the can by bending the ring so it touches the can rim and then pulling up

I recently purchased a full case of the Melitta One Hazelnut flavored pods - to use in my Melitta One coffee maker - and I can honestly say Melitta coffee is the best I've had of all the brands I've tried.

One nice touch: every Melitta coffee pod is individually foil-packed for freshness, which is apparent from the first sip. I've tried other brands that were stale and tasteless.

Also, the Melitta One Skip the Buzz is the very best decaf I've ever tasted in my life.

I give Melitta One my strongest recommendation.

Okay. I don't see how anyone could not like this drink. Granted, it doesn't taste as good as RedBull, but the flavor definitely isn't crappy. Since I tried the sugar free version, it definitely tastes less watered down than the Red Bull sugar free version as well.
The reason I bought this was because I wanted a sugar free energy drink that wouldn't cost be 3 dollars a pop (I have been drinking Red Bull). You should get sugar free because 1)it is a lot healthier 2) when you pull an all nighter, you shouldn't have all that sugar in your teeth anyway. Liquid Lightning is not only sugar free, but it is a lot more healthy compared to Red Bull, since it has only 5 calories, 0 Sodium (Red Bull has a lot), 100% vitamin C...
It tastes good too, and for ~1 a can, you can't go wrong! Highly recommended.

I work in a business that sells gourmet coffee beans so I like to check out the competition. We sell lots of organic coffee. These espresso roast beans were perfectly roasted. The coffee is smooth and deceptively subtle for such a dark roast. I was jealous. The blend was just right. Clean on the palate with an immaculately gentle mouth feel. Well done

My family has been eating Fig Newmans for years. Figs are great for you, but how do you get kids to eat them? The answer is Fig Newmans. Since they're organic, you can feel good that your little ones aren't ingesting pesticides along with the cookies. Two Fig Newmans will fill you up and keep you going. They're a great snack

I have been eating Seven in the Morning, now called Seven Whole Grain

my local grocery store.  Thank goodness for Amazon!  This cereal is
tasty and satisfying.  Crunchy texture if you eat it right away, gets
softer if you let it sit in the milk a few minutes.  Love it with fruit

I love the smell of this product.  I have tried other coconut oils, and they are not the quality of Nutiva.  You can use this for so many things.  It is a great, light-weight moisturizer.  I also love to put it on my hair.  It adds a great taste to smoothies, and I have also used it to cook with.  This is a very versatile product.  I love it

I love these figs. The natural flavor is well preserved and there's no added sugar which makes it a great healthy snack when those between-meals hunger pangs hit you. I've quickly run through my 6 pack

Wow! These bars are sooo good. Outside of regular Clif bars, these are my favorite. I wish amazon sold more than just three flavors.

Texture is good and the ingreds are high quality. 

I'm not a vegan, but these would be a staple for me if I were....Actually, they are a staple for me. :

We love Hodgson Mills products!  Their Gingerbread is great and they have whole wheat bread machine mixes which I have trouble finding here in the frozen north!  It's nice to get these products via Amazon.  The price is better per case from Hodgson Mills directly but with 2 day free shipping I get with Amazon it evens out and ordering is so easy with Amazon. Nice addition!

I've received my second order of this product.  This time I ordered the larger size.  This is an excellent alternative sweetener.  It has no after taste like a lot of the artificial sweeteners. I use it in my drinks, cereals and cooked dishes.  I've never tried baking with it.  I highly recommend this product - try it, you'll like it!

I bought this one and the dark variety.  They are both very good; kind of a gentle sweetening agent, not in your face sweet like white sugar.
I preferred the dark type as it seemed to have more flavor, but this one's taste is probably better for most baking recipes,  as it would impart a less assertive note.
No trouble using agave in all my recipes both sweet and savory, like that little bit of sweeteness one wants in a Thai dish, for example

I eat this meal about twice weekly and find it is extraordinary. Until Ensavor came along, I had not tasted an instant meal so tasty with just the right spice and zest that was actually created with good ingredients. Why is that so difficult?  This stew tastes just great over a bed of short brown rice and has just enough liquid and protein to complement the vegetables that are cooked just right

I don't know how is it that someone took rice and made it taste so good, but I have been eating these for several months now.  They are extremely addictive.  Sometimes I find myself getting up in the middle of the night just to eat them. Not too sweet, and no stomach reaction from someone like me, who can't tolerate gluten.  I have tried all of the flavors, and they are equally satisfying.  Of course, this is a processed food and has no live nutrients as they say, but its the only snack I eat really when I buy processed foods

I hate flavored coffees, but this one was the exception.  The K-Cup process seems to add a hint of a a frothy flavor, but not so much as to hide the flavor of the bean.

I drink a lot of coffee, so buying K-Cups at the department store is prohibitively expense.  This coffee was excellent and the price was extremely reasonable.  Throw in free delivery and this is the only way to buy K-Cups (even cheaper than eBay and so much less hassle

Green is good, of course. But what's much better than green are these truly awesome cookies. PN Os beat the bootie out of any Oreo variation -- crunchier, more filling(without being smarmy), much better taste. (And this goes for the mint, the vanilla, and the chocolate.)

Fast Eddie Felson -- I love you.

These high-sodium ginger cookies are too tasty to have around - you'll easily surpass your RDA of sodium in one sitting.  

The nutrition facts that Amazon neglected to post are: Serving size is 2 cookies (28 g).  Each serving has 160 mg of sodium, 4.5 mg of fat (2 g saturated, 0 g transfat), 19 g of total carbs (10 g sugars), and 0 g of cholesterol.

The ingredients in these "Made in U.S.A." cookies are organic unbleached wheat flour, powdered sugar, organic palm fruit oil, organic molasses, organic sugar, sodium bicarbonate (leavening), ground ginger, soy lecithin (an emulsifier), salt, monocalcium phosphate (leavening), and nutmeg.  There are no hydrogentated oils or trans fats.

On the back of the package is an Ode to Ginger-O's, which reads: "You might, m'lady tweak my nose. You could, m'lord step on my toes.  But Heaven help those poor bozos, who try to filch my Ginger-O's ".

Again, these high-sodium cookies taste too good in order to effectively exercise self-discipline to limit the quantity eaten.

Panko breadcrumbs, for anyone that has not used them, are the best things for fried chicken, fried fish, crumb toppings and anything else you can think of for breadcrumbs. They don't get soggy, or fall off the meat/fish. Some products are not what they are trumped up to be. Panko breadcrumbs are the exception. I gave a box to my girlfriend and we both profess to be good cooks. She has a yen for fried chicken and was just amazed how well the panko breadcrumbs held up. Her husband kept raving about them. I am glad I bought 6 boxes, you will be too

   I like this stuff. I initially thought I liked the Sumatra 
blend best and ordered a box of that. Sumatra is kind of
"sweet" but not in the sense that it contains sugar. Brazil and Columbia are similar but different and Kenya is, for lack of a better word "dry". If I make a cup of Kenya and don't wash out the machine before the next it will come out tasting like Kenya blend. Kenya is ok but probably not going to be my favorite. I just ordered another variety pack to help me decide while I wake up.

Weight Watchers point that is.  The bag is one point.  A great, healthy snack to incorporate into your WW diet, or any other healthy lifestyle.

I haven't had a problem with crumbs and powder in the packets I've tried, no more than any other dried fruit I'd buy from Trader Joes or the Gerber ones.  It's definitely a small bag for the price, so if you're near a Trader Joes, you should really buy their dried fruits.

Amazon does have a great price for this item though... I paid $1.79 for one packet at a major chain!!  That's insanity

In principle, this is a great product:  It's actual fruit, with nothing added, dried to a crisp and put in a packet that only has 85 calories.  If you're looking for light, healthy-ish snack foods that are still tasty, this is a great choice.

But there are a couple of problems:

1.  The packets are very narrow and long, which makes it virtually impossible to reach into them to get the fruit out, once you're past the top third or so.

2.  There's a decent amount of fruit dust inside -- which, as these are berries and cherries, is red, and just waiting for a bit of added water to  stain up any fabric it lands on.

Either of these in isolation is no problem, but put them together, and you've got a product that you MUST pour out, and yet a product that you CAN'T pour out.  I guess maybe if you had a bowl or something, it wouldn't be a big deal, but that sort of takes away the portable-snack nature of it, no?  As much as I liked the fruit, the inconvenience of the packaging is going to keep me from buying more.

Oh, and one more caveat:  Despite the "Cherry Berry" name, this is at least 50% apple.  I suspect that apples are to dried fruit mixes what peanuts are to mixed nuts, the inexpensive and unobjectionable filler.  The apple tastes fine and all, but I wouldn't mind more cherries and berries, and fewer apples

The fruit is "crunch dried" via a unique process developed by Sensible Foods, making it more than just your run-of-the-mill dried fruit snack. It's naturally sweet, it's crunchy, it's delicious and it's healthy. What more can you ask for? My dog loves the dried apple bits as well. It's his favorite treat. My one qualm with the product is that I'm a guy and for me the serving size is just too small... So, I usually eat 2 packs at a time.

Your kids will love it, your pets will love it, and you will love it

As the mother of three children, two of whom are Celiacs, I can honestly say... I love this stuff!  It has a very nice taste, very nice texture, and it's SAFE for my children to eat. We don't have to worry about toxic grains with this one. It's chocolately, without being "too" chocolatey. And, it's small enough that it's not a choking hazzard for little ones.

I like the serving size of 1.5 ounces in these packs - sometimes 1 ounce just isn't enough.  They have a nice flavor, rather like dry roasted peanuts, since they have some spice added (paprika, onion and garlic powder, et al)  I think the sugar content is a little high.  I'd have given them 5 stars otherwise.  Nice change from oil roasted almonds, which can seem too oily to me sometimes, or raw almonds.

At less than $2 a pound, it's hard to find better granola for your money.

The taste isn't quite as good as the Bear Naked brand I've also gotten from Amazon, but it's easily half the price. 

A little dry, but eaten as a cereal with milk - the taste is perfect.  I'll be less likely to just "snack" on this granola because of the texture/dryness, but will gladly use it as a breakfast cereal or on yogurt.  Plenty of nuts and cocunut in it, as I had hoped

We eat nachos three or four times a week in our house, so we go through lots of corn tortilla chips. And these are the best tasting we've found. You can really taste the corn in them, not just corn flour. They're flavorful but not overpowering with just the right amount of salt. 

I only give them four stars because the box that contained the bags was fairly flimsy and got crushed by UPS so a lot of the bags contained little more than crumbs

This is a nice blend of flavors.  The cacao nibs provide a mere hint of choco flavor, so don't expect to brew a "mocha" in one quick session here.  I tend to make strong coffee and some can come out a little bitter.  This one is quite smooth.  I could use a little darker roast than this turned out to be, but to Jeremiah's credit, it is advertised as a "medium/dark" roast.  I'd call it medium, but taste IS subjective, is it not?  For a baseline, I currently call Starbuck's Caffe Verona my favorite.  Overall, for the price (especially with the 10 off of 50 promo, thanks Amazon) this is quite good.

I first discovered these crackers when looking for an alternative to wheat due to allergies.  They're very hearty and go well with a lot of spreads/toppings.  The combination of the seeds makes for a great nutty flavor

Good cracker. I ordered a dozen due to the excellent price. I was thinking I would keep them on hand. The expiration date was less than two months away! These crackers lose their appeal soon after the expiration because the seeds become rancid. If you buy, buy in small quantity

I got hooked by first trying the flatbreads based on so many favorable reviews here. When I discovered the same 3 seed crackers in bite size -  that was it!

They taste Great, are good for you, and are very reasonably priced - the ideal combination. And, the containers are re-usable. All told ... very, very cool (that's older person speak for 'way cool')

Make up a batch of tuna salad, dip it out with these crackers, yummy lunch or dinner! These crackers are much heartier than your typical saltine or Triscuit. I find the whole ones a little too big to eat unless I break them up first. This tub variety is just the right size: 1-2 bites worth. Holds up very well to cold cheese spreads too.

After trying many of the richer coffees in the K-Cup field, this coffee was both bold and smooth straight up. As an alternative, add a little warmed milk and it tastes like the coffees served in the coffee houses dripped out of the filter stand in Colombia and Costa Rica. No grinds from the packet; smooth and bold using the 7oz Keurig setting and robust using the 5 oz setting. ENJOY

This is one espresso grind that I actually enjoy over and over again.  There is no strange after-taste with some other "premium" brands.  This is a coffee lover's coffee.  It is rich and deep with a slightly nutty undertone.  Try it.  You won't regret it.

The canister is nice, too

If you like your coffee a little lighter bodied then what the Cafe Kilimanjaro is, then this is your coffee. When I'm making coffee for guests and they don't want a dark roast that I normally drink I throw some Espresso Milano in the machine and make a cup with it and I've never received a complaint about it. Usually I'm asked where the coffee is from and what kind it is. It's a perfect fair-trade, organic medium roast from Pura Vida.

The prunes were wonderful - highly recommended.  Unfortunately, over and over Amazon kept sending us just one little bag instead of the case of 12 bags it is supposed to be that we ordered, despite repeatedly contacting them.  They finally just refunded the price after about the 3rd time around with the same mistake.  I hope they get their system straightened out - or get rid of the constipated employee in shipping pilfering the prunes. ;

This sweet treat is, as they say, a lesser evil. It's not health food, in that it's a sweet combination of vanilla and chocolate, but it is much hearlthier than other carmel and chocolate popcorns out there--just check the ingredients. Other reviewers complaining about the nutritional fact panel or the health benefits of this product don't quite get it.

Some reviewers have noted that this is not kettle corn are correct. Others who say this is half caramel corn miss the "black and white" across the front of the bag--it's not caramel, it's vanilla. The chocolate half is delicious--cocoa-laden and therefore perfect when you want something light; not chocolate dipped, which would be overwhelming, heavy, and creamy. The vanilla half is also not dipped, heavy, or overwhelming. It's a lightly sweet plain corn taste to cleanse your palate for more chocolate.

People who love the New England tradition of black and white cabinets (milkshakes, frappes...can't we all just get along?) will adore this popcorn. People trying to avoid nasty chemical ingredients will appreciate this corn. People who love subtle flavors will love this treat. People who think Oreos are really good won't "get" this snack, nor do people who weigh and measure every kernel because they're watching calories. It's a sugary (albeit natural sugar with no hydrogenated oils) snack. It's the lesser of all the evils out there--and makes being nutritionaly bad feel really good

The quality of this good, but the Kettle Corn flavor did not do much for me. I have had other kettle corn and liked it. This was less sweet and more salt than what I prefer. It's not bad, I still manage to choke down the entire bag, but it's not what I was hoping for. Think I may still try the cinnamon though, I hope I like that one better

The chocolate is mild enough not to overwhelm, but strong enough to sate a chocolate-craving. The "kettle corn" part really is just caramel corn, but it's really good, ESPECIALLY considering there is no corn syrup, preservatives, trans fats, artificial flavors, or gluten.  Compared to other "snack" foods, I feel no guilt in eating this

When I was young, a while ago, sardines didn't come three or so to the flat can as they do now; they were small fish, young sprat. The very best were so tiny that they were packed crossways and two layers deep, lightly smoked, in oil. These still are, and at the best price I've seen in years. The taste is utterly different from the cheap supermarket brands. If sardines could be elegant, these would be

I regularly buy this product because I don't think I could live without it!!  Like some of the other reviewers I am also Irish, born and bred, and it really helps to have such an easy product to bake which tastes wonderful.  I will have to try the suggestion of one of the other reviewers, one egg and substitute the water for milk, sounds like an idea, thanks!  I would certainly HIGHLY RECOMMEND trying this product, it's really worth every penny and cheap too

This is really good Irish brown bread! Not only does it taste exactly like the yummy brown bread you get in Ireland, it is also super easy to make. Just add water to the mix and bake for about 40 minutes. I don't want to forget to mention that it is really good for you as the first two ingredients are whole wheat flour and oats. Enjoy

Some products are better by the dozen, but I think that I would have rather opted for a variety pack if I were to buy another 12-pack of Zataran's. If you are reading this review, then you have probably already tried the dirty rice, since you are about do buy a dozen packets of it. So you already know that it is a decent mix (we add our own spices to it to give it even more kick).

I bought a box of this oatmeal at our local grocery store, thinking it would make a nutritious easy to make breakfast for me.  I was surprised it tasted so good.  It's slightly sweet, just the way I like it.

The real test was when my 16 year old asked me if she could try it.  She loved it! Now the only problem is keeping enough of it on hand for the both of us. 

I heat the water in the microwave, and add it to the oatmeal in a bowl.  It is nice to have a healthy choice for breakfast that is so easy to prepare

I originally bought a bag of this at the local grocery store because of the health claims on the packaging. Since then I've bought a bunch of it from Amazon grocery.

I use it mostly on my breakfast cereal, but have also used it in baking, including the muffin recipe on the package. I can't recommend that recipe because the muffins have too much stuff in them (carrot and apple shavings, nuts, raisins, etc.) and the muffins wouldn't hold together except for the gooey consistency of the baked product. Yuck.

However, in a pizza crust it's great, adding extra flavor and texture that is both unfamiliar and satisfying. I like having taste in the pizza crust as much as in the toppings, and adding some flaxseed meal helps add flavor.

It also goes well in other baked goods, and I've used it in cookie recipes, quick breads, etc

Bob's Red Mill is a high quality food company.  The Organic Flaxseed Meal is a versatile, easy to use food for healthy consumption of Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Lignans.  I have used several different brands of flaxseeds.  Bob's Red Mill Organic is by far the most flavorful and is ground to a consistancy that is perfect as a flour (substitute about 1/4 of the flour in muffin and bread recipes) or add the meal to homemade peanut butter or sprinkle on yogurt or cereal.  I keep the flaxseed meal frozen and use as much as needed out of the bag straight from the freezer.  My kitchen is never without this naturally wonderful organic food.  [..

We love this all natural, organic apricot.
Very sweet and soft. Worth the money. You pay more at a health food store per bag. I,ve been shopping from the health food stores for over 25 years. Let me say that the color is not as bright and cheerful as the non- organic counterpart but keep in mind that this is all natural. It was not treated with chemicals, preservatives or colorings. This is good tasting and good for you. For me, it is good quality and deliscious. I will order this again and other natural fruit products by them. Enjoy

I am a busy woman and yet I have to serve top quality and delicious meals that take little time to prepare. Well, this rice with roasted chicken meal is one of my secrets in the kitchen. It is organic, takes a few minutes to prepare in the microwave and I haven't head anything less than "it's great". The quantity is significant so one purchase lasts for a long time. I am very, very pleased with it and high recommend it

These are my favorite cookies.   They are so easy to make but you must use real butter for the best taste.  I always keep a package in the cabinet for short notice needs.  Just add butter and egg!   I love to roll the dough into balls and then roll the balls in sugar and cinnamon to make a special snickerdoodle.

They are also great crumbled up into hot cereal and yogurt instead of sugar

WOW!  I am impressed with these snacks.  A whole apple in each bar and no added suger of any kind! I love the convenience of these fruit bars.  We snack mostly on fruit here in the house, but sometimes it's not convenient to carry fruit with you on outings.  So I've been looking for something like this for a long time and it's better than I expected, much better than most fruit leathers you can find in a health store.
These strawberry snacks have also been tested by a three and four year old pallet and they always ask for more.  
They're so good I've ordered more of another flavor

I love ESE pods.  I know some coffee snobs disagree, but I'll take 90% of the taste for 10% of the work any day.  As for pods, I've had Starbucks, Illy, and Espressione Arabica.  I like the Espressione the best.  I lived in Italy for 3 years and hit the coffee bars daily - I know what I like in espresso.  The Starbucks was a bit too rough, too American tasting.  Suprisingly, though, the Starbucks pods tasted just like an espresso at one of their stores.  Very consistent.  The Illy is too smooth.  It goes well with food, and after dinner, but I tend to take my espresso at breakfast, and prefer a bold, smooth taste.  The Espressione Arabica achieves just that.  I'll be buying it again for my every day use

These pods have got to be the best invention yet. They are compact, extremely easy to use & is the best solution to making several very quick cups of coffee. 

Fresh ground coffee is nice, but there is virtually no mess with these pods. The crema is just as good as ground coffee & these can be used in a pod holder as well as a one cup filter basket.
What more could a person want?!

I have enjoyed those pods for more than a year with my Frances Frances Espresso machine, but today I am a little bit concerned about the fact that your price went from $37.99 last month to $60.00 today... Why? The advantage of buying 150 pods at once was to cut down on the price, if it is the same price or more expensive than other stores, do we still have a reason to purchase them from Amazon? Please enlighten me! I would be very sorry to have to go elsewhere. Thanks

This is a tasty cereal. It has a good crunchy texture. It is one of a few safe foods my daughter can eat. It has no extra preservatives, colors, gluten etc.. It has been a lifesaver for us to find a food that dose not have a lot of extra preservatives, dyes, etc that could make her ill. It has been a lifesaver as it is one of her main foods in food trialing. She can only eat rice at this point. We buy it by the case. Thank you Erewhon!! for making it and Amazon for supplying

This cereal is like rice crispies and it taste good but better with fruit.  There is also a Erewhon Crispy Brown Rice Ceral with mixed berries that is much better for me although I have not been able to get it lately.  This is a great gluten free product for those who have to avoid gluten products.  Celiac disease suffers are always looking for tasteful foods that are gluten free.  I hope more products become available in bulk for us.

I tried this item since I was intrigued from the product description and I was actually surprised from the delicacy of the white tea. I love orange based teas and this is a great one : does not have a strong taste that overpower the white tea and has a great aroma. Definitely I will try also the other white teas. Note the order is 2 boxes of 50 each. The package inside the can of 50 contain 2 packages with 25 tea bag each..And one more stuff..the price is great for white te

This stuff is great! It's funny that all the previous reviews said use this if your child can't drink cow's milk....NO, use this INSTEAD OF COW'S MILK!!! :D This is so much better for your baby than cow's milk...it's much closer to human milk than cow's milk. Goat's are much closer to us than cow's...cow's chew cud and have 4 stomachs....they eat food, and regurgitate it later and finish chewing it, then it goes through several processing chambers/stomachs. Think about it, a baby cow drinking milk from it's mama is going to process it's food the same way that mama cow is processing her's, WE DON'T HAVE 4 STOMACHS, why would our babies drink that milk???...why should we think that cow's milk is going to be sufficient for our needs? Goat's graze, they eat little bits of food all day, and their food steadily processes through their bodies (hence if you ever have been around goats you'll see they eat and poop, eat and poop...it process very quickly through their bodies. Just like we do, we process our food very quickly and need foods that we can digest/absorb very quickly and easily. That's REALLY why Cow's milk is not the best for us...not just because of lactose and all the hormone/antibiotic stuff (yeah that stuff too but that's not the MAIN reason). However, it's the main source you see because it's CHEAP and EASY to obtain, thin about how many goats it would take to produce the same amt of milk a cow produces...it's all about supply and demand. But heck anyone could own a goat and milk it, easily! I can't wait to have a farm of my own someday so I can have goat's milk for the whole family! :D


But as for Meyenberg powdered milk, this stuff is so easy to mix and so convenient with a toddler!!! Just take it with you and mix it whenever you need it, and don't worry about it spoiling in the fridge or running out and having to go to the store to find that they are out. I REALLY wanted to keep breastfeeding beyond a year but my supply just couldn't keep up with my son's needs at that point. So I weaned him and have given him some cow's milk and mostly Goat's milk and now I have pretty much stayed only with the Goat's milk. and I can tell that he likes the flavor MUCH better, and his BM's are not loose and watery like with cow, and he doesn't have as much gas with this either.

And gosh what an EXCELLENT PRICE!!!! Thanks AMAZON!

This is the best stuff going for a child that is unable to drink formula or soy milk. I used it for my son when he was a baby. I started him on it when he was about 3 months old, because of allergies and his doctor said to leave him on the soy milk even though it was causing him much discomfort. I couldn't just let my son suffer and took it upon myself to put him on goats milk and ended up with a healthy kid and a doctor who was also a convert

My daughter is allergic to soy & cow's milk, but tolerated goat milk very well. She has been drinking it since she was 12 months. It's nice having a powder so we can take it with us when we are on the go. There is more information about the milk itself on the meyenberg website. After looking over the website, I felt confident that goat milk would meet my daughter's nutritional needs

My almost-two-year-old is allergic to cow's milk, so we give him a mixture of goat's milk and rice milk.  Liquid goat's milk is expensive, at least where I live, so we switched to the powdered form a few months ago.  I don't drink milk, but my son seems to like it okay.  Goat's milk products have a distinct flavor that you either love or hate; I love it in goat cheese and goat butter, but my wife hates it.  Judge for yourself

Maybe this says something about the psychedelic effects of jasmine tea.  First, anon_2003 thinks there are snails in the teabag.  Then Graham rips anon for saying they were in the bottom of the cup, even though anon wrote that they were in the bag, not the cup.  I guess this is the proverbial tempest in a teacup.

In any case, I like this jasmine tea.  It's not too perfumed, and does have a smooth taste.  No snails.  But . . . wait!  There are little green men in that teabag!

I have purchased this tea for quite a while and it is the best tea out there for Jasmine Green Tea. The taste is not overwhelming and the finish is smooth and sweet. I have never had any snails or other "non-leaf" items in my tea! Besides, if it comes as a tea bag, how can the snails be in the bottom of your cup?? Shouldn't they be in your bag? I think you should wash your cups more often, or step away from the pipe!

We stumbled upon this brand of pasta on Amazon by searching their gluten-free options.  We are long time pasta lovers though recently learned our family cannot eat gluten (in wheat).

I've reordered this Sparkling Blood Orange and Cranberry juice three times now. Clearly, it has been a winner at our house. The flavor is a very definite blood orange flavor with a slight cranberry back-up and a gentle fizz as a bonus. The juice is a beautiful dark red color that looks fantastic when served in a nice crystal glass. The next time you need a special juice to serve at a brunch, try this one. Your guests will love it

Bought a case of this beverage and enjoyed it very much.
tangy, citrusy, unique taste, with just a bit of carbonation to move it along. Unfortunately, it is WAY overpriced.

This is wonderfully unique flavored soda although a bit pricey.  Just the right balance of sweet and tart along with a bit of fizz makes for a great flavor treat.  We bought a case and it took us through the holidays, everyone really enjoyed them (children & adults included).  I would certainly keep some around the house during holidays and special occasions, but it's too expensive to replace our usual beverage of choice

Excellent taste and quality. To me, worth the price as best of show for canned tuna. I will give it six stars if the net weight is truely 7.5 oz. The only comparable quality albacore tuna we have found is also troll caught and solid pack, and sold out of Gig Harbor, WA by the "Tuna Guys".
By the way, I have no doubt that the low mercury claim is legit

Teff replaces oatmeal as a hot breakfast cereal. Teff's pretty unique, its a tiny seed. It doesn't get mushy when cooked, but does stick together. To cook it boil it in water- use about 1/2C Teff to 2 1/2 C water- to serve two or one large guy. Add some salt too, say 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon and just boil until thick. Stir so it doesn't stick to the pan. Flavor is kind of nutty but mild and its really good. Its much higher in protein and complex carbs so you can feel the difference around noon- still with you. Its a definite must have for athletes and if you can afford it everyone else. You may also like grated orange peel, nutmeg, cinnamon or for us we add toasted anise seed as well for peak flavor. We serve it with milk and a pinch of sugar. Its excellent, if you prepare any dish like this you will probably find Teff is better than all of them. Take advantage of the shipping deal when you buy two boxes

I bought this to add variety to my diet, and tried the teff pudding recipe on the back - delicious, I think. My family didn't agree, but they did like the bread I made with teff flour. Hmm...perhaps if I soaked the grain overnight first, that would make for a smoother pudding. Try the pudding, or add the grain to a mix for breakfast or as a side dish - it's healthy and it tastes good.

More difficult than oatmeal or quinoa to cook for breakfast: the small grains must be shaken apart once added to the water, and more frequent stirring required to avoid a sticky gel-like mass on the bottom of the pan. These minor annoyances aside, teff has excellent flavor and nutritional benefits, including 20% of the RDA for Iron. Great with fruits and nuts for breakfast, or as a base for vegetables in a casserole

These are VERY good healthy alternatives to regular graham crackers.  The comment above that states she won't try any of the other products is TOTALLY missing out on something very good.  I have purchased all of the crackers they make and love every one of them.  Anyone I share them with also loves them!  If you are looking for healthy crackers (without the trans fat and other nasty chemical ingredients found in almost every other cracker in the supermarket), you should certainly try these.  As for the grahams not being crispy, I have to agree, sometimes they aren't as crunchy as I would like, but then again, most graham crackers are not.  Try the other dr. krackers if you want a real crunch!! :

I have tried many types of canned herring but Crown Prince Natural Kipper snacks are the BEST.There is barely any liquid in the can,each can is packed full with delicious smoked herring. These kipper snacks are wild caught and low in sodium so they are a very healthy way to get your Omega 3's,high in protein too. If you are like me and don't always have to time to cook fish, this is a perfect way to enjoy the heart healthy benefits of fish

I LOVE this product as it's just the right size for me to eat for lunch or to snack on with crackers.
I had bought this product from my local grocery, but if one buys enough groceries on site the shipping is free & there is usually a discount that applies so the cost was just an added benefit.
I also send these to some of our guys in Iraq as they 'keep' forever, don't require any opener, package easily, and the package is compact & easy to dispose of with little room  needed.
I like this smaller package so I don't have leftovers the next day.
The amount is more than adequate for me to have one sandwich with enough left to snack on later.
I prefer tuna in water instead of oil, and I have always hated having to squeeze the water out of canned tuna so this easy open package with very little liquid has been great.
Love this product and will definitely continue to buy

This is a very good price for Crystal Light Lemonade. The only place that equals it is Costco, and my nearest Costco is far away. I just don't get there often enough. The Costco price is the same as this - but you can buy just one box (instead of three). Even when my local supermarkets have a buy one / get one free deal on the regular-sized canisters; it doesn't come out to be as cheap per ounce as this is.

My husband drinks this stuff almost exclusively. I never cared for any diet drinks myself - until I married him and tasted his lemonade. It's so tart and lemony, that you can rarely taste the artificial sweetener at all! I now drink the Crystal Light Iced Tea - mixed with some brewed mint tea. I never thought I'd be a diet drink drinker - but now I am - thanks to this product

These are all of my favourite breakfast cereals. Good to eat any time, breakfast, snack, lunch, dinner, and after dinner snack.

Buying in bulk makes it possible to not have to shop so often. Each yummy box contains enough for one child or adult. Some of us even like to eat them without milk, or as a "on the go" snack. Perfect.

This huge pack of 40 total boxes will last you a while.

Normally, unsweetened puffed cereal is an eating experience best compared to munching on a styrofoam cup. But not Kashi puffed cereal. The whole grains (wheat, brown rice, spelt, sesame, buckwheat, triticale and others) are Kashi's special blend and they make for a tender-crunchy mix that has flavor. I like it so well, I eat it dry as a snack instead of nuts or chips. The different grains have different textures and density, making it an interesting cereal yet light, low in calories and healthy. It's good this comes in batches of six boxes because I certainly go through it.

This is the only Kashi product I like. It is low calorie (100), fun to eat, doesn't get soggy fast ( I like crunchy cereal, won't eat soggy )and a good out of the box snack if you're desperate. Tastes good if you like puffed cereal. Works well with my eating plan.

I lost 20 lbs. eating this as a part of WeightWatchers plan. A bit of Splenda, fruit, milk, it makes a great filling breakfast. I spend alot of time reading labels and this is one of the only cereals at HEB without a bunch of sugar. I am going to keep it in my cupboard at all times. HEB quit carrying it and instead have the Honey Kashi. So I ordered a case from Amazon! A lot cheaper and less hassle. It arrived quickly

This product is excellent in many ways.  It comes with single serving bags, which is very filling without being too much at one time.  I have been buying two cases per order from Amazon.com for over a year and there has never been any problem at all.  These are actually healthy, great tasting and the "proper portion" bags take the worry out of eating nuts.  In addition, the mixture of nuts is delicious without having to buy other kinds.  The price and the packaging are excellent too

The Illy is the best commercial Italian coffe that you can find not only in the USA but in Italy too. It is pricy but it is really worth all the money that you spend on it. Illy has a smooth velvet-like taste that roll on your tongue. The smell is sooting and relaxing, but is strong enough to weak you up no matter how sleepy you feel. I highly raccomand it to everyone, because if you like coffe you can't help but love it, and if you don't like coffe, you will love Illy anyway. It's just too god.

Illy Dark Roast Pods provide a great-tasting cup of espresso with crema and without the mess of cleaning up all those grounds. The tin packaging is compact for easy storage, but I recommend keeping the opened pods in a vacuum container to maintain freshness. If you're willing to invest in two 18-pod tins, you can't beat the price on Amazon!

For a slightly different great taste and individual packaging to maintain freshness, try Espressione as an alternative, though the individual packaging requires additional storage space in your cupboard

yes, these pods are slightly larger than the regular ones, but you can make two cups (2x4oz or 1x8oz) out of 1 pod and the price is right. I use the 1-cup insert, squeeze the pod a little so the coffee gets loose inside, when I close the senseo lid, I push at the lever and lid at the same time

So I had this enormous coffeemaker and I like to have a cup of coffee before I buzz off to work.  Problem: Mr. Coffee and I don't seem to see eye-to-eye when it comes to getting the grounds/water ratio right for just a cup or two in the morning.  I found one of these single cup coffeemaker thingies at Target.  Get this!  They were offering a 6-pack of 18-count coffee pod packages for $39.99 ... and you got the machine for free!  As a result of my rocky relationship with Mr. Coffee, I was easily bellying up to the bar(ista) and spending $39.99 in a month at Starbucks, so I bit.  The manufacturer of the JV Pod machine I bought recommends using only JV (short for "Juan Valdez") Pod brand pods, of course.  The trouble was, I had trouble finding them after the first batch I got with the machine.  I bought several packs of these Melitta guys (different flavors) from Amazon to use in my JV Pod coffeemaker.  Since a friend has a Melitta machine, I sprang for enough of these pods to qualify for the free Super Saver shipping and figured I'd give them to her if they didn't work for me. As it turns out, they work just fine in the JV machine and both the regular and flavored coffees, though not necessarily "gourmet" stuff, are really quite tasty.  I would have no problem serving this coffee to a guest in my home

This is the Melitta Pod that I make sure is heavily stocked in my kitchen.  While the others taste fine, I prefer this for the bold flavor and stronger dose of caffeine.  4 starts because of inconsistent quality - most of my pods have tasted good, but a few seem a bit stale at times

Bob's Red Mill Soy Protein Powder is a low-cost, versatile source of protein.  It has negligible fat and no cholesterol, has a neutral taste and odor, and mixes well with the foods with which I have tried it.  I have been using it more or less daily for approximately 1 month.  

At breakfast I mix 2 tablespoons with 1-1/2 cups of milk, 1 tablespoon of nutritional yeast and 1 tablespoon of blackstrap molasses.  The mixture is highly nutritious and tastes surprisingly good.

I also add 2-4 tablespoons of it to approximately 2 quarts of mixed fresh and frozen veggies that I steam for lunch most days.  The protein powder takes on the taste of the veggies.

Down the road I anticipate that I will add it to beans and vegetarian chili to give additional protein to these foods also.

This salmon jerky is definitely tasty.  It has a slightly strong peppery taste to it, which I really like.
The previous reviewer was correct in thinking the jerky was a bit too dry and hard to chew.  It'll take you a while to bite a piece off and chew it.  My jaws were too tired to even eat a whole serving.
Nonetheless, the jerky is quite tasty so I'm not dissapointed.
These come in eight resealable pounches, each with 2 ounces of salmon jerky.  I'm sure these will last a while since it'll take a while to chew them all up

This California style salmon jerky tastes great, but a little overly dry and hard to chew, in my opinion. Still it is nice to have, and it is very funny to see looks on people faces when you offer them salmon, somewhere on a trip in the middle of nowhere.

This coffee tastes great when brewed in my pod coffee maker.  I especially like the packaging.  Since each pod is individually wrapped, the coffee is always fresh no matter how long after I open the box.  For me, the benefit of a pod coffee maker is that I can make a single cup on a weekend and then not make coffee again for another week. I was unpleasantly surprised to find that some pod coffee is not separately wrapped, which means it becomes stale rather quickly after the packages is opened. Thanks to this coffee's packaging, I can enjoy fresh coffee with every pod - not just the first one or two pods in the package

My experience with gluten-free breads goes back over 22 years.  This is the best gluten free bread I've found for toasting.  It actually turns a nice shade of brown in the toaster without burning.  Good flavor and consistency.  I add butter, cinnamon and sugar or peanut butter to mine..  keeps very well in the fridge

I buy a case of these or the cocoa variety whenever Amazon features them on the Friday Sale -- generally about six dollars less than the listed $22.00.  The 5 ounce packages are paper reinforced cylinders, easy to pack and easy to open, great for a take-along treat.  (The packs don't re-close, however, so you pretty much have to devour all contents once opened.)  For Christmas I made up small gift baskets using these, a coffee mug or two, and some instant cappucino.

I got in on the cookies a few weeks ago from Bahlsen that had the chocolate filling. They are wonderful cookies and at less than $1 a pack you cannot go wrong. These things were made for a quick coffee or milk dunk. Don't let them soak as the light cookie will fall apart, but a quick dip sets them up just fine!  They come well packed and wrapped. Recommended highly

I RESERVE 5 STARS FOR FRESH-BAKED COOKIES. THIS 4 STAR COOKIE CONSISTS OF TWO LIGHT CRISPY WAFERS WITH A CHOCOLATEY TASTE REMINISCENT OF BROWNIES...NOT DARK CHOCOLATE... AND IN BETWEEN, A LIGHT CREAMY FILLING...NOT AT ALL LIKE THE DENSE OREO FILLING. THEY WOULD COMPLEMENT ICE CREAM NICELY. NOT TOO MANY NOW

If you've ever had as Bahlsen Hit cookies (normally a plain cookie with chocolate filling) you'll know these have to be good.  A creamy center that can easily be eaten separatly by nibbling off the cookie top and bottom.  A dry cookie that isn't too sweet but full of flavor.

Great for a mid-day snack.  I always have a roll in my desk draw at work.

Very Very Tasty

I've been drinking Pura Vida coffee ever since I heard a recent Harvard MBA tell us of his efforts to cut out the large middleman profits in the coffee business so that the coffee growere could realise a better life.  The bonus is that it is really good coffee!  I look for the gourmet coffees and Pura vida is one of them.  Thanks for such a good product, easily shopped for and for the chance to help "the little guy".

I first purchased this coffee because I recently decided to go a little more organic.  Let me tell you, this stuff is amazing!  The taste is much cleaner and fresher than Starbucks, which is what we used to use.  Actually, we ran out at one point and bought a bag of Starbucks, and neither me nor my husband liked the Starbucks as we did before!

And, proceeds go to coffee-producing countries.  So, you getting great coffee at a better price than Starbucks, and you are contributing back to less fortunate people in coffee-producing countries.  What could be better

I had been looking for a new source of whole bean coffees with a rich taste. In this sampler I found a new favorite, the Ethiopia Sidamo. It was a nice medium-dark roast with a rich, winey flavor that I loved. The Columbian was also a nice coffee. On the other hand, the Sumatra had an almost burned taste that was very acidic. The beans were fresher than many that I buy off-the-shelf and they are definitely a better value than the Gevalia that I have been receiving. These are a full 12-ounce

Pura Vida Kilamanjaro has absolutely spoiled my wife and I to coffee. Starbuck's doesn't even match it's taste and knowing that Pura Vida does such great humanitarian work in the coffee growing countries only adds to its value. If you like bold coffee I highly recommend Pura Vida Kilamanjaro! It's now the only bean in our house

If you are looking for a premium dark roast coffee this is it. Not only are you getting a dark, full bodied coffee but it's fair-trade and organic as well. Think about it, you get an amazing cup of coffee every morning and the coffee farmer in Indonesia and Ethiopia (the sources of Cake K) are receiving a fair, living wage for their labors. One of the best if not the best coffees that I have ever drank, I recommend everyone try it once because thats all it will take for you to become hooked on it.

I just got my box of 250 from Amazon this week and already love it. It is much more like sugar than even Splenda and I have loved Splenda for years. It is not as sweet as Splenda. It lets you taste the coffee or tea flavor and not just taste sweetness. I had not realized what I have been missing. I also noticed that after my morning coffee I feel much more satisfied for a longer time. I feel good that it is all natural...I get enough chemicals and over processed foods..who needs more? Try it you will not be disappointed. It will open a whole new world of flavor to you

I just received my box of Sun Crystals and I can not rave enough about this product.  I have never tasted a low calorie sweetener that is as close to the flavor of sugar in my life.  I am a big time Splenda fan, but this has a smoother taste to it...although not quite as powerful as Splenda.  I use 2 packets in a coffee normally and it is the perfect amount of sweetness without being overpowering.  Using one packet in tea is just enough sweetness to take the bite off the stronger teas, but not ruin the flavor of high end teas.  

Being all natural, I feel like it must be healthier for me and my family than other low calories sweeteners.  This is the only one I actually feel ok giving to my children.  I recommend this product highly to anyone who uses low calories sweetener.  

Don't forget to type in the $5 discount code

I received a sample of Sun Crystals, tried it and loved it.  I have ordered a container of 250 packets from Amazon.    I hope that it becomes available in our local grocery stores soon.  I just wanted everyone to know that the taste is so much like full-calorie sugar that it is amazing even though there are only 4 calories per packet!  The consistency is also just like full-calorie sugar.  There is no artificial aftertaste like some of the other low-calorie sweeteners as it is all natural.  I highly recommend this new product.

I purchased this item from Amazon and expected 6 boxes of 20 bags. I got one box of 20 bags. I complained. When the man I spoke to said they would just send it again, I was thinking that they would send me 5 boxes, but they sent me 1 box in the second order. I guess this is just one box of 20 tea bags for the price. I do really like the tea though. It makes excellent iced tea and hot tea. So if you want 1 box for the price, puchase this item.

This is the best tasting shortbread cookie in my book. 
Since I am unable to eat wheat it is a rare find to discover an excellent cookie...or any other wheat-free product. After I purchased my first box at a local health food store, I went online to see where I could buy more. I now purchase these cookies in bulk...at 3-4 cases at once...and they stay fresh until the next order.

Thank you Pamela...wherever you are!

These will satisfy the craving for gingerbread.  When you bite into them, you'll immediately know you're in for a treat.  The eating experience alone hits the reward center of the brain.  Soft, dense and chewy describe the cookie's character.  The rich flavor of molasses provides depth to the tasting experience.  Shredded Ginger gives the cookie a distinct texture and kick to the palate.  One cookie can satisfy the worst craving for carbs.  All the Pamela cookies are delicious, but this one could be a dessert all on its own

If you do not eat gluten, and you love peanut butter cookies, you HAVE to try these cookies! They are so superly delicious! They are somewhat crumbly in the box, and at least one cookie in every box will be broken into pieces. But they are so good you will not even care! Definitely try them, you'll love them

Guys, you really should get these little green spirulina-ginseng balls!  My two college kids practically beg to get them! :-)  My husband and I also love to have a few with us on trips.  Great snacks. Great taste compared to a lot of healthfood snacks. Clean and green and healthy for you!

We actually put BETTY LOU'S SPIRULINA-GINSENG BALLS in our Christmas Stockings this year and everyone cheered!

Do yourself a favor. Buy the big canister. They are tons cheaper this way and you won't run out as fast

I just bought a box since its so much cheaper than getting single ones, usually 1$ + each.  1. they are healthy and vegan, 2. i leave a box of em at work for breakfast, quick and easy. 3. the taste is on the good level compared to healthy snack bars, taste like nuts and rasins, n a bit of the green stuff, but its fine if u usually eat things like this. It is moist n chewy. Overall, I like the taste and will buy more

I thought they would taste like algae or grass but they did NOT! Deliciously nutty and filling at only 150 calories! I used to drag through my morning at work.. I ate one of my coworkers' because it was the only food available. Amazing. Yummy and energizing.. and after one, I wasn't hungry for the rest of the afternoon

Finding a quick, nutritious, satisfying vegan treat is no small feat!  This is it...I always have an emergency ginseng ball in my purse, just in case I get the munchies when I'm out and about in the big, bad junk food world we live in.  And THIS is the way to buy them!  Less than HALF of what Whole Foods charges...
I shouldn't be telling you all this...I never want amazon to be "sold out" when I come looking for my ginseng ball fix.  Never mind.  They're awful.  Don't buy them

I bought these because I have a corn allergy and wanted to substitute them for the LA Weightloss bars that list corn syrup as the first ingredient.  I was pleasantly surprised that they were pretty tasty! My favorites are actually the Fudgie Filberts that taste similar to a Little Debbie brownie if Little Debbie's were diet. Following that I would say Almond and Coconut are tied for second. Third is the Peanut Butter which is the highest in protein but not as good as the others. My husband didn't like any of them but could tolerate the one I liked least, Peanut Butter.  Over all I think these are great as a healthy snack for people with food allergies or other dietary restrictions. I think I would have picked a different name than Betty Lou's Nut Butter Balls.  Nut Butter Balls doesn't sound as appetizing as what they actually are!! Nut Butter Balls.....Mmmmmm

I've loved gummi bears since I was a kid, and back then I didn't care so much if they were hard to chew, like Haribo's brand. These are great gummi bears, as they are easy to chew and taste sweet but not over whelmingly. I eat them all the time at work, if they are available. I love them and haven't been able to find them in the stores around here, so I'm glad that Amazon has made them available.

I've only tried the sunflower cheese crackers - I stumbled upon them in an organic food store - and I'm addicted. As a vegetarian, sometimes I struggle to find healthy snacks, but these are great. One cracker is about the size of a slice of bread, but much more dense (and filling). They're very crunchy and flavorful.Since they're also USDA Organic, you can eat them with a good conscience, knowing that your support of organic products means they're healthier for you, healthier for the environment and healthier for the farmers.
Though a bit pricy, I highly recommend them

I have tried this flavor along with the Klassic 3-seed, and the Seeded Spelt and I have loved everyone of them.  I find that they are a healthy snack to pair with yogart (for dipping) or with brie cheese and some fruit.  I cannot wait to try the Seedlander, Muesli, and the Graham although I have not been able to find those in any local stores

Spelt pretzels with fiber are hard to come by.  Organic to boot!  My family used to eat Vita Spelt until I realized there was no fiber in them and they weren't organic.  Much cheaper on Amazon than in Whole Foods

These cookies are nothing like the ones I ate when I was 11, at the lunch table while sitting next to Nancy. These Double Chocolate Chunk cookies are exquisitely kind to the senses, but bring no memory of my fifth grade dream girl. Her pleasant eyes would assuage a long morning's pain in Miss Charminker's class, but it was the meting of her chocolate chip cookies that met my heart.

Betty Crocker's cookies are worth sharing too, all of these years later. Made in the oven, they are almost like homemade, almost like the ones Nancy's mom made. Twelve come in the bag if you bake them right. The subtle, bright sweet aroma tinctured with the bold, yet faint milk chocolate scent, captured in a classic cookie enraptured my senses, as they will yours. But, still, the crusty stale, brown-white cookies Nancy shared with me in my youth caused me to smile far more, with a deeper gladdening. She'd lift them gingerly from her brown bag, place one precisely in front of me, on the table, and one in from of her, on the table. She would then proceed to excavate the treasures within, and side-by-side we would eat our lunches until the bell rang.
 
If you don't know Nancy or her equal, then I suggest you buy the Betty Crocker cookies. They'll taste better than most of the cookies you'll've eaten, and maybe you'll sit next to someone nice at lunch to share them with. Be sure to share. If you do, she might sit next to you tomorrow

The pods do fit in my Senseo machine and are as good-tasting -- which is not saying much, they're all quite weak  -- as the Senseo pods

No kidding!  This cereal is fabulous and I NEVER buy anything that says "organic" on it.  I initially picked this cereal up because I lost about 20 pounds on Weight Watchers last year and I am very careful about total calories versus grams of fiber.  I decided to try a box and loved it immediately.  My husband even likes it!  He swears that it tastes just like Wheaties but I think it is much better :)  I save over a dollar a box buy getting it on Amazon and I highly recommend it to everybody

We eat a lot of Orville Redenbacher Natural Light Popcorn--it is lightly salted, not full of butter, etc., taste great, and has to be better for us than most other popcorns on the market. Much easier to fix than popping the old time way.  The only local store that carried it switched to some off brand popcorn.  We were so pleased when we found it at Amazon.com--got it at a good price--and had free shipping.  Thank you Amazon!

Better than Wolff's Kasha. I grew up eating Kasha and it is an easy to prepare healthy meal. Bob's Red Mill has a great selection of all things GRAIN. If you are ever in the Portland area you should check out the store/restaurant. Great vegetarian selections as well as meat eater stuff.

Some of the other Yogi green teas, like the one with echinacea, taste kind of bad to me, but I really like the antioxidant one. Not sure if it's actually anti-aging...that's a pretty bold claim...but it's nice! Mildly caffeinated so it gives me some energy without making me wired. And it's good plain or with milk or even milk and sugar, if you want to make it more like a dessert

This penne pasta is great.  Tastes as good, or better, than most wheat pastas.  Other non-celiac people can't tell it's gluten-free.  

I will most likely buy from this brand again; they are good and pretty cheap here on Amazon

This is a great product at a great price.  The light, amber colored nectar reminds me of butterscotch and the darker variety is more like maple syrup.  Both blend easily in liquids and taste great on cream of rice cereal.  It's low on the glycemic  index and doesn't require much

Never heard of it. Did some research and decided to try it. Extremely satisfied with my choice! I went for the "Light" version since my research mentioned that it was the one with no strong after-taste. Much better, natural choice than artificial sweeteners. Does have calories, but the glycemic index response is very good; translation: it doesn't give you that "sugar rush". I like things fairly sweet, so I use 2-3 teaspoons per cup of coffee. You may need less. DEFINITELY get the 12 pack!!! Best value and you'll be amazed at how much you start using it!

I could not believe how good this nectar tastes.  I was expecting it to have an aftertaste or be bitter, like most artificial sweeteners.  I was pleasantly surprised at first taste.  I then had my husband taste it because he doesn't like artificial sweeteners, and he loved it, too!  It will come in handy on the Perricone Weight Loss diet, because of it's low glycemic index.  The price for the case here on Amazon is really good, too, so I'm stocking up.  

If you are a diabetic, this is the best tasting sweetener with the lowest glycemic index out there right now

My search for a non-bitter (stevia), non-artificial, non-refined sugar sweetner is over at last!  I hesitated to buy this because of the requirement to buy 12.  Boy, am I glad I did buy the whole box!  We use this in everything, including baking, and find that it has a really good taste.  Most sweetners ruin the taste of our fine coffees, but the agave simply supplies sweetness.  We'll be trying the amber agave next in hopes of a heartier sweetness for winter baked goods

Have you ever described a food as tasting "healthy" when you mean it tastes so bad it must be good for you? Fear not! It is pleasantly adaptable to use with any fruit on hand. I honestly will say, though, that it does have an earthy quality. It may take the uninitiated some getting acquainted with--just a little! If trying for the first time, I heartily recommend trying the Hemp Goddess Supreme recipe on the jar's label. Surprisingly palatable! You'll be proud to have done something nourishing and healthy for yourself. Easy to digest. The powder is indeed rather coarse. When you find it'll tide you over very well until your next meal, you won't mind. Including this in one's eating habits can only be an addition for the positive

I was having blood sugar spikes and after adding Nutiva's hemp protein to my smoothies, I can cruise for a good 3 hours without hunger or spiking.  This has been a godsend. I chose Nutiva because a few die-hard friends will use nothing else.  Plus I am a Californian, and like that it's made here. I tried a few other products over the months and keep coming back to Nutiva.  I just like it best, and Organic is really important to me.

This is my favorite gluten free cereal hands down. Let's face it- it isn't nutritious. This is not a health cereal. But thank goodness! It also won't send you in absolute sugar shock, either- and I love the peanut butter flavor. It's a good light snack for breakfast- and I bet it would be good in recipes too.

I love this cereal! I'm a 30 year old cereal lover and this stuff is great. I can't take the real sweet stuff like I used to, and with only 6 grams of sugar per serving (plus some fiber!), I often eat two bowls at a time as a "treat"!  Don't let the nutrition label fool you - it's great tasting stuff.  Goes awesome with sliced banana and holds up very well in milk

I have been an avid senseo fan for about a year.  However, I was getting a bit bored drinking the same Dark Roast every morning (I found the other flavors too mild).  So I was very happy when I saw the new flavors  (Sumatra, Colombia, Kenya and Brazil).  After trying all of them, this is my close second favorite

We were glad to see that Amazon started carrying this Colombia Blend. After discovering it in Europe and bringing several pacakges over, we later had some shipped to us from family in Belgium.
This has a good strong taste and I particularly like it in the morning.
Recommended for any Senseo lover tired of the regular blends found in the retails stores

At last, a product where I have complete control over what ingredients I can use and have versatility of what shakes/drinks I make. No need to worry about artificial ingredients and sweetners. You can make just about any concoction with this protein powder, and make it 100% natural!

Bottom line, if you want to control what you put in your body, you must get this!

This is nutritious, flavorful, jaw and teeth friendly snack for the  person that wants a pleasant tasting meaty between the meals boost.  A change from the standard nothing can destroy it, not even you, jerky (a required item for some activities) but usually not for the normal environments in which we function most of the time.

I love licorice but cant eat wheat, which is in most licorice candies, so I was soooooo happy to find this! I would buy again. I bought a "case" and it won't be going to waste!  Besides, licorice is good for circulation and better than other candies... 
P.S. Not too sweet either! Not bland, definitely, but I liked its reasonable sweetness

I don't like water.  I know I'm supposed to drink it, but I just don't like it.  I have tried most of the powdered drink mixes and this is the only one that I really like.  I actually crave it.  I drink more water now than at any time in my life because it tastes good.  I honestly can't believe that this is a diet drink.  Zero carbs, 5 calories, and great taste, what more could you want?

I am a huge fan of Ruth's Hemp Protein Powders, in this blend with Flax and Maca you get a ton of great nutrients and the boost of Maca (which is a good energy source).  I use this with 10oz of almond milk, 5-6 frozen strawberries and a 1/2 frozen banana (Blended up in my Vitamix).  The only thing about this powder is that it does have a distinct taste, I like it but some may not. If you do find you like the taste, you'll be hard pressed to find a better protein powder on the market!

At first I was leery about buying food, because there was no nututritional info in the description. These have 11 carbs and 1 gram of prorein, just like the brand in my supermarket. They are made with organic rice and taste great. 

I saved a whole $1 per bag on these and with Amazon Prime, shiping was free! Needless to say, I reordered when the first case was gone

I am low carb for life due to health issues.  The one thing that I miss most in my low carb life style is crispy,crunch.  These crackers are amazing.  They are so crunchy and taste fantastic and while they would not work on a very low carb diet, they work just fine as an occasional "treat" in a low carb life style.  They have a very nutty flavor and you can actually see the various seeds they contain, in other words, they are real, whole grain crackers.  I am hooked

The Dr. Kracker Flatbread, Seed Spelt are not only healthy, but taste great and are very crunchy. I gave some to my daughter and she liked them enough to buy herself a case. Also, these crackers are very filling relative to the amount of carbohydrates they contain. Amazon sells these for much less than the health food stores so the price is amazing

Thank you for providing a superior product Mr Bob of Red Mill and Amazon

When I lived on the border of England and Wales, I had a roommate from Copenhagen Denmark, and he got some of this in his Christmas goodie basket from his Mom. At first it is a shock to the system, and I was the only American in the house that didn't spit it out. Soon I was bugging him to get his Mom to send more. It is a testament to the impression that it made that 25 years later I checked Amazon to see if I could get it here.

Before I got home my wife and kids had gotten into the box and tried it. They didn't try a second piece. I however after the initial shock of the first piece, remembered why I liked it. And although this case will probably last me a long time, I do rather enjoy the flavor. But be warned the flavor is HEAVY on the salt and very light on the sweet. Not for the low sodium diet alt all. But it is a treat that you can enjoy without emptying the whole container in a sitting and wonder where it went. So... if you are adventurous, or if you remember the taste from your European adventures, try this exotic treat.

Celestial Seasonings makes great tea-bagged tea in visually and philosophically inspired packaging. The wellness assortment features five flavors of four bags each in separate interior envelopes. It's a great way to have several styles of herbal refreshment available without a lot of open packages around. Great value for the money at Amazon prices, too

They taste like those little bits of cheese that melt out of a grilled cheese sandwhich and get a little burnt by the griddle.   I think they taste great...but they do have a bit of sodium in them..

Only reason this item gets a 4 is because of the price. I can get this for $1.69 in my local store - and even cheaper when I have coupons (can't do that with amazon!). Otherwise, my family loves this version of organic mac 'n cheese (wish they made the larger size!). My 7 yr old doesn't mind the little green flecks - he knows they are the "special" tasty ingredient and now isn't as squeemish to see green bits in other items

This is a tasty product, unlike some of the gluten-free foods that I have tried.  It is very crunchy with lots of fruit and nuts.  It has plenty of calories, but I use it as a topping for other, less-tasty cereals, e.g. bran flakes or some of the high-fiber cereals that remind me of twigs and leaves.  I will definitely be ordering more in the future

I was recently at a very nice restaurant for dinner and this was the coffee they served. It was very rich and delicious. We raved about it so much that our server gave us some of the beans to take home. I've been addicted ever since. This is by far the best price I've been able to find

After having Illy at the espresso bars in Italy, well, no other espresso tasted good to me! Illy tastes great made in a good pump espresso machine. It also tastes great made in a steam espresso machine (e.g., a low end Krups) and a Moka (an Italian poor-man's espresso maker). The rich flavor isn't burnt tasting like many espresso roasts. Everyone I've made an Illy espresso for raves over the flavor compard to espresso from chain coffee stores. 

A tip when brewing espresso using a steam espresso machine:  Shut off the valve before any steaem comes through the coffee.  The high temperature steam will leach unwanted flavors into the coffee.

I used to buy Illy at the local stores, but the prices were over $11 per can, sometimes $12. I was happy to see Amazon start carrying it at an even lower price. 

If you can't find Illy a good runner-up is Lavazza, however, its flavor isn't as intense as Illy

I was already a fan of Numi's Morning Rise and Monkey King Jasmine teas, but their Gunpowder Green tea is an absolute standout. Sure, it's in a teabag, but you can see that there is 'real' tea in there, not just tea dust. You will not be disappointed with this tea

I became a fan of green tea when my Navy duties took me to Japan and Korea.  In Japan, particularly, I learned a little about the differences in green teas (shade-grown, finely ground, and so on).  Since returning to my land-locked home in the Rockies, the only good green tea I've been able to get my hands on has been through mail order.  (If you're drinking Lipton brand green tea and have judged green tea accordingly, you really are missing out...)

This is the first green tea in a bag (as opposed to loose leaf) that really reminds me of the good teas I had in Japan.  At work, I don't make time to pre-heat my tea pot and my tea cups and brew it "properly," so I really appreciate a delicious tea in the convenience of a bag, and if you like green tea, I'm certain you'll like this one!

***** 
Temple of Heaven Gunpowder Green Tea is a premium Numi tea. It is a low-caffeine green tea, is certified organic, and is kosher. 

On the box, the manufacturer says it better than I ever could: "Our whole leaf Temple of Heaven - Gunpowder Green Tea is gently steamed within hours of being plucked, then skillfully hand rolled into small tight pearls. This process preserves its delicate flavor and aroma far longer than other green teas. Steeped in hot water, the leaves unfurl, releasing a well-rounded, full-bodied flavor. Rich in fluoride, calcium, and anti-oxidants - and with very little caffeine - this is a perfect choice to greet the evening."

The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love green tea, or want a green tea that you can drink in the evening, I do not think you could find a better source than Numi.

Please realize that these are not cookies as much as crackers.  They have a sweet taste, but don't expect an oreo as the taste of hazelnut is much more subtle than other tastes.

These cookies normally cost $1.50 to $2.00 per package in food specialty stores.  I love them but I resisted when I was shopping for Christmas.  BUT, when I saw them for 25 packages for $12.00 with free shipping - I caved.  OK- they are not low fat but one splurge a year won't kill us.

I have been using Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil since December.  I used to buy it at the heatlh food store by my home, however after receiving the great deal on Amazon I will continue to buy it here.  Since I have been using Nutiva Coconut Oil my skin is glowing and I feel better all over.  I use it as a daily moisturizer on my skin after my showers and I drink 2 tablespoons daily.  I have a very hardy, healthy appetite and eat alot.  For the amount of food I eat I should weigh more than I do.  I believe that the Coconut Oil helps you maintain a healthy weight.  I am so glad I found out about Coconut Oil and I will continue to use it forever.  Thank you

I have been studying the benefits of coconut oil for some time. I tried several different brands but when I opened a jar of the Nutiva I knew that I had found what I was looking for. Absolutely the freshest most wonderful organic virgin coconut oil on the planet. 

I substituted the butter and/or vegetable oil in several recipes with the Nutiva coconut oil and achieved incredible results. I even fried eggs in it last night and they were GREAT! I will never fry with any other oil again. I also use it as a spread on toast, bagels, and muffins.

AAAAA+++++  Try it, you'll love it!

Amazon delivered exactly what I ordered and on time. For me, Nutiva VCO is a great alternative to unhealthy cooking oils. If we compare short-chain fatty acids (such as the lauric chains in coconut oil) which are metabolized within the mitochondria of cells, versus longer chain-bearing oils which require conjugation and transport to the liver, I think VCO must be healthier for me overall.  Nutiva also tastes good and frankly people, it's a great lotion. Yes, it takes a few minutes to sink in, but once it does, you have soft skin.

Virgin coconut oil is great for your health and taste buds. 
I tried several different brands. I like this one a lot.
I am not a big fan of coconut flavor, but this one smells different. It's preasant.

Just 54-ounce jar was too big. I didn't have a sense of US unit. I recommend smaller jars if you don't bake often.

You'll enjoy this oil as a substitution of butter and also you can use as your natural skin cream

I bought these because my husband loved the Just Blackberries so much.  We both agree: These are great!!!  He eats them as a snack between meals, I put them in yoghurt - yum!  If you love berries, these are a wonderful alternative when they are out of season

Another reviewer called this a "genetically engineered horror" (and the same review gave high ratings to Poptarts!- not that they taste bad, but they are pretty high in sugar and artificial stuff). I believe the name of the company is "Just Tomatoes" with the name of the product being "Just Rasberries". Freeze dried fruit is hardly a genetically engineered horror. It is JUST RASBERRIES-nothing else added and very good in taste and very healthy. I like the rasberries and the strawberries best. I have used them in my cereal, as a snack out of the box, in yougurt and in smoothies. If you like to have certain fruits when they are not in season and don't care for frozen, these will fit the bill

The product didn't taste like your typical brownie, but it was very chocolatey and very tastey. The consistency was rather dense and chewy, as opposed to cake-like. Wholesome ingredients and being a healthy alternative to typical junk food are what make Pure Chocolate Brownie Bars a four star product. This is more like a health food brownie. If I can eat healthy brownies, all the better! I plan to purchase more

This bar is the closest thing I've ever experienced to eating a brownie fresh from the oven in a packaged food.  I have no idea how the folks at Pure Bar managed to make a chocolate bar that tastes so much like baked goods, using only raw and living ingredients, but it's wonderful that they have, and I mean to buy several more cases.  Any of the store bought brownies you've had won't satisfy you like this will - Entemanns and Hostess are not nearly as delicious and warm-tasting, and the health food and energy bars I've had that are chocolate flavored always end up tasting like wheat germ or oats.  It's easy to carry, one bar fills me up, and as a chocolate fan, I am happy to see that Pure Bar uses raw cacao powder - the real deal, and not carob chocolate substitutes.  You can definitely taste the difference.  This particular Pure Bar product makes for the best tasting snackfood or dessert I've ever eaten out of a wrapper, and unless you're on a completely raw vegan diet, it's going to be better for you than whatever meal you ate just beforehand!  If you like chocolate like I do, you're going to love this.  It's a soft, gooey brownie, pure and simple, walnuts and all

I love ESE pods.  I know some coffee snobs disagree, but I'll take 90% of the taste for 10% of the work any day.  As for pods, I've had Starbucks, Illy, and Espressione Arabica.  I like the Espressione the best.  I lived in Italy for 3 years and hit the coffee bars daily - I know what I like in espresso.  The Starbucks was a bit too rough, too American tasting.  Suprisingly, though, the Starbucks pods tasted just like an espresso at one of their stores.  Very consistent.  The Illy is too smooth.  It goes well with food, and after dinner, but I tend to take my espresso at breakfast, and prefer a bold, smooth taste.  The Espressione Arabica achieves just that.  I'll be buying it again for my every day use

These pods have got to be the best invention yet. They are compact, extremely easy to use & is the best solution to making several very quick cups of coffee. 

Fresh ground coffee is nice, but there is virtually no mess with these pods. The crema is just as good as ground coffee & these can be used in a pod holder as well as a one cup filter basket.
What more could a person want?!

I have enjoyed those pods for more than a year with my Frances Frances Espresso machine, but today I am a little bit concerned about the fact that your price went from $37.99 last month to $60.00 today... Why? The advantage of buying 150 pods at once was to cut down on the price, if it is the same price or more expensive than other stores, do we still have a reason to purchase them from Amazon? Please enlighten me! I would be very sorry to have to go elsewhere. Thanks

I use the regular Sleepytime frequently in the evenings, but on those nights when you need a little something extra, this stuff is amazing. Its very nice when travelling and you are having a hard time sleeping in a strange bed.  I don't like taking medications (no Lunestra for me) but with this, don't need to.

I've had difficulty falling asleep since my college days.  Once I entered my mid-30's the insomnia became more frequent.  Melatonin and valerian pills did not work unless taken at levels that left me with a morning hangover effect. L-Tryptophan, 5-HTP, and GABA were ineffective. I have also tried numerous prescription (sleep is necessary to get through nursing school) and OTC medications that are used to treat insomnia.  Most left me with a headache or excessive daytime sleepiness (zombie mode).  I first tried Sleepytime Extra (Sleepytime and other chamomile teas do not work for me)about 6 weeks ago, and each time I drink it I become sleepy within 15 minutes.  Celestial Seasonings Sleepytime Extra works like a charm!  The 25mg of Valerian root works synergistically with the chamomile and tilia estrella.  I'm stocking up before the FDA comes down on valerian like it did kava kava.  I also recommend 30-60 minutes of sunlight in a.m. hours, because many people are unaware that they have DSPS (Delayed Sleep Phase Insomnia)

I use to take valarian root pill before I went to bed, but always felt it was a little too sedating. With this tea, it's a lot milder (the differance is like a Lullaby vs. a sledge hammer). It also has a nice aroma, bouquet, and flavor. I like to mix this with blueberry, or (when I'm under the weather) Echenacia tea (Celestials wellness tea)

The tea works like a dream.  It relaxes me just enough to go to sleep and I don't wake up feeling drugged.  Works much better than valerian capsules.

If you love lemons and even if you don't think you do- you will love this drink! It is so crisp and refreshing chilled. Yes, it has sugar, but what fruit juice or fruit for that matter doesn't? If you don't drink soda like me and are kinda burnt on water- try essn's juices. Lemon and a little vodka make a great cocktail, too. They're a little pricey, but quality products usually are. It's also great to get it delivered to my door and save the trip to the store

These are great snacks for traveling, such as, by airplane or car.   The cookie comes in the shape of a small cracker.  The cracker is less messy than a cookie which can break apart and crumble; and for this reason a preferred treat.

The texture is comparable to a medium crunchy chip and very light to eat.   The first response by most people when eating the cracker for the first time is, "Humm these are good!"   This is a pleasant response and these crackers will probably be a big success over time

I was pleased to be able to order this Bisquick mix because the stores in our area no longer carry it.  We love these honey flavored bisquits, but will be hard pressed to use all 22 before the expiration date. I ordered them in the middle of March and they have a June expiration date. It would be good if the expiration date was longer or if it was given in the product description

My husband never cared much for my homemade biscuits. I didn't make them often enough to really get it right like my mother and grandmother used to do. Then I tried the Betty Crocker Bisquick Mix and WOW what a difference it made. We like the rolled method better than the drop, but either way these are easy, quick and consistently great biscuits. As good a true southern biscuit as even my grandmother used to make! My husband is now a very happy man when I make his favorite sausage gravy & biscuits breakfast

This is worth trying.  I enjoy this when I need chocolate or a desert and haven't had time to bake.  It's yummy alone or dunked in coffee.  It is more dense than traditional wheat Biscotti so it did take eating two or three before I fully enjoyed having this as a desert or treat option.  I give this ready made sweet treat a thumbs up for the gluten intolerant

I have been a big fan of Celestial Seasonings since the 1980s, when a friend drank the different blends and I tried one.  My husband drinks this faithfully every night, and I sometimes drink some of his. I do have one complaint, though small:  when I drink a full cup, it sends me to the bathroom a couple of times in the night.  

I also notice that it does not interfere with my or my husband's medications; that is a big concern among alot of people and medical community.  Everyone reacts differently, I know; if you want to buy one box and try a few drinks of it each night or every other night, if you are on prescriptions like we are(we are only baby boomers,not old people), I would do it that way.  

In a previous review from someone who sweetens it, I think that would ruin the whole taste and aroma of the SleepyTime.  Give it time and it will grow on you

Ah, it's a definite American story - in 1969 friends Mo Siegel and Wyck Hay of Colorado began selling the herbal teas that they had previously only made for themselves. From such small beginnings came that famous tea company - Celestial Seasonings.

Among Celestial Seasonings' many products is Sleepytime, an herbal infusion that has such a wonderfully different taste that I have been able to win my wife over to it, and she does not consider herself to be a tea drinker. Many are the evenings when I will brew up some Sleepytime to go along with my famous spiced bread!

Anyway, Sleepytime is largely a mixture of chamomile and spearmint, which produces a healthy drink that has a wonderful aroma and taste. I'm sure that I cannot adequately describe the taste - it doesn't taste like anything you've ever tried before, but its seductive flavors will win you over.

If I could make one suggestion to Celestial Seasonings, it would be to change the name to something else. I've had friends refuse to try it, afraid that the tea will make them feel drowsy. You can buy Sleepytime with Valerian root, which definitely promotes sleepiness, but the regular product is just a pleasant herbal drink. I suppose it's called Sleepytime because its fresh spearmint tastes very good late in the evening, and its natural lack of caffeine means that it won't keep you awake. But, this is a wonderful product that tastes great at any time of the day!

By the way, it also makes a unique, zingy iced tea

Sleepytime is a popular tea that has been around a long time due to its high quality. The natural flavors and ingredients have made it a required tea for the cupboard of persons interested in healthy eating for the last 30 years! The predominant flavors are of chamomile and spearmint--but the additional ingredients--including rose buds--create a satisfying, complex blend that is very tasty and soothing. Not only is Sleepytime caffeine-free but it contains herbs that are mildly relaxing and healing for the stomach. Drink this lovely tea before bed either with or without honey.

Sleepytime contains chamomile, spearmint, lemongrass, tilia flowers, blackberry leaves, orange blossoms, hawthorne berries and rosebuds. The healing qualities of some the herbs in Sleepytime are listed below, however please note that there is insufficient quantities of each herb to have anything more than a very mild effect. Blackberry leaves, which are soothing to the stomach, contain tannins which provides a tea-like base for the flowery flavors of chamomile and rosebuds. Spearmint is one of the milder mints and is also useful to soothe tummy ache. Chamomile is a wonderful herb that has a relaxing effect; it also can be used to soothe tummy aches, headache, menstrual cramps and is a mild anti-fungal.

Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.

Quote from the box:

"Ultimately, the bond of all companionship, whether in marriage or friendship, is conversation." Oscar Wilde

We were glad to see that Amazon started carrying this Kenya Blend. After discovering it in Europe and bringing several pacakges over, we later had some shipped to us from family in Belgium.
This has a nice subtle yet defined taste and I particularly like it in the afternoon with a cookie (covered in Belgian chocolate!) or biscotti.
Recommended for any Senseo lover tired of the regular blends found in the retails stores

I actually drink this cold.  I brew an entire pitcher of it (hot) and then put it in the fridge to enjoy as a cold beverage.  This tea has a nice mango (not overpowering) flavor and is both refreshing and crisp.  I have yet to try a Bentley's tea that I haven't enjoyed, so I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this flavor, or Bentley's in general!  Good Stuff

If you like a thin crust pizza, these will work for you! They hold the toppings well, and taste great. I tried (and failed) many times to make my own pizza crust. This is worth the price, if you must have pizza. I froze the other pizza shells, and they always turn out great. (Just sit out & thaw for about 30 mins before adding toppsing & cooking.

Rarely can I say that a GF product tastes better than the gluten version.  Thse cookies do, though.  Melt in your mouth delicious, and just the right amount of lemon.  I am confident tht if you gave these to gluten eaters, they would not be able to tell the difference

I feel like have tried every gluten-free baked good out there. Since I am allergic to dairy, eggs, soy, and bananas as well this product is a lifesaver for when I need a cookie. They taste really , really good and don't make me sick.  I love these things I pray they never stop making them.

These are high-quality pilchard sardines wild-caught from Morocco and contain 2g of heart-healthy Omega-3 fatty acids per can.  They are boneless and skinless and ready-to-eat.  My favorite way of eating sardines is crushed with some extra virgin olive oil and hot sauce (Jamaican pickapeppa sauce is ideal), on top of crackers.  Buying a whole case of 25 cans is much more economical than buying individual cans of comparable quality at our local supermarket.  We're very happy that Amazon sells these sardines

The tea is very good. The box looks to be made of plywood but is reasonably attractive, solid and functional. If the box would have had a veneer over the plywood or something along those lines then this would have been 5 stars. As it is I am very pleased with what I got considering how reasonably priced it was

Be aware, the list of ingredients contains nether pomegranate or blackberry. I am also not sure putting amino acids in a drink is such a grand idea. We get all amino acids we need from proteins, anyway.

In my opinion, this soda does not taste very natural. However, it does appear to be a healthier alternative to regular sugar-loaded carbonated drinks.

Everything that one could want in a boxed 'Macaroni & Cheese' meal is in this excellent product from 'Annie's Homegrown'. Its ingredients are 'Certified Organic', with real cheese and whole wheat pasta. The rusult is a very healthy fast-food that tastes significantly better, creamier, richer and more satisfying than its processed counterpart and WITHOUT COSTING THAT MUCH MORE

This is fast food that tastes great.  It really is pretty close to the real thing and tastes like "comfort food".  The noodles aren't mushy.  The cheese sauce is creamy & flavorful.  I like to add some extra cheese.  I also add veggies or a can of tuna now & then.  Makes for a very quick meal.  The organic and non-organic varieties taste exactly the same.

Great tasting organic product!  I have been on a somewhat organic diet since I was a child.  My parents always had an organic garden and now I have one.  My son also loves organic food and this was a great alterative to regular store brands.  

Adding organic sour cream or extra cheese to it just enhances the taste.  Amazon is a great way to purchase this product if you do not have a Fresh Market or a health food store in your area.

We've been looking for a good French Roast that is also Fair Trade and preferably Organic.  But the others we have tried have either not tasted as we expect (one was even chocolaty--not what we want in a French Roast) or just way too expensive.  This one tastes like a good French Roast coffee should, and it is even less expensive that the Starbucks I had been buying at Costco.  All that, and organic too!  We finally found the coffee we've been looking for

I had been getting the Starbucks French Roast coffee and enjoying it quite a bit.  However, I decided I would switch to organic coffe to avoid the unnatural stuff.  I must say I was not disappointed!  When I opened the package of coffee I found the beans fresh and oily.  Upon grinding and brewing them I found my tongue in a tastey coffe wonderland.  I'm hooked

Don't be fooled this is not you average Starbucks French Roast.  The roast is darker and the beans are oiler.  The roast is a little on the dark side for me but this is still good coffee.  

I have used it for drip and stove top espresso and it is fine for both.  As someone else mentioned the oily nature of the beans prevents them from free flowing through a burr grinder.

One strange thing is that there is no date on the bags.  No expiration date.  No roast date.  In fact there is no printed code or lot.  Who knows how old it is?  It is good that these purged bags do a good job of keeping coffee fresh while sealed. 

No can here just the usual coffee bag

I love the flavor of this French Roast, which isn't always what I go for, but the beans are so oily, they don't grind well in my burr grinder.  I've found that with other French Roast beans too, but none as difficult as these.  Maybe that's why they taste better than other French Roasts.  Overall, great,  high quality coffee

I bought this initially based only on its price since it worked out to a little over 5 dollars a pound.  Since I bought it the first time it has risen in price twice and is now about seven dollars a pound.  Still a good deal with free shipping but I can buy bulk boutique coffee for about 8 dollars a pound locally. As a result Amazon may lose a customer if they keep raising the price.
However it is an exceptional french roast much better than Starbucks product. Delivery has been fast and painless.

Besides espresso roast beans, french roast beans are my favorite.  Rocamojo does not disappoint.  I love opening a new bag of this coffee and smelling those beans and the way my whole house smells when I brew with them.  These are dark, oily beans.  These beans mean business.  The coffee tastes as good as it smells and makes a great dark rich strong tasting coffee with that beautiful french roast after taste that lasts on your palette the whole day.

You have to like dark roast coffees though to like these beans.  Just like you wouldn't order an IPA if you like Miller Lite.  These are the IPA of coffee beans.  Yum!

When people tell me "it tastes like the coffee shop"...I guess that's the ultimate critique.  Funny thing is I agree with them.  Great coffee  ROCK A MOJO!!  Looks like they varnish the beans they are so dark and shiny.
MMMMMMM good stuff

I originally bought these for my kids but they didn't seem to like it so I started eating them.  They are delicious and only 70 calories a bag. They make a perfect snack and it keeps me away from cookies, candies and other desserts. Yes, they are salted but are nowhere near as salty as potato chips or cheetoes.

These really taste great - I will order them again.  A nice snack item- and much crunchier than dried fruits and veggies I have eaten in the past.  Is it as yummy as chips?  No, but it is a decent substitute for a lot lower calories

I'd been ordering these for my family but decided to put a case out at my son's 6th birthday party. The kids gobbled them up and the moms came running to me in droves to ask where I got them. No one had a problem with the salt and the mom's liked the flavor as much as their kids. Buy these for your next party and you will be everyone's hero

This is some amazing sweet corn. It's dried but also very light and airy, and it really does taste like sweet corn and is a great snack. Why only 4 stars? One is that they put salt on it for some reason, which really detracts from the overall taste - if they'd leave out the salt and maybe tell to that you can add some to taste (and neither of us would add any, it doesn't need it), they'd have a real winner. The second is that you have to buy a case quantity, and while it's a very tasty snack, it's going to take a long time, and waste a lot of cabinet space, to get through 24 packs of it - especialy with the salt content.

It is a shame someone ruined the star rating on this product with a shipping complaint.  We have bought the Supper Nutty and Crisp n' Crunchy Golden temple granola flavors also.  All are great, but this one is by far the best.  My husband absolutely loves it, he can't get enough.  It is like a traditional granola, with a good crunch, but it isn't too sweet, which is nice.  It is also one of the few brands without processed sugars.  I will be ordering this one again.

Note, the ingredients listed on Amazon are incorrect.  The first ingredient is organic rolled oats, not organic rolled wheat.  At least when we purchased a month ago, this is a wheat-free, soy-free, vegan cereal (aside from potential cross-contamination).  Unless it changed within the month since our purchase for some strange reason

For anyone who needs a shelf-stable, quick lunch option, this is the one!  The soup is delicious and the prep couldn't be easier, plus I love that you can prepare and eat it right in the bowl.  I always make sure I have a few of these in my desk drawer at work, so I never have an "I forgot my lunch" issue, and the portion is big enough to actually constitute a full meal (for lunch anyway).  I love the Udon flavor, and my husband swears by the Miso

I've had miso soups at various restaurants and this is actually really good.  I love the fact they are environmentally concerned with their products.  I'll buy their products just knowing they care so much about how much we have to throw away, so it's biodegradable.  Only thing I'm not crazy about is the noodles, I would have preferred a thinner noodle, only because it's so bulky, and not really typical of Asian dish

Authenic but a little bland for me. I add Ponzu sauce to taste and make sure it gets really HOT in the micriwave. If steaming when you take it out, it tastes better. Pre Rinsing the noodles (as directed) is nonsense. Just cover them with good clean water (I never use TAP) stir in the sauce and toppings and nuke it about 90 seconds, uncovered. Stir and serve. It had everyone in MY OFFICE drooling with questions! Best price is on Amazon, just order 2 so you don't pay shipping.

I've tried several of the Annie Chun flavors, and I liked most of them, but the Kimchi soup is just unbelievably delicious! This is the BEST packaged soup product of any kind that I have ever tried, and I usually dislike canned or packaged soup products.  This is even better than my favorite canned Brunswick Stew that I have loved for so long!  

It is moderately spicy, but if you don't mind a bit if spice, this one is just too good to pass up.  I could practically live off of this stuff!

Thank you, Annie Chun, for making a packaged meal worth eating

Finally there is a quick way to make a great Udon Soup at home!  For any Udon fan, this is a must try product.  The noodles are as good as Udon noodles get, and the soup mix is great base to start your Udon.  Here is the way we make Udon using this product as a base:

We take the noodles and soup mix from two packages (bowls), add some additional soy sauce and spices we like, and boil it all in a pan (you don't need to screw around with all the noodle rinsing, just throw them in the pot).  When the soup and noodles are warm, we add chopped romaine.  This is super good, and costs less than $[...] for two LARGE servings of Udon - a deal by any standard!!

When we really want a full-on Udon, we add some sliced pressed fish like the restaurants use in traditional Udon (the half moon pressed fish, white with the orange/red coating) and shrimp.  This is heavenly!!

I added a half of dozen or so of frozen pre-cooked shrimp and this was great as an evening meal.  The package includes the spices that one would expect to find in a Tom Yum Thai soup.  While the quality may not be what one might expect to find in a good Thai restaurant, preparation in five minutes is surely an acceptable compromise

When I first opened my 6-pack of crackers, the organic nature really seemed to hit me hard at first.  But a few crackers later, and they were hard to put down.  It is one of the healthiest crackers I've had, not salty, but the currants provide that tinge of sweetness that really makes it an interesting cracker to eat...and continue eating.  Highly recommended...especially if you sit at a desk all day at work like me and want a healthy snack food

The Dr. Kracker Snacker, Spelt Muesli Stick provide the same great taste and crunch as their other products, but with a hint of sweetness due to the bits of dried fruit in the cracker. Their smaller sizes makes them suitable for a quick snack and they are very filling. The amount of carbohydrates in each is very small in comparison to other snack crackers

I disagree with the person who gave this product only one star.  I did find that I had to beat the cake longer than the box indicated and needed to bake it longer.  I mixed my first one using my portable hand mixer which was really too small for this product.  Second time I used my new stand mixer with the whip attachment.  It more than doubled in volume after beating it about 10 minutes longer than the package suggested and I beat it on high.  The cake filled my tube pan to the top and I baked it about 5 minutes longer than package suggested as my first one was a bit underbaked.  My husband, who is NOT celiac, loves this cake also. We can't tell the difference between this one and a regular angel food cake mix.  I also used 1 teaspoon of GF vanilla and 1 teaspoon of GF almond extract instead of using 2 of vanilla.  I like the almond flavoring in angel food cake better, but that is personal preference.

Tastes pretty good, but it's still not Starbucks.  I like ordering this with free shipping and the GROCERY coupon codes Amazon runs occasionally.  Last time I got $10 off 2 cases.  Then its worth the price.  Their chocolate espresso beans are great

These are pefect for a quick pick me up in the morning. I don't like hot drinks, but I need something with the power of coffee to get me going after I wake up. These drinks taste just as good as their Starbucks equivalent, but are much less expensive.

I wouldn't consider myself a jerky expert. But I do like jerky, and I have tried more than a handful of brands.

This is definitely better than most. You can taste the brown sugar, and the spicy. Actually you can see the spicy all over the insides of the bag. Don't rub your eye after eating this stuff.

Most of the strips were soft and chewy. And not overly salty like others I've tasted. And I feel the spicy on my tongue as well as the back of my throat, which is always a good sign.

I will be putting in another order in a few weeks, so I can have some at a camping trip.

I'll preface this by stating that I love hot foods and I am not affected by them, so I can understand other reviews saying that the World Kitches Hot and Spicy was too spicy.  This was not the case for me though.  I found it to be a perfect blend of spicy and sweet.  I really enjoyed it and ordered more.  I got on a kick where I thought I would try all of the spicy jerkys on Amazon.   I found this to be the one I liked the most, because of bothe the flavor and the fact that there were a lot of thin cuts of meat, which made it easier to eat.  This does have a kick, so if that is a potential problem you may want to go with something milder.  I will say I have had even hotter, but if you enjoy some flavor with your spice, you may want to give this a try

Yes, this beef jerky is hot. That's why it's "hot & spicy." If you always order your Mexican or Chinese food mild, I'd say to get a different flavor. The spice blend (which is mostly hot pepper) is pretty good. The quality of the beef is as good or better than any of the mass-market beef jerky you can pick up at your local store. The big difference? This stuff is about 1/4 the price. If you like beef jerky, buy this brand. There is no better value out there unless you're making it yourself. I'll probably order some every time I order books

It is "special" to be offered your choice of tea and company always enjoys picking their own flavor. It is especially nice when it is presented in a lovely wooden box ( sort of like opening a gift).You soon learn your friends favorites. It also makes a lovely gift.

I saw this and thought it would be worth trying, primarily to have a nice box to keep tea in.  The box is great, but I was astonished at how much I like the teas.  Whatever their source for tea (100% Ceylon) has a very smooth and distinctive flavor.  Their English Breakfast is easily the best black tea I've tried (and I love tea), at least when taken without milk.  It's fine with milk, but isn't as good as some UK teas.  The flavored teas are all very well balanced as well.  I'd strongly recommend this (or a related smaller size) if you're looking for some very great tea as well as a good place to keep it

I have regular and quite extravagant High Teas. This set was given to me as a gift.  I tried it the first time on a table full of guests...and die-hard tea party ladies.

None of us knew what to expect - it was wonderful - to say the least - lots of oohs and ahhs!  The tea (can't remember which was used first) was delicate and tasty.  It was enjoyed by everyone.

Unfortunately, the second time I made tea - it was fairly bitter - but the presentation was still spectacular....and being a good hostess - I had the "back-up" teapot of regular tea on the table.  Nobody complained as everyone enjoyed the show.  I will purchase more tea.

The clear glass teapot is adorable.  The bamboo box is of average construction, and it might not take too hard a beating if you decide to put it to some other use, but it looks attractive on the counter.  The flowering teas won't change your life, but they taste nice and are interesting to watch.  My husband and I had great fun watching them unfurl and taking pictures

The packaging was great, came sealed inside a cardboard box which can easily be gift-wrapped. Although I was planning to give this one as a gift, I felt the need to open it and take a look.  Shouldn't have done that because I soon knew it had to be mine.  With my first dinner guests after delivery, I boiled water, opened the bamboo box, removed the glass pot, selected the flowering tea from the top of the pile, and brought it to the table after pouring the water onto the tea.  Oh my Godness, what a sight!  I didn't say a word and it was hysterical to see the look of the first person who noticed the flower bloom!  We agreed that it looked like a monster at first, and after laughing amongst ourselves, I poured the first pot of tea into three small teacups.  Yummy.  Poured a second pot, then a third.  Each was great and each time the visual was so lovely.  We came to the computer and ordered three more sets.  I know I'll be ordering more, too, with extra boxes of the flowering teas.  Every part of this set was wonderful, from the packaging and delivery, bamboo boxes, little glass teapot, and tasty teas.  It's a real nice value and very presentable gift. Amazon's prices can't be beat on these

The tea is great tasting.  If that were not enough, the empty tins are attractive little storage containers to have on hand.

Twinings is apparently the original Earl Grey tea, and it shows why it became so popular. Even with so many imitators, none can compare to the perfect cup created from Twinings loose leaf. Even the bagged variety is better than most other offerings.

Do yourself a favor and skip out on fancy boutique varieties that never rise above sub-par, and stock up on the best. And forget about other mass-market brands such as Taylors or Bigelow, they aren't even in the same ballpark

Earl Grey is my favorite blend of tea by far - no competition there. The biggest secret with this tea once given to Earl Grey of Hoswick Hall (British Prime Minister in 1830 - 1834) by a Chinese manadarin, reportedly in gratitude after the earl saved his life, is to get just the right doseage of bergamot oil, a rather intense, tangy scent derived from the bergamot orange (which in turn is a cross between the pear lemon and the sour orange; the latter is native to South Vietnam, and its oil was probably the recipe's original ingredient). Using too much bergamot oil can easily obscure the black tea's natural flavor - but with Twinings you just can't go wrong, because the original Earl Grey turned to this very company for a match to the quickly dwindling supply he had received from his Chinese friend.

(From the Twinings website: "When the mandarin's tasty gift began to run out, Earl Grey asked his tea merchants, Twinings, to match it for him. Twinings unique blend was the Grey family's long-standing favourite. When guests inquired about it, they were directed to Twinings on the Strand, where they would ask for Earl Grey's tea by name.")

Unless you insist on having *all* your tea with cream or milk, I recommend having this one without any kind of milk products: not only does the original recipe not call for such an addition; in my mind it just plain ruins the blend's particular flavor. (But that's just me, of course.) Whichever way you have it, though, if scented teas are your kind of thing, Twinings Earl Grey should be right up your alley

I love Orville Redenbacher popcorn and decided to try out this new corn on the cobb flavor. Its flavor is good but very light and doesn't taste like corn on the cobb to me. I usually buy the Ultimate Butter flavor which is much more flavorful and buttery than this one. 

I will probably not buy this flavor again, and will stick to the Ultimate Butter flavor.

 I bought these Because Dr. Manny (FOX NEWS FAN!!) said they were better for you than the other leading bars on the market. Boy was he RIGHT these are Good!! the "filling" reminds me of a nut filled danish just not as sweet but just as satisfying... My husband looked at me funny but he tasted them and takes them to his training as a prework out boost as well as an after dinner snack as I don't but treats but these work for us !!

I bought these because I have a corn allergy and wanted to substitute them for the LA Weightloss bars that list corn syrup as the first ingredient.  I was pleasantly surprised that they were pretty tasty! My favorites are actually the Fudgie Filberts that taste similar to a Little Debbie brownie if Little Debbie's were diet. Following that I would say Almond and Coconut are tied for second. Third is the Peanut Butter which is the highest in protein but not as good as the others. My husband didn't like any of them but could tolerate the one I liked least, Peanut Butter.  Over all I think these are great as a healthy snack for people with food allergies or other dietary restrictions. I think I would have picked a different name than Betty Lou's Nut Butter Balls.  Nut Butter Balls doesn't sound as appetizing as what they actually are!! Nut Butter Balls.....Mmmmmm

This is without a doubt my favorite flavor of all of these.  I'm a bit of a novice in the world of veganism, and these are one of my favorite ways to get some protien in my system.  They're soft, yet portable and fill you up for quite awhile even though they look small.  I love these things

If you try this, which i highly reccomend, you will notice that the soda has a very strong fruity flavor. I really thought it had a great taste, also I think that it really calms you down. I dont know if it is one of the fruit extracts in it or if it is an herb, but it works.

I'd never tried this particular trail mix from planters, so I just ordered it based on how good it looked in the picture. And I must say, this is one of the tastiest snacks ever. Everything in there, the peanuts, almonds, raisins, etc... all taste great. The only problem is that I can't stop eating them. :(

But it least they're quite healthy. So it looks like I'll be ordering some more! Highly recommended!

I love these!  They're a great source of fiber without having to drink that powdered goo or eating a bushel of broccoli everyday.  And my kids love them too, yes, they are that delicious!  I put these in their lunches and they think it's a treat.  Amazon is the only way to buy them though, so expensive at the grocery stores.  And don't worry about buying too many, they will not go to waste!  The brown-sugar ones taste good but are a little firm and crunchy, so I recommend the honey-oat,  definitely the best.  Enjoy

These are the only cerial bars easily available that actually have a worthwhile fiber content. Each bar has 5g of Fiber, that is 20% of the recomended daily amount. This is great for IBS sufferers, or those who care about their internal health. They taste good, like HobNob biscuits you can get in the UK

Like all of the other All Bran Cereal Bars, these are excellent. My personal favorite over the other 2 flavors, but all three are divine. Again, wish Amazon would stock up on more of these because they always run out! (It might be because of me.) :)

But again, tasty, low calorie, high in fiber, all around good

This jerky is not just an excellent value, it is by far the best jerky we have eaten. I buy it every year as Christmas gifts (and ofcourse, save one pkg for us) and everyone raves about it. My family always looks forward to Christmas because they know jerky will be there for the holidays. Perfect to put in your day pack for a hike, or to take with you on vacations,camping trips, or even to the office for a quick, healthy snack. Delish!
You can't beat the price, and quality of this jerky. You really get a lot. I would highly recommend this product, and have, to several family members as well as friends. A+++ Thanks! Best secret in the jerky market.

I order several bags of this in the hot and spicy. It had a grit texture like it had sand in it. I wrote the company and found out that some bags were manufactured with larger grain sugar than they had intended. This caused the grit texture. They sent me replacement bags, and the replacements were wonderful. Excellent flavor and texture. 

Give them a second chance

These cookies were a seasonal offering at a local store.  I purchased one box.  After trying them at home, I returned to the store and purchased the remaining inventory! A simple scoop of vanilla ice cream is transformed by the inclusion of a butter crisp. I also love them with tea...or straight out of the box.  Don't be daunted by purchasing a pack of 12 boxes.  The cost is a little over half of what I paid in the store.  Lastly, unless you hide them in a dark corner of your pantry, you'll never have to worry about the shelf life, because they will be consumed quickly by family, friends, and yourself!

This is a very good and hearty product. It's easy to take to work or camping. Nice consistency. It has the diabetic exchange values listed on the package, so it's easy to keep track.

Basically, hot fries are god.  I have to say that the majority of young people love Hot Fries.  Those that do not like Hot Fries will find them inedible.  Some people love hot fries, I happen to be one of them.  It's great having a case of these, always having a bag on hand for that omnipresent hot fry hunger.  I guess there might be some crack thrown in at the factory.  These are definitely worth a try at this price.  If you love hot fries, or even only eat them occasionally, this will save you money, and you'll never have to drive to the 7-11 at 10pm anymore

This has been my favorite snack food for over 30 years.  Since I recently moved, and hot fries are not sold in my local store, I was delighted to see them offered on Amazon.  This is a low calorie snack with no sugar.  And it tastes great!

These are great!  I couldn't stop eating, and I didn't care because they're so healthy!  I'll try to keep it down to one bag a day.

The BBQ flavor is about as authentic as any potato chips I've ever eaten, and these chips are really crunchy too!  Just make sure you have a napkin and perhaps a dustbuster available when you come up for air

I really like these for snacks. Peanut butter is so healthy, but messy to "pack" away for mid-day. The perfect size to be filling, but not too large that you will waste any. Tastes like peanut butter cookie dough (without the work, or the raw eggs!) Enjo

I have tried all the Scarpetta line and this sauce is the cornerstone of their line.  Excellent for all factes of cooking and should be a staple in your kitchen pantry.  Simply simmer the sauce and allow the aroma to fill the house like you have been working on it all day.  No one needs to know the truth

This is hands down the best cereal I have ever tried, and I've tried a lot.  I have eaten cereal almost every day of my life.  You won't find a cereal with more fiber and protein that tastes better than this one.  It has excellent crunch without the Cap'n Crunch effect of shredding your gums.  It has a mild sweetness to it without being too sugary.  Add a little fruit to it and you have the perfect breakfast.  The only problem is that it's hard to find and can cost a little more.  Even Amazon has run out.  Make more please

When I first tried this cereal, I expected it to be like most "organic" type cereals; dry, ugly texture, awful taste. But I was pleasantly surprised and have been eating it ever since. The taste and texture are great and it would be difficult to find another cereal that delivers all the vitamins, minerals protein, fiber, calcium, low calories, etc. that still manages to taste great. Also, it has the blessing of the American Heart Association. You just can't go wrong with this product and I will continue to enjoy it

A friend told me about Optimum Slim.  She ate it for its high protein content.  I bought a box and was immediately impressed by the number of nutrients, high protein, AND high fiber -- everything I look for in a breakfast to start my day.  And I love the texture and taste.  My 17 year-old son (who, like 'Mikey', hates everything)tried it and, guess what?  He likes it! (Hey, Mikey. . . . )
We are thankful that our friends at Amazon.com are selling this considerably cheaper then we can get it at our local supermarket, as we go through a box every other day.

I love that these cookies can be dunked in milk and not fall apart!  they reallly are that good.  also, it seems as if they put a raw sugar on the outside b/c you can taste the sugar but yet they are not loaded w/sugar.  (haven't tried other flavors yet

The best sandwich cookie you've ever tasted! No trans fat, no refined sugars, no hydrogenated oils, no cholesterol, nothing artificial, and just the right blend of mint and chocolate! It just goes to show you, a company can produce something tasty AND healthy! You won't be disppointed if you try these...

I have eaten a fair quantity of these over the last few months, and they are not bad at all! If you are looking for a sweet sugar-free snack, then they fit the bill.  I have experienced no digestive issues with these at all, unlike some other sugar-free sweets

Blue Weber agave is the lowest glycemic index of agave nectar.  This is 100% blue weber, a great flavor, and price.  I use it in tea, and baking, or just about any where I would use a bit of sugar.   The texture and flavor is like honey.  Great stuff

This tastes great, I love it in my coffee, and have even used it for pancakes.  It really doesn't give me a spike in blood sugar, as promised.  The only negative is the packaging they are using.  During shipping, some of the seals underneath the lids came off, and the bottles leaked.  I probably lost about a tablespoon (each) from 3 of the 6 bottles.  The lids don't really fit the bottles, either.  They have a pop-top, but if you use it, the syrup sometimes leakes out from under the lid where it attaches to the bottle.  If they could fix the bottles, this would definitely be a five-star product.

I was tired of buying so many boxes of cereal a week.  My teenage son eats it like its going out of style.  And there are bowls and spoons all over the house. I tried this to try and get a variety.  They actually lasted about a month and it was nice to not have bowls to wash.  Now if only the spoon were included!  Also, it would be nice to have even more variety, but all in all, great purchase

I enjoyed eating cerial. Whether if it is for before school, work, or just to snack on. And what I like about this is that they come in varieties (Frosted Flakes, Froot Loops, Cocoa Puffs, etc.), so I won't be eating the same thing every time, which is also good. If you're in a rush in the morning and want something to grab and go within a 15 minute period, I recommend this to you. Also you don't have to waiste your dishes, because they come in their own plastic bowls.

My only problem is that they are so small, and after about 10 spoon fulls, it's all gone. Sometimes I'm still hungry after eating one packet (and I'm skinny too).

True this contains Trans Fats, what breakfast item that kids enjoy eating doesn't contain them? Not very many items. Maybe eggs, and whatnot. Also if your kids are somewhat active in somekind of fitness activities, those "deadly trans fats" should be worked off by the end of the day. And using fat free milk with the cerial would make the situation better also

*****
Numi Tea's Chinese Breakfast Yunnan Black Tea is a premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher. The only ingredient is fair trade certified organic high mountain Yunnan Black Tea FOP (Flowery Orange Pekoe). There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.

On the box, the manufacturer writes: "This noble tea is grown in the mist covered mountains of Yunnan province. What distinguishes this fine, organic black tea is its perfect sense of balance, exquisite tiger's eye color, and a lean vibrancy which makes it suitable at any time of day. Like a complex wine, it is the perfect tea for food, marrying well with a wide variety of dishes. It has a distant and hard to place floral quality, yet it leaves the mouth tasting as clean as spring water. And it energizes the body and mind more harmoniously than the best of coffees. We are proud to bring you this high grade leaf." 

Although this tea says "orange pekoe", it does not taste citrus-y, but has a strong morning black tea taste with flowery overtones.  It is like a regular orange pekoe upgraded many, many times, with something delicate, lovely, and flowery added.  It's the perfect morning tea, or for anytime you want a high-quality pick-me-up.

The price is super, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love regular black, this will probably be the best you've ever had, and you'll wonder why you ever drank the "old stuff"!

I use this espresso as regular coffee for a drip machine. It is loaded with flavor, full rich flavors, and no bitterness. I have purchased it twice, first the five pound bag, then 4 one-pound bags. I think the individual bags are not only a better value but they can stay very fresh until you need them. I had no trouble with the 5 pound though, it was a delicious on the first day as the last. I highly recommend this coffee

Seeing as to how I'm a chocaholic, I thoroughly enjoy getting my morning fix with my cereal.  As a kid I'd break Hershey's Chocolate into chunks and drop them in my Frosted Flakes....had I only thought then to patent that idea as Kellogg's has done I'd be rakin' in all the dough....  :D

I thought this was actually pretty good. The chocolate pieces added just enough chocolate taste to enjoy. I did not have any issues with 'waxy' taste. This is not baking choclate that melts in your hand so don't expect it to be. It has to hold up in the milk as well as on the shelf. I will definitely purchase again.

Purchased it (and a Keurig coffee machine) for my husbands Grandmother - she can use the coffee machine without the threat of spilling from a coffee pot.  She is sooo happy!!!  This is the flavor she liked best from a variety pack, and I was able to buy this from home and ship it to her in Wisconsin. Perfect for an older person who may not be as steady, and I can keep her in coffee for months with Amazon and their 2-pack of K-cups at such a great price and free shipping.  Thank you for helping me help Grandma

My family tends to eat in "shifts", and we eat a lot of rice. If I cook a pot of rice, it takes 30 minutes, and is cold and sticky by the time my family gets to it. Now, my boys can have their rice when they want it. Viva La Rice works great for lunch, too. We really like this product

At roughly 3.5 a brewing, this is a great deal

This is an awfully nice gift pack if you want to take the oils out of the box. The cardboard box with the story of the oils/manufacturer came with a big florescent pink label screaming" NOT INTENDED FOR INDIVIDUAL SALE: Sell only on Amazon" or something of the sort directly over the text explaining the oils. I was disappointed as people like to read about where gourmet gifts come from and I had planned on wrapping them in the box. Other than that, the tins cans are very attractive and unique. My parents were VERY happy with them.

I enjoyed McCann's sugar free instant oatmeal. The texture is much better than some other instant oatmeals that remind me of pulverized cardboard.  The maple brown sugar flavor has a deep maple flavor.  The sweetness tastes natural, not artificial.  I love that each packet only contains 100 calories, yet is very satisfying

Baxters soups are usually very nice, but the lobster bisque is especially good. It tastes authentic, it has a good flavour, is creamy, and has just enough lobster bits to make it interesting. Add some fresh black pepper and a dash of brandy or sherry and it rivals soup served in a very good restaurant.

It's also surprisingly low calorie. Though the nutrition info here says 130 calories for 8oz, the label actually says 120 calories, so even if you ate the whole can for lunch you would consume only about 220 calories

I too purchased these on a Friday sale, six bags for $6.99.  Considering the current price, Amazon must have either mispriced them or been out of their minds.  If they ever go back on for that price, don't hesitate.  They are completely fresh and perfect for cooking or just eating right out of the bag.  Oh, I forgot to mention; they are terrific on top of a banana split

These slivered almonds are an excellent addition to salads.  

I'm sure they are good for lots of other things (baking, stir fry), but they definitely make plain salads seem a lot more gourmet.  And they're the perfect size/shape/cut for this purpose.

The shelf life is also great.  Especially if you store them in the freezer or fridge you should be good for more than 6 months.   A bit pricey retail, but you can't beat the Amazon 6-pack discounted price.  I'm stocking up

I've been using Colman's mustard ever since I spent a month in Ireland and the UK on business. The food was basically inedible, even the steaks, until I started slathering on the Colman's. Makes all the difference - the mustard has a horseradish type kick thats addicting. I've stopped asking for Colman's at US restaurants - they think I'm weird, but I definitely keep a supply at home. Its great on all meats and poultry, even vegetables. There's not many foods I won't put it on.  Thank you Britain for this major contribution to the culinary arts

I bought a multipack of all the Nutrisodas from beveragesdirect, and i thought for the longest time that all the nutrisodas had energy stuff in it. in fact, only the "energy" nutrisoda was "energetic".

I can't say much about how good this was for my joints, but this is my favorite flavor out of the bunch (and i've had the chance to sample all the nutrisoda flavors). it's like a sparkling apple drink with a midtone of cherry. and anyone can make good use of the ingredients they added for joints in this stress-filled world

Unlike the other reviewers, I do not like fruit rollups or leathery fruit bars of any kind.  These bars are soft and chewy and very satisfying.  They are a great snack to keep handy.  I would highly recommend, especially if you are a person who doesn't usually like the other types of fruit leathers, sticks, rollups, etc

Wow, we've never had so much Macaroni and Cheese in a long time! And Annie's is really, really good. This doesn't need additional milk or butter, and the sauce is an easy-to-squeeze out paste in a foil package. It tastes great, and makes a great receptacle for some creativity of your own too.

Tips to enjoy it:

- Just boil in plenty of water, the six-cup requirement is a minimum.

- Drain quickly, put the pasta back in the hot pot. The remaining heat is just right to melt the thick cheesy sauce into the macaroni. Don't rinse the pasta in cold water, it will make it hard for the sauce to combine well.

- All the Deluxe versions are animal rennet free. Annie's FAQ is very specific about which ones use vegetable rennet (not all do) but Amazon isn't picking up the information. I tag the really vegetarian ones "animal rennet-free" whenever I can.

- Try blending sundried tomatoes, a fresh tomato, olive oil, garlic, pizza peppers, salt, freshly ground pepper, and a touch of balsamic vinegar into a paste. This really complements the mac and cheese and gives it a new, gourmet taste that still doesn't take away from the "mac and cheesiness" of it.

- Tabasco Chipotle sauce makes a great addition for the adventurous. The smoky taste is tempered by the creaminess

I just got a case of these - my 2 year old and I had just introduced ourselves to 'fruit leathers', which we love.  I figured I'd look this up as it's considerably less expensive per bar than buying an 8-pack at the store.

My daughter absolutely loves these and so do I!  We're planning on bringing them as treats when we go across the street and play with the kids who stay with one of my neighbors.  My daughter even told me that they're now her favorite treat.  And I feel fine knowing she's getting something that's really tasty and sweet but that it's not gonna kill her with too much sugar and corn syrup

These are the perfect snack for on the go.  Actual REAL fruit--No sugar!  No "roll-ups" with 10% fruit!  They are not dry or leathery and even little kids can chew them well.  Just the right size for toddlers and small kids (and Moms too).  Great to stick in the diaper bag or purse for an impromptu healthy snack.  Works in any weather (won't melt) and even survives at the bottom of the purse!  Comes in lots of flavors, an organic version, and bigger bars too for a bigger snack.  Cheaper than lesser products at the grocery store.  GREAT!

Great flavor, easy to dispense, and a nice metal canister!  I'm not a big connoisseur of teas, but the fact that it was green tea helped me decide to try it.  And, for the nice price, I'm glad I did.  Will be nice to give a canister away here and there to friends and family.

I LOVE this product. It is reasonably priced when one considers each packet can be reconstituted to equal one cup of broth. The broth is organic with a rich flavor of chicken( I also use the beef broth & it is delicious as well) but my favorite feature is one may store the equivalent of 6 cans of broth in less space than one can takes up. A definite 5 stars from me. "Savory Choice" broth concentrates are the best!!!!

Great product when you need just a little extra stock/broth.  It won't replace my use of Swanson's because it would be too much to open 8 packages for 2 quarts of stock for soup etc. but it is great for making pilaf etc. or when you're just a little short of the quantity needed

These are very tasty indeed.  The flavors taste natural and fresh, better than I expected, and the texture is very good.  My young son has a real sweet tooth and these are a great treat for him. In fact my whole family enjoys them.  My husband about died when he saw I ordered a case of "Pop Tarts", but he was pleasantly surprised by the taste and the more healthful ingredients.  I will definitely keep these on my shopping list, and recommend them to anyone, especially families with children who want a quick and tasty snack that's a little more "fun" than a piece of toast and more wholesome than a donut or (most) cookies.

Yes, these Toaster Pastries from Nature's Path are the only thing my 3-year-old will eat for her breakfast.  Thanksfully, they are fairly healthy.  Now her 2 older brothers are making it a staple for their breakfast also.  They are very tasty and toast well in the toaster.  The frosted strawberry and blueberry ones are equally as good - just depends on your taste preference.  We have not tried any of the UNfrosted ones though

Bran Buds is definitely one of the better bran cereals around.  It actually tastes good.  (OK, it isn't a cinnamon roll, but it's still pretty good.)  It stays crunchy in milk, but is not so hard that you wonder if your teeth will be damaged.  I like combining bran buds and a flake cereal.  Bran Buds has been at my breakfast table for years.

Good cereal if you like something other than flakes. It doesn't get mushy like them. However, this product doesn't provide the minimum vitamin content some other breakfast cereals do, an important consideration when one considers how vitamin deprived many of us are (and carbohydrate stuffed).

I like the way this tastes, but it's not fantastic. it fills you up (fiber expands) and keeps you regular. Honestly 2/3 a cup and your set for breakfast. i don't know what's wrong with the last guy who posted. I'm pretty sure he's some dude who thought it would be funny to write a post about some old guy's unfortunate run in with bran. Nothing goes through you that fast. Bran is not a laxative. Its bulk forming fiber. I wouldn't really care except that this is a good product

I took a chance buying 6 boxes of this cereal, and I was rewarded!  It is flavorful, crispy, and reasonably proced.  The only problem is that one of my six boxes had a hole in the bag.  I discovered tis because  the cereal leaked our through the cracks in the box.  Still a decent value with the lost box

My local Whole Foods sells Nature's Path products for $3.79 a box, so this Amazon.com price is an excellent deal. 

The cereal is hearty and crunchy, although it becomes soft in a few short minutes when submerged in milk. I sometimes add a little sweetner, as sugar is not added artificially. My housemate (who grew up in France & Italy), loves this cereal, as he says it reminds him of his European 'grainy' musli-style cereals. However, I am not a big fan of what is sold as 'Musli' or 'Muslix' in this country and Heritage Bites are nothing like this.

Think Chex style bites and crunch, without the Chex fake crunch, slimy coating, preservatives and sugars.

Upon arrival, I read the nutrition info myself on the cereal box and was pleasantly surprised to find they were better than Amazon's listing. They have 6 grams of fiber (balanced soluble and insoluble fiber) in a 1 ounce (28 gram=3/4 cup) serving and only 5 grams of sugars, all for only 100 calories. All this isn't worth much though, if they don't taste good, right? Well, they are good, very yummy, even out of the box. They are rather like "Life" cereal, regular flavor, just a bit less stripped of the good stuff in taste. The whole grains really shine through and they tend to stay crispy in milk much longer. I enjoyed a bowl of them topped with just a fine bit of honey so that the flax seeds I topped them with would stick and not sink to the bottom, a bowl plain with milk, and also a bowl made into a "Muddy Buddies" healthy version. I bought these initially to make the recipe "Muddy Buddies/Puppy Chow" recipe healthier (using alternatively sweetened chocolate, freshly ground almond or peanut butters and some date sugar to toss in after coating. These would also be a great alternative choice for other "Chex" cereal recipes. I like them so much, I will give up my usual choices in cereal that provide the same, or less, amount of fiber for TWICE the calories and that also soak up too much milk in the bowl. Give these a try, they won't replace some of the worst offending sugar laden "kid's" cereals with no one noticing, but these are really a good choice and tasty, and are always handy for those "chex mix" recipes with a healthier spin. If a sugar addict really needs more sweetening, just let them top these with a better choice in sweetener of your own choice, not a giant company's choice in what makes them the most profit. Best of all, we can have something affordable we like the taste of without supporting these huge companies that are ruining our health and economy , as well as putting the family farmers out of business. I can't think of any reasons why I wouldn't recommend these.

I love these Crystal Light on The Go packets. I have to travel about 20-40 miles to do my shopping, so I like to have a beverage with me on my trip home. These really come in handy when a store has nothing cold that I like. I hate water. It has no taste. These packets come in when a store has no good soda. The only problem with these packets is that sometimes the powder doesn't dissolve completely in the bottld water you use. A lot of times, a big clump of powder mix forms at the bottom of the bottle and you have to find a way to stir it to make it dissolv

They are crisp, buttery yet light. 

Unlike some other cookies, they even taste great when they are broken into smaller pieces (as shipping by Belgium is liable to do sometimes).

The only downside is they are addicting - there are about 24 wafers per box and before you know, it's time to order another 12-pack :-)

Yes, it seems like a lot but if you need to remove temptation - these make great gifts. As you can see, the boxes are classy and in most gourmet stores, EACH box can sell for nearly $6! ... so you will also seem a genuine benefactor :-)

The only thing wrong with these cookies is that Amazon makes it too easy to obtain :-

The Crown Prince brand has been one of my favorites. I like their oysters not just for the price (at the local grocery store) but as well as for the flavor.  Though here at Amazon, buying a pack of 24 oysters at once might be a bit extreme...

These are very, very good. I love these for a snack and they take care of a sweet craving too. Not too awful sugary sweet, just sweet and tart enough! I tried a handful in my oatmeal with some vanilla creamer this mornining for a treat and it was so good with those sweet, tart cherries. They are great to snack on and add to muffins and in baking. A great buy in bulk, compared to what I find in our local supermarkets which are very pricey! These are nice sized and fresh too! They would be great in trail mix. My husband likes them as a snack in his lunch too! Thumbs up!!

Wow.  Just in time for the holidays!  Now I can brine or bbq my turkey, methods that leave me with little or no usable pan juices, and still make a great gravy.  And a turkey base instead of chicken for my leftover soup too!  What a concept!
This is a super simple product to use.  Little storage space and little waste but big on flavor.   
I keep some of each flavor in my RV.  It would be great for any camping style, especially backpacking

It is great with a little splenda or to really bring it up a notch I will lightly thaw 1 C of frozen berries and add that with a little splenda. YUM!!

I agree with everything that the previous reviewer wrote in their review.  I gave the cookies a rating of 5 stars though because i havent eaten a cookie in about 4 years without getting sick.  This is because I have severe allergies to wheat and soy.  Pretty much every cookie you will find in a normal grocery store will have one if not both of these ingrediants.  So when I found Nana's cookies I was as happy as can be.  Yes the texture is different than a wheat cookie but it's better than going without cookies.  It also doesnt hurt that these cookies are delicious.  If you are like me and have a very limited diet these cookies are  a very welcome addition to that diet.

Frankly, I think the chicken flavor is a bit bland. The noodle texture is good and rather filling. Probably the traditional ramen flavor taste better. 

But with the price offered and the free shipping, it is a great buy and fantastic delivery service

These bars are fairly good to be "healthy," yet they lack the flavor and texture of many other granola or fruit breakfast bars.  To me they taste like the equivalent of whole grain rice crispy treats (if there were such things) with added cranberries and some ginger.  The combination of the cranberries and ginger do aid in the flavor, but the bars are "stickier" than I had expected.  All things considered, though, they seem to be a healthy alternative to more caloric bars

This is the best Peanut Butter product ever produced by major American food service company.

If you're expecting "peanuts and salt" with separated oil and a rock-hard refrigerated consistency after opening, this is not that product. If, however, you dislike most of those products -- which are more annoying to eat than many people find to be worthwhile -- this is what you've been waiting for.

It uses a natural tropical oil, which has a naturally long shelf-life, as opposed to the disastrously unhealthy "alternative" of hydrogenated oils.

Many people panic over seeing "saturated", but that is exactly the sort of grossly uninformative evaluation that led us to using the (far more deadly) hydrogenated oils to begin with -- advice which is frankly unforgivable. Learn about fats for yourself, and make the right decisions. I recommend "Know your fats", available right here on Amazon.

If you want the most healthy peanut butter you can get, grind your own and eat it fresh, and congratulate yourself for fantastic self-discipline and patience. For the rest of us, we need more products like this. Finally, a "grown-up" version of an  American food product

We love to have peanut butter on toast for breakfast - but my husband would not eat anything but Skippy, no matter how I pleaded.  He does not like natural peanut butter at all.  When I found this in the store I was so happy - and he loves it!  I do too, it tastes great, like Skippy but without all the crap of the original.  Highly recommended

Cranberry center isnt dyed but looks like real berries, which is appreciated. .. these days everything is crayola-colored... I like these even better than the apple ones (which seem to be sweeter). Blueberry and apple are both also good though.  Great to tuck into your purse, because they are sturdy enough they wont crumble into nothing when you cart them around

The Glutino brand excells in taste with no strange aftertaste. This bar was very good although I hoped for less filling and more crust as the filling was too sweet for my taste. I was looking for a bar that wasn't too sweet so the cranberry flavor sounded promising. While it is not as sweet as other flavors, it is still rather sweet.  Still highly recommend this flavor and this brand

Twinings developed this tea last year (2006) for their 300th anniversary - a counterpart to their famous "Earl Grey" product.  "Lady Grey" has the distinctive Earl Grey flavor but with just a hint of floral.  It has become my family's favorite tea.  We can no longer get it in our stores but is easily available on-line from Twinings.  Buy it - maybe we'll get it back in our stores!  A wonderful product!

The first thing you notice when you open a tin of Twinings Lady Grey 
(beside the redolence of bergamot oil mixed with the aroma of black tea and lemon which is a staple of the *Earl* Grey Teas) is the striking visual pattern of the loose tea:
Dark dry tea leaves sprinkled with bright dots of dry orange peel and stunningly-blue cornflower petals.  It is almost as pleasing to the eye as it is to the taste buds. Milder and less caffeinated than the Earl, this mix has become a permanent inhabitant of our pantry and our tea cups for almost 5 years now.

Note that unlike Earl Grey, *Lady Grey* seems to be a Trademark of the Twinings Co.  If you are looking for a similar tea that is not manufactured by Twinings, you may have a hard time figuring what is the exact equivalent.  For example, some other companies market a blend called "Pouchkine" or "Afternoon Earl Grey" which essentially are milder versions of the traditional Earl Grey and lack some proprietary Twinings-only ingredients (most notably, the cornflowers)

It has a strong flavor and its a little different but if you want something to relax you for the evening and put you over the edge...this is it.  I have sent it to friends and family and can tell you most were impressed.  I gave some to my 21 year old daughter who.... has issues and she said it lulled her to sleep so much so she recommended it to a friend

I have trouble finding this particular tea in non-health-food stores. This tea is caffeine-free, so it's ideal for unwinding at the end of the day or for a quiet escape during a stressful work day. The tea has a strong aroma and flavor, a little bit spicy so not for everyone, but I find the scent irresistable and calming on its own. The flavor is a touch of sweet, a touch of tingle on the tongue. And as a bonus, each tea bag label has an inspirational saying on it. Even if you find the quotations silly, they're at least good for a giggle

I've been eating this cereal for years. Aside from being nutritious it is also delicious. It's hard to believe that something that tastes so good could actually be good for you. Usually it's the other way around, if it's good for you it tastes like crap. This sure bucks that system :). It's great with milk for breakfast as usual, and instead of eating something unhealthy for a snack, have a bowl of this cereal.  If you eat it strait out of the box be careful and pay attention, you could eat the whole box and not realize it until you stick your hand in and it's empty, uh oh!  It's really yummy! So go ahead, enjoy it. Oh yea, Amazon has the best price too.

We jokingly call this cereal "bugs, twigs, and leaves" in our house.  However, we do so with affection.  The only complaint we have is that this cereal is a bit on the sweet side.  Okay, it's very sweet!  We find that is its only fault, though.  Having been born and raised on cold cereal, I can honestly say that this is the best I've ever had.  Hubby concurs and eats it for breakfast and dessert.  LOL!  We used to get it at Sam's Club, but it was discontinued quite a while back.  So very happy to find it here at Amazon

First I want to mention that I never write reviews online. I probably should, but I just never have the motivation to do so.

Well, this cereal is so awesome, I just have to review it! I'll shortly explain on a few topics to help you understand its greatness.

Taste: It tastes wonderful! My thoughts during the very first 2 seconds of my very first bite was "Oh man, not another cardboard-tasting cereal." It was just then that the lightly sugary-cinnimony taste hit my tongue. How delightful!

Texture: Its crunchy, just like I like it, but not too crunchy. Its not just flakes like alot of cereals, it contains 4-5 different types of crunchiness!

Effect: This is where the cereal sold me. Taste and texture are wonderful, yes, yet the way it makes me feel is out of this world! I'll pour a bowl of this stuff with my favorite soy silk enhanced milk, scarf it down in hungry and sluggishness... and about 30 min - 1 hour later I'm pumped! Yes, this cereal will literally infuse you with bursting energy. And not just a burst like caffeine... no, this energy lasts for hours! I've had the energy from this last for at least 5 hours each time.

Overall: Even if the price is a tad pricey over the "regular" brands of cereal out there, I love the taste, texture, and effects so much that I dont mind the price! And now that Amazon is selling it cheaper in bulk, the price drops from about 4usd a box to about 3usd a box. 25% off, yes!

Bookmark this page and go try this at your local grocery store first, I'm sure you'll be back to this site to buy in bulk too

I bought the flour to make cookies for my granddaughter for the holidays. It's been a long time since she had homemade cookies, as I had a hard time finding a wheatfree flour that didn't need other ingredients added to it to make it work like all purpose flour. I could not tell the difference between the cookies I made with Organ flour and the ones made with all purpose flour. I look forward to making other recipes for her using this flour.

I bought this product after seeing it on Amazon.  I have tried it in two recipes.  It substitutes just like flour.  I made the best banana nut bread with it!  It is awesome to be able to use a regular recipe without any special instructions and come up with something so good to eat but gluten free.  No need to feel deprived!  I am anxious to try it in some other recipes

*****
This Organic Ginger Tea from Yogi Tea is ideal as a digestive aid, and it also purportedly enhances circulation. It's a lovely, intense, all natural herbal tea made from organic ginger root, organic lemon grass, orgnaic licorice root, organic peppermint leaf, and organic black pepper. The taste is exactly like ginger, spicy and peppery, with sweet overtones. It's very nice anytime, but especially after a meal. 

Note that this review is for the six pack of Organic Ginger Teas, an amazing savings on Amazon by buying in bulk!

I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Ginger Organic Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.

Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: "Our 100% Organic Ginger tea has something to offer to anyone who wants to get or stay healthy. For millennia, herbalists from all over the world have known of the healing, soothing and energizing qualities of this root, considered the "universal medicine."  Organic Ginger (Zingiber officinale) has been used worldwide as a safe and mild home remedy for a variety of conditions, including motion sickness, occasional upset stomach and intestinal gas, as well as minor menstrual cramps. Ayurvedic practitioners have used Ginger for years as a way of activating the body's fire element (Agni), which burns up Ama (the body's toxins, comprised of both undigested food and naturally occurring toxins). When Ama is decreased, the body gains strength, balance and harmony. As a natural warming energizer, Ginger is also known to support the immune system, promote rapid and complete digestion and increase intestinal tone and peristalsis.  Furthermore, it works as an antioxidant and has been shown to safely and effectively relieve nausea associated with motion. Our 100% Organic Ginger tea tastes delicious and provides the highest quality of a timeless remedy." 

There is a warning on the box that if you have indigestion or heartburn that persists you should see a doctor. There are no other cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.

Highly recommended.

When my mother-in-law purchased "light" rice bread, I expected it to be even worse than the regular rice bread we had been tolerating.  However, I was in for a pleasent surprise!  This bread is much lighter than the very dense rice bread made by EnerG.  It still tastes better toasted, but my 4 year old will eat it straight out of the bag too.  I am enjoying it as well - and so much easier to use than my previously preferred brand, which had to be pulled apart with a knife after storing in the freezer.  I have used to make rice crumbs for meatloaf, as sandwiches, as garlic toast, as regular toast, and am hoping to try french toast soon - the first bread even worth attempting that one with

I've never reviewed a food item before, but this delectable little bar was so heavenly I had to change my mind. At the time, it was a mere snack in between classes; afterwards, it earned a place in my heart, as well as my eternal devotion.

Toffee AND almonds + chocolate... 

*sigh*

What more could one ask for?

I am one hardly to ever leave product reviews, and as much as I buy online, I should work on that. But, after trying the various Kashi products, these bars are by far the best and I feel the need to leave a review! I started off eating the Kashi Honey Almond Flax granola bars, which are very good, but definitley not as sweet as these (not a good OR bad thing, just a comparison). However, you will still get the protein, fiber and omega-3s if that's what you're looking for. If you love chocolate and almonds and are looking for a protein/fiber bar that tastes good and is more on the sweet side, this is definitely one to try!!! Whether you use them as a meal replacement or as a snack, they are absolutley amazing and I will definitely be a repeat customer

I gave these cookies five stars because I'm someone that loves whole foods and the richness that affords. They have no wheat and harmful sugar in them. I think they taste great. I don't need (or want) something with 8 tablespoons of sugar to taste good

I love these cookies!  Talk about getting to eat guilt free.  I gave these cookies four stars because someone used to sugar and processed foods could not appreciate these cookies as much as someone that loves whole foods and the richness that affords.
I can't wait to try some of Nana's other cookies!  If you are used to a whole food diet you will give these cookies five stars!!!

I've loved this cereal for many years.  They are like Cheerios, but stay crunchie in milk.  I used to buy it at Whole Foods, but they quit selling it in these Eco Pacs.  I start every morning with a bowl of this cereal and fruit.  My two dogs also get some of this cereal every morning.  It helps keep us healthy, since it is full of fiber

This cereal is super crunchy but it sure beats soggy soup, which is what most cereals turn into after a couple of minutes in milk.  It also makes a great pick-me-up dry snack when you're craving something crunchy, but don't want all the calories and sodium of most chips/crackers/pretzels.  The flavor is mild, kind of along the lines of cheerios, but better in my opinion (since I go through a 2lb. bag of Heritage O's a week).  Whole grain, organic, low sodium, breaks all stay-crunchy records... what else could you ask for in an O's cereal?
One word of caution though.  This cereal may cause those close by to complain of the crunching noise you emit while eating it

I LOVE the 100 calorie packs!My favorites are the Sunchips,the Teddy Grahams,and now the LD shortbreads!

In my town,it's hard to get any of the popular 100 calorie packs,like the Cheetos,Sunchips,or Hostess carrot cakes because they always sell out.But the Teddy Grahams and Lorna Doone shortbreads never seem to sell here,so I always have plenty.

I try to limit myself to one pouch a day,but somedays I might have 2 because they are so good

and really enjoying it !  We tryed both the raspberry and blueberry and for me it's no comparison - the blueberry rules... I'm struggling with drinking less soda and increasing the tea. After I "cold" brewed a glass added some sweetener a few cubes, I fell in LOVE.  Glad I ordered enough to get a start on spring, summer and grilling !  If you like berry flavored beverages, give the ice Cool Brew Tea, Blueberry a try.

great product; unfortunately shipping took a toll on the biscotti's (majority arrived in crumbs & broken pieces). Have since ordered an additional 8 boxes. The lemon ones were shipped in a second Amazon box which seemed to provide some additional protective, as only a few were broken in some of the boxes. Would recommend seller in the future ship all 12 pack boxes in a second box and add extra cushioning protection. It would allow folks to dunk their biscotti's rather than have to eat direct from the wrapper and get crumbs everywhere

I wish I could give 6 out of 5 stars !  With so many choices, I gave two leaves and a bud - a try.  Judging by the package outside, it's like a regular brown box, no fancy tin.  But, the tea is individually wrapped in some soft satin materials and you can see the little tea leaves.  Then, each is wrapped in a plastic to maintain freshness !!  I was blown away by the packaging already at this point.  Then the tasting began, it's such a smooth, delicate tea - I can't describe how nice it is but I quit the cheap lipton or any other brand.  This is the tea for me

This fruit is great for a quickie cobbler.  Just pour a can in a 9"by9" pan. Add cobbler topping (mix together, cup sugar, cup flour, 2tps baking powder, and 1 egg.) Sprinkle over fruit. Pour melted butter over top, sprinkle a little cinnamon over top and bake at 350 for 30 minutes. Try it, I've gotten lots of compliments on this and it's simple and fast

I do not like store-bought cookies, especially Oreos (too dry and greasy for me). But upon the recommendation of several people, I tried the Ginger O's and was pleasantly surprised. They have excellent flavor and the cream does not have that greasiness to it. If you like ginger cookies, don't hesitate to try these

I love the Original Vanilla Creme Newman's O's, so when I saw the Wheat-Free/Dairy-Free on sale one day I picked one up. I figured it would basically be the same as the Original. The chocolate and vanilla tastes are great, but I found the cookies themselves to be rock hard. So unless you have an issue with wheat or dairy products, I would recommend the Original Vanilla Creme, and not the Wheat-Free/Dairy-Free variety

I really like the taste of these. I could eat them like candy bars they are so good in my opinion. Mabe not the healthiest granola bar around. But they are definitedly one of the tastiest the Yogurt just melts right into the granola on these just great. I even like the vanilla but really like the Blueberry and Strawberry. I wish they were a little bigger sometimes I eat 2 instead of 1 but I do recommend if you are worried about flavor these are top notch

Here in the shanty, where every grocery dollar has to be spent to maximize the calorie-per-buck quotient, we still find ourselves splurging on the best meal money can buy.

Hamburger Helper's Cheeseburger Macaroni(CM) concoction sates me in a manner no other food can accomplish.

Sure, the kids have to eat their peanut butter sandwhiches for supper so as to allow me to eat an entire pan of CM but I am the one needing the nourishment to arise every morning and descend into the mine for 14 hours to eke out the meager living here in America's proverbial Heartland.

I could eat CM for breakfast lunch and dinner and never tire of it sliding down into my bulbous belly.

Mighty fine stuff, girls and boys

My neighbor talked me into getting these because we are both trying to eat healthier and like to try new things.  Well, these are DELICIOUS!  They are my new favorite breakfast, even my children (2 & 4 yrs. old) like them.  They do share a cookie because they are quite large, but the size is perfect for me.  We had no problem with the two batches we ordered, both were very fresh and very chewy.  I stored them right in the freezer and would just pull one out as needed.  I'm reordering now.  Loved these

I had some reservations about trying new (relatively) "healthy" food products, but this double choc chunk breakfast cookie is a winner. I love to bake and have tried many cookies (both home-made and store-bought) and Baker's chocolate chunk breakfast cookie is in my top 3 favorite chocolate cookies. Not only is it pretty healthy (low fat, high fiber and protein), it tastes very good! My only concern for this product is its short shelf life, so you have to eat it pretty quickly. However, that only means that the product is made without excessive preservatives, unlike many other similar products on the market. I just love that I can pronounce everything on the ingredient list

Ahmad English Afternoon Tea is the best. I love to sample delicious teas from all over the world. I orginally bought a tin of Ahmad tea as a gift, for a discount at Marshall's around Christmas time in 2001. I had so many selections for the gift basket I was making that I ended up keeping the Ahmad for myself. Boy, was I ever glad I did. I haven't found Ahmad teas in any store since then. I've been ordering it online ever since, and re-filling the authentic tin it originally came in. During my breast cancer treatment (chemo, radiation & all that good stuff) in early 2005, I was able to enjoy Ahmad English Afternoon Tea, even when I couldn't keep anything else down.

This is the only green tea with echinacea that doesn't have any peppermint, and that was the reason I ordered it.  The taste is nice and after I've been drinking this tea for approximately a month, when nasty winter cold virus attacked everyone in the family one by one, I recovered faster than anyone else. Therefore, it is one more proof for me that Echinacea does help to strengthen you immune system. I would recommend this tea to anyone

These are the greatest. Light, not too sweet, delicious. AND high in fiber. Who could ask for anything more? Problem is, Amazon seems to always have a limited stock so they go fast. They should even out the supply:demand ratio and also offer the other 2 flavors on a more regular basis

These are great breakfast bars - low in calorie but high in fiber.  They are the only bar I've tried that keep me satisfied until lunch.  HOWEVER - they are very crumbly and don't stay together very well so can be mess if you're on the go in the morning.

This is really the best decaf I have tried... It is hard to find any better than the italian decafs like this one or Illy. Unless of course you are the average local coffee drinker used to embarassments like Folgers or accustomized to all the overburned and stinking like charcoal brands named for an unknown reason French Roast, Italian Roast etc... (believe me, they have nothing to do with French or Italian coffee). Not to mention the local decafs which taste more like tea made out of burned wood shavings...

My husband and I loved our hazelnut flavored creamer, but gave it, and its added calories, up as part of our New Years Resolutions.  This is a nice substitute, without the calories.  While it does not taste as good, it is a nice treat when you want a bit more flavor in your coffee.  We did not like the vanilla, and plan to try the mocha next

I read about these little jewels in a magazine recently and decided to try them.  I bought the Hazelnut flavor and love it!  Not only are the packs perfect for your purse or desk, but the flavor is true to Hazelnut and blends perfectly with the taste of Splenda.  I usually have a large cup of coffee for which I have to use two packets.  They aren't cheap so my recommendation would be one pack of regular splenda and one pack of flavored.  You won't be disappointed!  Try them!!!!!

This oatmeal is some of the best stuff I've ever had. I couldn't believe it tasted so good without any sugar or other additives. The packages are a lot larger than the average instant oatmeal package as well. This is cheaper than buying the instant oatmeals from safeway or albertsons.

Healthy, tasty, cheap.. what more could you want

I have never liked oatmeal.  When I saw this at my local Costco, I decided to give it a try.  Boy was I surprised!  I absolutely loved it.  It is the only brand of oatmeal I can eat.  Not only is it organic and made from steel cut oats, the flavor variety keeps the breakfast exciting for my family.

Sadly to say, Costco stopped carrying it and I was forced to go online to find it.  It is a little pricey here but, you get what you pay for

I've tried most of the instant oatmeals, and this brand has the best taste, while using organic ingredients. The variety pack is good so you don't get bored with one flavor. The price here seems very good, as I pay $3.89 for one box at the local health food store

If you like beef jerky, you will like this product.  I ordered it for my 25-yr. old son who expects a big bag of jerky every Xmas & no one was disappointed.  My only disappointment was realizing that I could purchase this flavor at Walmart for a substantially lower cost-per-ounce.

Well, this beef jerky is ideally-packed for snack size-wise, and it is softer to chew than some other brand. However, tastewise, it's nothing special. Not bad, but nothing special

This hot cereal is great. I've been eating it for years. Bob's Red Mill is the only vendor that I know of. They are local, but I'm glad they have it on Amazon now so I don't have to make the 1 1/2 hour round trip. It has an almost nutty taste. It is high in protein and fiber, and is fantastic with dates and milk

I first tasted this tea way back in the late 70's, when I worked at a specialty restaurant. Now I use it in my secret recipe iced tea, it adds a flavor that no one can identify, but one that they can't seem to get enough of!  It's also good hot, with cream and sugar. The taste is like lemon and nutmeg. I've tried other brands, but Twinings is the richest in flavor.

The shipment of 4 jars arrived with 2 of them broken, poorly packaged. Customer Service will replace them, though. And then I tried the sauce, just as is, over pasta with Parmesan cheese on top. DELICIOUS!!! Just hot enough to get your attention but not so hot that it would burn your mouth. Wonderful, I can't wait for the replacement! If it weren't for the poor packaging job, I would give it 5 stars

Annie's Creamy Deluxe Shells & Real Aged Wisconsin Cheddar is made with all vegetarian ingredients and even organic pasta. The sauce is made from cheddar cheese, cream, whey, dry milk, natural flavors and annatto for color.   

The 12-ounce box is enough for two to six people depending on how hungry you are at the time. We serve this as a side dish with many meals and normally can get about four to six servings from one box. 

When making the pasta, use a large stockpot filled halfway with water because if you even use a medium to large saucepan, it might boil over. The instructions say to use a medium saucepan, but I can't recommend that personally as it always boils over. Once you have the pasta cooked, all you do is add the packet of creamy delish cheese sauce. 
 
This is probably the only box of macaroni and cheese with information on where to get a "Be Green" bumper sticker. I also like the cute "Rabbit of Approval" sticker on the Annie's Homegrown products. They are all delicious (not overly salted) and you feel good eating such a healthy product.

This macaroni and cheese is the only kind that both the adults and the kids in our family enjoy.  It has a slightly sharp cheddar flavor that makes it taste so much better than the "processed cheese food" types.  Our whole family swears by Annie's Homegrown Deluxe Shells & Real Aged Wisconsin Cheddar and it is much cheaper buying them here than one at a time at the grocery store

I grew up a Kraft boy, and you wouldn't find me with off-brand boxes of macaroni and cheese.  No, sir.  Just the authentic and best for me.

When I got older, I realized (thanks to Mark Bittman's superb cookbook, How to Cook Everything -- if you happen to be in the vicinity of a bookstore, pick it up) that boxed stuff is horrid, compared to making actual pasta with actual cheese.  

But, well, sometimes I just want something out of a box.  (And our seven-year-old ALWAYS does, for he has the insane and tasteless taste buds of a child.)  In those cases, I always went back to Kraft, until we started shopping at Whole Foods and bought a pack of Annie's to try out -- very skeptically in my case, as I'd had a lot of off-brand stuff that failed to live up to the Kraft ideal.  Even so-called "premium" and "deluxe" stuff like the Velveeta Shells and Cheese was just totally weird and off-putting.

But, heresy of heresies, it turns out that the Annie's stuff is actually BETTER than Kraft.  Both the regular box with the powder, and this stuff with the cheese-gel, taste better than Kraft, through some feat of food science alchemy.  Try 'em out.  Personally, I give the nod to the Deluxe over the regular, just because it's twice as easy to make (no mixing milk, butter, and powder -- just rip the pouch and mix with the noodles), and "easy to make" is pretty much the whole point of boxed food; but it is a lot more expensive, so if you're price-conscious and willing to put forth a bit of effort, get the regular Annie's.

(Or, better yet, get that Bittman book, and learn to make pasta with sage and parmesan for the same price and just about as much work...

Annie's Deluxe macaroni and cheese comes with a pouch of cheese sauce, which tastes better than any dry powder variety and it is quicker to mix.  Regardless of how thoroughly I mix the cheese powder, milk and butter, the dry powder varieties do not taste as good as Annie's Deluxe.  Our 3 year old really enjoys Annie's Deluxe and I feel better offering her this rather than Kraft macaroni and cheese.  Even if the taste wasn't as good as Kraft, I would choose Annie's since the ingredients are natural and some are organic.  Kraft uses artificial color in their dry powder macaroni and cheese, though I don't think they do in their deluxe version.  Kids (and adults) don't need artificial colors!

I would give Annie's Deluxe a 5 if they would reduce the sodium content and make a Deluxe version that included whole wheat pasta  and was ALL organic (currently only some of the dry powder versions are all organic).  And while I am creating my dream version, I would give Annie's a 10 if they would enrich it with some calcium and other vitamins and make a whole wheat bunny shape version! :)  My big hangup is that the sodium is too high (like all the other brands).  It would still taste great with a lot less salt (if kids are not given high sodium in the first place, their taste buds don't crave it).  Unless pasta is whole wheat (or other whole grain), there isn't much nutrition in it, so whole wheat pasta that is enriched is the way to go!  Annie's  offers many varieties that include some of the improvements I am  looking for, but it would be great if they would include them all in one version.  

Boxed macaroni and cheese is truly junk food no matter who the manufacturer, but Annie's is doing great things to make it better.  Knowing that macaroni and cheese is often "kid food"  is reason enough to improve it nutritionally.

The price is reasonable on Amazon and at WalMart, however most of the grocery chains and Wholefoods charge too much!  The best price I found was at Annie's home website when they offered 25% off and free shipping

I love cherries so I thought I would try these dried cherries.  Common complaints on here include the sugar content- to them I say- check out raisins and craisins- they have it too!  These taste great- a handful is a good snack and I imagine they would be awesome in bagels/other baked goods

Ah, it's a definitly American story - in 1969 friends Mo Siegel and Wyck Hay of Colorado began selling the herbal teas that they had previously only made for themselves. From such small beginnings came that famous tea company - Celestial Seasonings.

Among Celestial Seasonings' many products is Peppermint, an herbal infusion that is based on peppermint leaves, pure and simple. Now, I must admit that I put off trying this tea for years; after all, I am not a big peppermint fan. But, I must say that this tea tastes great! I love this tea with a spot of honey, or with milk and sugar - it makes a great late night drink. But, it also makes a very interesting iced tea!

So, if you want to try a fascinatingly different herbal tea, then get Celestial Seasoning's peppermint tea

These are a little more crumbly than some of Nana's other cookies that I tried before I found out I should be on a gluten free diet.  But, they are a whole lot better than any I've been able to bake on my own.  They are good and spicy...just the way I like my gingerbread.  :-

I used this product as a supplement for my dog and her puppies for almost 4 months. Its high fat and protein content is needed for her ability to produce milk and keep healthy, and their energy and growth. I preferred the evaporated in cans rather than reconstituting the powdered version.

  I've been using the Stevia packets for over a year now and recommend it to everyone I know. Some of the packets do contain hardened powder, but this has no effect on the sweetness. As mentioned before, just put the Stevia in first, then add hot beverage. There is no need for the powder to dissolve, the sweetness is dispersed in the beverage and the remains (I suppose) are the inulin dietary fiber. They have been using it in Japan for 30 years with no apparent ill effects. From what I've read, the artifical sweetener industry put pressure on the FDA to have it banned in the 90's and that is why it has to be marketed in the USA as a dietary fiber and not a sweetener

I am thrilled with this product...the taste is great & the price was excellent!  Being a diabetic for 44 years & having used many artificial sweetner products during this time, I am so excited there is now an easily accessible product, which is natural & not filled with chemicals!  I'm hoping that the word will get out to diabetics everywhere, just how great SweetLeaf's SteviaPlus actually is.  Thanks so much!

Always liked the taste of darjeeling tea. True to the form, the really good stuff is quite expensive, but then there is Twinnings - to me it's the best of affordable teas.
Bonus for sloppy people: it's hard to oversteep. With many other teas if you steep it longer than indicated the tea taste becomes bitter and harsz. Not so with this one

Unquestionably the most refined of teas, Darjeeling comes from a region in the Indian (West Bengalese) Himalayas close to the Nepalese border, 7000 ft above sea level. Originating with the small-time, private, mid-19th century plantations of a British civil surgeon named Dr. Campbell, tea has long since transformed the region into a major economic center, with over 80 running gardens producing over 10 million kgs (over 22 million lbs) of tea on a total area of almost 20,000 hectares (approximately 75 square miles), and employing over 50,000 people on a permanent basis, with a further 15,000 being hired during the plucking season (March - November). The area's natural climate with its mixture of rainfall, sunshine and rich soil makes for a very distinctive flavor, and to be called "Darjeeling," tea *must* have been grown *and* processed in that particular region. 

Darjeeling tea comes in several harvest varieties or "flushes": the lighter Easter harvest or first flush, and the stronger Spring harvest or second flush, which has an unmistakeably fruity, Muscatel-like note. (There is also a Summer harvest or third flush, which is even stronger than the tea from the second harvest, but it is somewhat less refined and therefore less popular than the first two varieties.) Twinings' variety is a second flush tea with a subtle, quintessentially Darjeeling perfume; a great introduction to this region's exquisite teas that will hopefully make you curious for more

This peanut brittle has great taste and just the right amount of peanuts.  The pieces are a medium thickness and not too thin. The only negative comment I have is the can arrived with brittle in lots of small pieces, I don't know if this is due to shipping or not.

I followed the mixing directions, added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and these pancakes tasted very close to my Mom's homemade recipe but without the fuss. The pancakes have a tender texture and great taste. My family loves these pancakes and so do I.

OK, I'm eating this stuff, and I don't eat cereal. 

What's that tell you? It tells you it's pretty good.

And it's organic, so I tell myself I am helping out my body by eating it (which is probably not true.)

At $3 per box delivered, I don't think I'd buy this, but with an Amazon deal I got them for $2 each, and now I am considering loading in a bazillion of 'em.

This is a Prime member's find.

Maybe I'll mix in the rest of the flavors, 6 boxes at a time.

Comes to $.40 per bowl, not counting the milk and half banana

I am very pleased with the Timothy's Breakfast Blend.  This particular batch was from the "old" fill where the pods are rounded on both the top and bottom.  Remarkably though, they have not locked up my Senseo.  I'm pleased with the quality of coffee - especially for the price I paid.

I agree with another reviewer who said that these aren't as good as the strawberries. However, they are still quite tasty in cereal and I have also used them in baked goods like scones, where they add a nice flavor without turning the batter all purple like fresh berries do. Another advantage over fresh blueberries is that you never get any moldy ones

These are fine for cooking, they aren't that great for snacking though.  Very crunchy but the blueberry flavor isn't very strong.  The dried strawberries were so good I was a little disappointed when I opened these.  Maybe the strawberries were too good

Nonni's Biscotti is a good quality and tasty Biscotti. It is also available in most stores and supermarkets. Occasionally supermarkets have sales on Nonni's Biscotti, and when they do, It is much more cost effective then buying their product online which is higher priced. Overall, It is a good buy when Amazon can compete with those sales prices

Many of Bahlsen's cookies are too sweet and floury for my taste, but these light flaky cookies don't taste stale and are not too rich but are nice and do not taste like sugared cardboard.  I don't crave these but when you eat them, you realize that these are better than the average boxed cookies and unexpectedly delicate and fresh tasting given the supermarket price.

Ah, it's a definite American story - in 1969 friends Mo Siegel and Wyck Hay of Colorado began selling the herbal teas that they had previously only made for themselves. From such small beginnings came that famous tea company - Celestial Seasonings.

Among Celestial Seasonings' many products is Lemon Zinger, an herbal infusion that is based on lemons, hibiscus, rosehips and lemon grass. As you can tell from those ingredients, this tea lives up to its name, having a real lemony zing to it!

It wasn't too long ago that I broke out of my black tea-only phase, and began drinking herbal infusions; well this tea came as a real revelation to me. It's good hot, and I really enjoy it when I have a cold or similar illness. But, it also makes a great iced tea, with its lemoniness providing some great relief on a hot summer day. Overall, I love this tea, and give it my highest recommendations

This tea smells like lemon sours! What a great fragrance. This auburn shaded brew tastes lemony with a slight hint of lemon peel bitterness. I imagine it would taste good with some sweetener. Pretty good but not my favorite.

Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.

Quote from the box:

"The greatest thing in the world is to know how to belong to ourselves." Montaigne

They were great, my groom is a huge cashew fan as is my mom and both were more than pleased.  They are not heavily salted at all, we were pleasantly surprised, the salt is more of a fine powder than what you would expect from a salted product.  They always live upto having the best peanuts in VA, we send them to people all over the country and they are all hooked

I drink hot and cold tea now instead of diet soda.  After trying many different brands and types, I've centered in on Yogi teas.  They have great flavors.  I drink Green tea in the AM and switch to herbals once I get to the office.  Of the several Green tea flavors Yogi makes, I prefer the Kombucha.  Give it a try

I've had the other Nana's No Gluten Cookie Bars in Berry Vanilla, and they aren't that good. But, the Chocolate Munch flavor is good. They are more moist, have a good flavor and a little crunch. The only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is that the texture is a little bit crumbly. I will be buying these again

This soup is very good, I add some milk to it because it is a little too salty for my taste, but with that addition it is great.

This topping was more delicious than I imagined it would be on cheese tortellini. The ingredents are flavorful and fresh. The sauce is chunky and loaded with spices-- not a mild sauce, good for those who like food with a kick. I'm glad it came in a four-pack, because I want to share it with my friends

A crowd pleaser!  Bruschetta is simply and delicious.  Chunky tomatoes, fresh artichokes and black olive on crusty ciabatta bread is farm fresh and addicting!  Also fantastic over grilled fish, served with pasta or a pizza topping.  We love it as a dip with flat crackers!  Indulge and enjoy....Buon appetito!

Thinking beyond the ingredients is essential for our environment.  Our fresh sauces are made with convenience in mind (microwave, freezer and dishwasher safe - great to reuse for leftovers, storage, seedling gardens, art projects...your creativity is the limit.)  without sacrificing flavor

The sticky rice is perfect, just microwave it in the container it comes in for 2 min.  The paper thin wraps are very small and it is a bit difficult to roll.  The result is a bit of a mess but tastes great.  I put a small amount of crab meat next to the rice.  Each pack comes with 10 wraps, a container of rice, and one soy sauce pack.  The calorie count is 340.  But with 1/2 it is a reasonable 170 and is enough for a lunch.  I bought it when it was a gold box item for $10.  It is worth that, but I will not purchase again for a higher price.  Overall it is easy to make, tastes great and is a great option to have around since it does not require any refrigeration

I ordered this when it was the gold box deal and I would order again even at the higher price. Reading the reviews just reaffirms the old adage that you can't please everyone. I'm happy that there is no added flavor in the rice. The rice is quite tasty as it is. Have we gone to a culture that has to modify everything? In today's world we don't taste what we prepared to eat. We only taste the condiments we pour onto or into it. I thought the wraps where big enough. How hard can it be to roll sushi for goodness sakes. I thought the salt taste in the wraps added a little rush to the flavor when I bit into the sushi. All in all I think this is a great option to lunch and a good value. Having to roll your own helps you to slow down your eating and allows to feel full just about the time you munch on the last bite. Tomorrow, I think I'll add some tuna! Yummy

I really like the Nature Valley Cinnamon Granola Bars and have for some time.  However, I can no longer find them in the grocery stores in my locale.  The boxes of Cinnamon bars stopped being available some years ago, and recently they were no longer available in the variety pack either.  It was a pleasure being able to purchase them again

Garlic Chicken is my favorite Ensavor flavor - not too sweet, not too sharp, not too "garlicy". 

As a diabetic, I need to eat six times a day, even when I'm on the road. When I have a microwave available, I use it. But when I don't, I park my car facing south, leave the pouch on the dashboard, and heat it up that way. 

Each Ensavor meal is ready to eat, nutritionally balanced, and portion controlled. Getting hungry while away from home used to cause me great anxiety, as my tradeoff was a diabetically unsound meal vs. delaying my eating, and enduring headaches and light-headedness. Ensavor really satisfies. Bravo

These are very handy, I know they are more expensive than buying the big box but no clean up in the morning is great, just a spoon and I'm off to work.  I had bought the larger size earlier but these are a better size for me.

I am on a diet so these make the perfect mid day snack. 24 mini wheats per serving and I love that they are made with whole grain wheat which makes them filling. I haven't tried them with milk yet, but the strawberry frosting helps with my need for sweet. I am definitely going to buy more

As a fan of frosted Mini-Wheats I love trying all the new flavors and the strawberry delight flavor was on my mind. I expected them to be a little sweeter, but they have a delicate strawberry flavor that tastes very natural. The pink milk looks pretty with these little bites of tasty crunchy wheat floating around. Sort of a pleasing aesthetic experience that makes these perfect for an afternoon snack.

NOT instant, as the package says. To be fair, the package does also have, in somewhat smaller and less prominent print, a detailed statement telling the buyer that microwaving/cooking will be necessary. BUT if you just look at the package front, you'll get the impression you can make this like you make instant oatmeal. Not so.

I hate using microwaves, so that was a big turn-off for me.

All that said, the stuff is delicious and definitely warms me up and fills my tummy, keeping me from getting hungry better than most oatmeals do.

The texture is thicker and heartier than regular instant oatmeals, kind of a cross between a light muesli and oatmeal. I make mine, add about 2 ounces of organic skim milk, and I'm good to go. The sweetness is light and wonderful, no overly-sugary yuckiness.

Both my mom & sister are gluten intolerant, so I have used many gluten free products to make cakes or other recipes for family get togethers. This is the best cake mix by far....This cake mix is just as good as wheat-based mixes. I modify it to make various kinds of cakes: coconut cake, red velvet cake, etc. It always gets rave reviews, even from those used to eating wheat-based cakes. (My mom & sister can tolerate vanilla pudding, so I add one third to half a box of instant vanilla pudding - regular, not sugar free - per bag of cake mix to make it extra moist.) I also use The Gluten Free Pantry's chocolate truffle brownie mix; it is better to me than any wheat based brownie mix

Savory Choice is the best stock I've found and I love everything about it.  First off, it's flavor is incomparable to any other pre-made stock product and it really tastes like what chicken stock is supposed to taste like. I shared it with my grandmother and it won even *her* stamp of approval.    Secondly, I love that it is concentrated so that you make up just the amount you need, which is especially handy when you are deglazing a pan to make a sauce, for example; you don't end up with a whole quart container going bad in your fridge.  Finally, if there's anything I learned from NY apt. living, I love how small the footprint is of the box, itself.  It's also great to pack for backpacking trips, to keep in your desk at work, etc.  
They make chicken, beef, and turkey and around the Bay Area, it's available at Whole Foods, Berkeley Bowl, Andronico's, etc.

I've used this Savory Choice product for over a year and can recommend it highly. It is delicious and easy. Inside each individual packet is a thick liquid: just add it to a cup of water to make the broth. This is not like the low-salt, low-fat powders or the canned products but more like broth you've cooked from scratch. Comes in beef, chicken, and turkey flavors. I keep it handy on my RV as well as in my kitchen

These three sauces are delicious. I think that probably the most difficult part of Indian cooking is getting the right combination of spices and flavors for the sauces. These sauces from Taaza do the hard work for you. In practically no time you can create delicious meals by adding your own fresh ingredients. You can add whatever vegetables, meat, or seafood you may have on hand to make complete meals. For example, I may add shrimp, bell peppers,and onions to one of the sauces. For another sauce I may add potatoes, cauliflower and chickpeas. You can come up with your own combinations (even though the combinations may not be authentically Indian, the sauces make it seem like they are!). Also, by reading the nutritional charts on the bottles, I know that they are healthy (unlike the food in some Indian restaurants that are loaded with calories). I know that I can feed my family rather inexpensively with these sauces and they taste like they came from a restaurant. And...my kids love these sauces too

This alternative trail mix is a uniquely delicious treat.  I bought it because I love cashews and thought it would make a great snack.  It did indeed!  I ate the entire bag in one sitting and had to run out for more.  It's a healthy snack and a great alternative to trail mix.  While I haven't tried the other flavors yet I'm sure they are just as tasty!  You won't be let down with this wonderful snack.  Enjoy

I first tried this nut and spice delight at Costco........I had some of the samples that were offered that day and I choose to purchase the Sing Buri. My goodness this is good!! The flavors are just right. You know how a really good (Asian or French) sauce holds together and has a progression of flavors? I found that this happens with the nuts and chili and lemongrass.
Really, this is a gorgeous snack and healthy too!
Now that Amazon is offering this company's products, I ordered 2. And with the nice 10 bucks off, this is a very nice bargain!
Depending on your palate (some folks are happy with Planters nuts you know), I think you will be delighted with this choice!
Scrumptious

I don't usually buy this cereal in the supermarket because it can run almost $5.00 a box in manhattan but when I saw it here I couldn't resist at a little over $3 dollars a box.  All the nutrients and fiber that you can cram into a 24.5 box and a great taste too.  Jam-packed with raisins,almost a guilty pleasure.....and the flakes hold up longer than most other cereals of this type

I've always wanted to try gourmet salts, but didn't want to risk spending the money in case I didn't like them (or they ended up all tasting just like regular salt).  Dave's Gourmet offers a great way to try six varieties, all in one convenient shaker.  Amazon offers these salts as a three-pack, making them a good value.

Each salt really does have its own distinct "flavor".  Warning: the Eurasian Black Salt has a VERY strong sulfur odor and taste (I used it successfully in a tuna salad recipe in place of hard-cooked eggs).  The Smoked Salt is just as the name implies: salt crystals with a natural smoke flavor, excellent for giving indoor-cooked meats a just-grilled taste.  The other four salt varieties are milder tasting and offer a nice change to standard table salt (Hawaiian Red Salt can really liven up the look of bland-colored dishes, such as pork or potatoes).  Keep in mind that gourmet salts work best when sprinkled on foods after cooking (heat can alter the taste a little).

I highly recommend this product

If you have kids sensitive to food colorings or are just trying to avoid artificial ingredients, these are great treats to have.  My children have only recently made the adjustment from commercial, artificially flavored and colored candies.  So, they are picky about organic treats.  These lollipops have passed the test with my eight children.  Their quality control seems to be pretty good (something I don't always see with organic foods), and the flavors and colors are really nice (not boring or tasteless).  I keep these on hand to trade for candies others give them that they are not able to eat (due to sensitivities with food coloring)

I LOVE the white sesame crunch.  It has just enough flavor to keep you munching.  It's better than a candy bar or bag of chips.  Hard to find in the area and no problem ordering it.  Same good quality - same great taste.  
I'd recommend it - but don't expect tons of flavor and spice - that it doesn't have.

This is a good snack to carry in a purse for when I need a quick snack.  It is high protein and low sugar which is good for my diabetes requirements.  Also it is easy to eat because of its small size.  I like the zip lock bag so that I can eat two or three and close up the bag.  I am always looking for quick and easy snacks for my diet requirements.  This hits the target and also hits the taste spot, too!

If you expect it to taste like fried chicken, you will be disappointed as the other reviewer was. BUT..........if you just enjoy it for how it tastes it is great! Quick meals galore, add to rice, stuffing, or pasta. You can even clean off the gravy and BBQ it! I think it is one of the better tasting "fake" meats around

After having this rice at a neighbors dinner party I ordered some for my family.  I was eager to eat it again and tried making the Rice Creole for lunch last weekend. 20 minutes later I mixed in some cheese and rolled it in a few tortillas.  Easy to make and goes great with any meal or as a meal itself..

This is the best breakfast cereal I have ever found. The low sugar content, whole wheat, and yummy blueberries and strawberries made it my favorite healthy breakfast and snack food. Now it has disappeared from store shelves and it isn't available online either. Kellogg's website does not list this product under the list of discontinued products. So why is it not available? My family used to purchase about 2-3 dozen of these per month and I know many other people bought this product. I find kids and adults searching for this product at grocery stores and looking dejected as they helplessly purchase some other product instead. I hope Kellogg notices that there's a market for this product

Kellogg's Fruit Harvest Strawberry Blueberry packs a huge punch with a great taste and it contains no fat, no trans fats and no cholesterol. It is relatively low in sugar and carbohydrates, too.

Despite the fact that this is one of the best tasting breakfast cereals out there I am disappointed in its vitamin content. The artwork on the box leads you to believe that this cereal just has to be very healthy for you. Yes, it has 25 % of your recommended daily intake of iron, niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, riboflavin, thiamin and folic acid; but I expected this product to be healthier still. I will take off one star for that to make this a four star review. 

It is low in sugar just as they say it is. However, if you aren't getting the proper amount of exercise you need, then the extra sugar in the strawberries, blueberries and corn syrup could turn into sugar inside your body. As always, when planning a diet, it helps to consult your physician before starting a new diet. 

Nevertheless, the strawberries and blueberries taste delicious--even when you eat this dry and drink milk along with it. Kellogg's Fruit Harvest Cereal offers whole grain which is an important part of any healthy diet. 

Overall, Kellogg's Fruit Harvest Strawberry Blueberry breakfast cereal is a great choice to start your day. Sure, it may not be the absolute healthiest cereal on your grocer's shelf but this cereal beats junk food by a mile. Buy some and enjoy today!

Love these because you can store the box in a cupboard -- no wasted refrigerator space -- and still have a good / quick meal ingredient.

My husband loves these as a light lunch or evening side dish served with butter and grated cheese. I love them in soup, especially a simple chicken broth soup -- to which I add a bit of black pepper, dill, and lemon juice.

The DaVinci tortellini are aso great

If you enjoy lemon poppyseed muffins (loaf), this is the mix for you. Plus, it is the easiest mix ever; takes just a minute to mix. Personally, I add about a tablespoon of pure lemon extract to the mix, just to kick-up the lemony flavor. My family and friends love when I make these muffins

Stash's Organic Pinhead Gunpowder Green Tea, Loose Leaf, is the best of the best of green tea's.  It is rich, smooth, and looks like liquid gold in the cup.  The tea leaves can be used 2 or 3 times, depending on how strong you like your tea, with good results and good flavor.

I've only made it with added nuts, but it always comes out moist on the inside, somewhat crunchy on the outside.  It has a nice strong chocolate taste and the ingredients are mostly or all organic.  It didn't come out as high as the picture on the box, but that's okay for a brownie

This is a delicious choice for breakfast.  I thought it wouldn't hold me from hunger for long because it was flakes, but it really does a good job!  It stays crunchy considerably well, and has just the right sweetness.  Tastes healthy, but not in a gross way :0) You feel like you are making a good decision to eat it.  Definitely worth it, because of the volume of cereal you get

The price of this product (and many others) via Amazon is excellent compared to the "Whole Paycheck" types of "healthy" supermarkets. I'm totally pleased with this cereal. It tastes great, but surely the sugar content boosts its taste appeal. Organic or not, sugar is sugar, and many have been advised to keep their distance from it. Nature's Path should consider using alternate sweeteners, such as, organic of course, brown rice syrup or raw blue agave syrup. The macrobiologists would be jazzed

I really LIKE this cereal, as opposed to..... well, this is something I can eat safely (without gluten). I put all those extra bags in the freezer but will definitely eat them up. Another popular GF cereal is so HARD and extra-crunchy that is beats up my tongue. This is quite tasty and just the right normal "flake" texture

Sometimes there is an unusual aftertaste in wheat free foods from the grains that are used as wheat substitutes, but I don't find that to be the case with this cereal. It gets a little soggy if you don't eat it quickly enough, and I add dried cranberries to give it a little more interest, but overall it is good! I do not find it to be too sweet-I'd say it's slightly sweeter than plain corn flakes

First, remember that you'll be getting a lot of cereal when you order this value pack - months worth if it's just for one or two people.  Fortunately, it doesn't have too strong or strange of a flavor so you shouldn't get tired of it.  I suggest adding a sliced banana or apple, or even a shake of a honey-sweetened cereal as it's not the most interesting cereal to eat on its own.  My biggest recommendation - do NOT eat it plain with soy milk, as the grain flavors reinforce each other to the point of being a bit nauseating

This is by far the best bagged popcorn I've ever eaten.  The smoked gouda flavor isn't really subtle, but who wants subtle in a snack like this?  It comes out and whacks you on the head--HEY, I'M POWDERED GOUDA--and has a great, full-bodied flavor.

I recently tried Oogie's Smoked Gouda, White Cheddar, and Sundried Tomato popcorn...WOW.  I've never tasted anything like it!  Very tasty with just the right amount of salt.  And to think these snacks are heart healthy.  My kids loved Oogie's!  It's great to have such a healthy, delicious snack to feed them after school.  I will definitely buy Oogie's again and serve at  parties, too!  If you love popcorn, do yourself a favor and buy this stuff.

This bruschetta topping is the perfect appetizer to throw together when guests drop by!  This balsamic vinegar tomato based recipe is perfectly prepared with chunky fresh (never from a can!!) tomatoes and plenty of imported greek capers.  

We prepare our bruschetta toppings in a traditional way by hand prepping, chopping, picking and visually inspecting every ingredient so that they taste like they were just made fresh; we then prepare them in small batches so you taste every delicious ingredient.  WARNING:  May have urge to consume the entire jar upon opening!  Buon appetito!

I purchased the loose tea leaves from Amazon at a fair price & quick shipping.  English friends suggested PJ Tips Tea, which we ordered from another online site.  Twinning's blows it away.  The Earl Grey & Irish Blend are great both on the pallet & to the nose

Grape Nuts Trail Mix Crunch are great. I remember the regular grape nuts that my mom had, yuck...she added almost as much sugar as there was cereal to make them taste good. But Trail Mix Crunch is a different story - they are great, nothing more needed. They added a little honey, almonds and raisins for more flavor and there are 5g of fiber per serving to boot! These are also easier on the jaw than plain grape nuts, they are not as difficult to chew, but still crunchy almost like a granola. Definitely a family favorite!

I would have to say that the only downfall is the price...they could be a bit less expensive, which is true of most granola-like cereals.

I order this product all the time from Amazon.  It's an excellent cereal...delicious...great for your diet and digestive system.  I'm actually writing this review to commend Amazon on their customer service.  I have ordered this many  times and each order has come quickly and with no problems.  My last order however did present a minor problem.  I contacted Amazon and IMMEDIATELY received the BEST customer service I have ever received from any company...both on line and off.  I would never hesitate to order anything from Amazon.  You can count of them to handle each and every order with the upmost consideration and superior service.  Sometimes there might be a slight delay if a product is backlogged but aside from that you can trust Amazon to give you the BEST SERVICE POSSIBLE!!!  Thank you Amazon

I normally love nice fruit combo's but have found that most mixes (especially powder mixes) don't cut it.  This one honestly was not bad.  Now, mind you, it still has that Crystal Light Taste, but if you are a fan of their other mixes, then you should be ok with the taste :).

I would say that it is worth the Money

I have been a long time lover of black licorice and dark chocolate. But since  recently discovering RJs, I would have to say, if given a choice between a piece of the best dark chocolate and a piece of this licorice, hands down I'd be going for the latter. I was astonishly surprised with my first bite - wonderfully soft and intensely flavorful.  I enjoyed the fact that it didn't stick to me teeth or make me feel that I was having to give my mouth a workout to enjoy it.  Amazon offers this at a great price too.  I've paid considerably more

I just love this black licorice.  It's soft, it's chewy and oh soooo
good.  I've loved black licorice since I was a child.  This is the closest
licorice to what I had when I was little.  When I was a kid, there was a little store around the corner of my grandmother's house and they used to sell little boxes of soft licorice.  I haven't been able to find that licorice since the store closed. I keep stocked up with this licorice, too. It's the only candy I eat

I purchased this candy for my father and my father-in-law.  They both thought it was some of the best licorice they had ever tasted. They liked the fact that it was soft and easy to chew but the outstanding characteristic was the flavor.  Both of them could not stop talking about the natural, "old time" flavor of the candy.  I think they will be disappointed if I don't buy it again

You can get real licorice in New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, The Netherlands, Sweden, England, Finland and even Denmark. But not in the US. We use anise oil. Real licorice is found in RJ's and it makes a huge difference. The flavor is akin to dark chocolate and very nice if you are a licorice fan.

I have an old, rather beat-up percolator that I bought for $1 from the neighbor lady during a garage sale. It is terrific. Easy to make the coffee, the coffee tastes great and it takes up little counter space. But I would get these grounds in my coffee cup, and I didn't like it.

Enter the percolator filter! These are great, because the grounds really have no where to go. My grocery store used to carry (but have stopped, which isn't good) the disc filters, which just sit under the grounds, but don't wrap around them in any way. So the grounds can still sneak into my cup (though it is better than nothing). 

Also these make disposal easy. Just tip your percolator basket thingie (I have a percolator but am clearly not an expert on them) upside down, the filter falls out and you are ready for another pot of joe. 

Thank you, Melitta

Here is proof that a cereal can be good for you. Nature's Path HempPlus Granola Cereal is Low in Fat(5 grams per), low in carbs (about 25 grams per vs 45+ for a regular cereal), moderate in fiber and very low in sodium. PLUS is has healthy omega 3 fats from the Hemp seeds.

Nature's Path HempPlus Granola Cereal has a mild sweetness that is very pleasant and is not over powering. It is easy to chew and not hard like a lot of other granola based cereals. In milk is is very tasty and doesn't get soggy for quite some time. It is ever delicious right our of the box.

Bottom line: this is one great tasting and healthy cereal

Agreed, there's no reason for these people to put in so much salt.  On the other hand, there's no way I'd confuse this stuff with Campbell's.  Like most cream soups, it benefits from a bit of added milk, but we like it a LOT

 I buy Baxter Soups by the case because I am disabled and can't get to the grocery store.  These soups are restaurant quality and with a dollop of sour cream, you have a real treat.  Smooth as velvet, they will have you either gulping them down and wanting more or savoring every spoonful

My kids love their Macaroni & Cheese but one day all we had was a generic brand.  They didn't eat it all that well (Kraft really is the best) so I decided to try to make it a little better for them.  Follow the recipe on the box with a couple exceptions.  Put one slice of velveeta chees in while melting the butter (I melt the butter while the noodles are draining so as to melt the butter and velveeta faster) and add 1/3 cup milk.  What you'll have is a less expensive version of the really creamy macaroni and cheese that Kraft sells for a lot more money.  By adding extra milk and cheese they're even getting more calcium.  My kids love it when I throw in hot dogs and even peas so feel free to throw in other things since it's so cheesy (the extra cheesy sauce will take things like peas that kids don't normally eat and make them taste good).  Give it a try and see what you and/or your kids think

These are tasty on their own but i especially like them crushed, tossed into some yogurt with some blueberries or bananas. The only problem with this is that even in bulk Amazon is expensive. When they are on sale it's usually 2 dollars per box so the equivalent quantity to what they offer here is 12 boxes which would be 24 dollars. Amazon is selling it for 33 dollars

I use Bob's Red Mill wheat gluten flour for making seitan, a wheat-gluten "meat" familiar to vegans and vegetarians. It is very easy to use, is obviously high-quality, and keeps well. I've found Bob's works the best out of all the brands for this use. I just wish that it was organic and that they made bigger bags (the case comes with a lot of packaging, which seems like a waste)

I just got a case of these last week and I am back ordering today.  I purchased these because I am a diabetic.  I look for lower carb, high protein, high fiber products.  These are the best snacker that I have found yet.  I have tried genisoy, kay's and others, but none compare to the fabulous texture, crunch and perfect seasoning.   I was so impressed, I shared with my 23 year old son for his opinion.  He asked to have a bag to himself because they were so good.  He compared to a ranch-style corn type pringle chip without all the greasiness. I am also ordering the bar-b-que style because the ranch was so good

Though I'm not into so called "guilt-free" foods and eat mainly fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans and low-fat dairy, I have days when I need to make sure I get enough protein in a pinch.  These soy chips often fill the gap, as with a new baby in the house  (who is cared for full time by his mom in lieu of various mechanical and other devices such as swings, bouncers, teddy-bears with womb sounds, etc) I'm not cooking quite so much. Plus, I don't have much taste for meat, though I'm not a vegetarian.  

I don't eat many processed foods, and these soy chips are on the lower end of the processed side of things, in my opinion, as they don't have a bunch of dyes, perservatives, etc, just the soy flour, rice, oil, salt, spices...one could do much worse.

In particular, I have found them helpful for road trips when you don't know when you'll encounter something decent to eat (and don't have room for a cooler) and for plane trips.  Along with a few pieces of fruit, I've been carried through many a dicey food situation with these non-perishable soy chips.  A 2 hour ride to the airport, 2+ hour flight and average 2 hour luggage retrieval and dash to hotel or other lodgings is a long time to go without something to eat in these days of superb airline service.  Besides, who ever really liked, or much less could argue the sound nutrition of airplane food anyway?  

The chips pack a lot of heart healthy soy protein (about 24 grams per 385 calorie bag), are low in fat and in sugar.  Also, the bag can be compressed in to a much smaller size for carry-on economy if you don't mind some crushed chips.  They may not be a salad and healthy entree cover page meal, but they are a giant leap up from the vast majority of vending machine, convenience store, and grocery snack aisle trash.  The downside to them is that they do have relatively high sodium, but if the rest of your diet is pretty low in salt and you aren't having trouble with blood pressure, you're probably ok there.  

I really love the new amazon.com grocery venture because for one, I can get these soy chips in 12 packs.  The price works out to be  just over 50% of the cost per bag that I'd pay in any grocery store where I live.  When I two cases at a time to get over the $25 barrier, I get free shipping which really seals the deal.  My dad kids me that I'm an amazon.com junkie and whenever he sees a package from amazon.com in his box, he knows who's sent it.  This is not a prompted plug for amazon, I just really like their service, grocery especially

I originally discovered this pasta at my local QFC supermarket at $4.49 per 12OZ unit. The price point being a little rich for my blood, I only bought it on certain occasions. Buying it from Amazon in 6 packs at $2.33 per 12OZ unit and the free shipping option, along with the $5.00 off promo code that cuts back the per unit price about 25 cents, makes it a much better buy and now a regular addition to the dinner table.

Thanks Amazon for the fair deal and stocking Al Dente Pastas.

I was recently diagnosed with celiac disease, so I turned to Kellogg's corn flakes for my breakfasts, because I figured corn was safe. Little did I know that malt flavoring contains gluten! 

These were a serendipitous substitute - SO natural and tasty! It's refreshing these days to find a food with only three straightforward ingredients (corn, grape juice, salt). I ought to buy them in bulk!

My title pretty much sums it up.  The are light, crunchy little nuts with just enough salt to add a little punch.  My husband and I love these.  A great way to add healthy soy protein to your diet.  Great for on-the-go and at-your-desk snacks.  Won't fill you up, but will satisfy when you just "want a little something"

I think that some people have complained that this popcorn is bland, but that's what it's supposed to be.... It's a product that is as healthy as you want it to be- you decide. :)  Although I do like to add salt, I have found that I don't really care to add a lot of other flavors to it.  This is probably because my mom used to air-pop popcorn when we were kids (and add her own flavors) and it kind of reminds me of that.  I guess she didn't add very much. :)  It seems to "pop" better than other varieties I've tried and it doesn't leave you with greasy fingers.  Good job, Newman

We love the taste of Illy coffees when brewed in our espresso machine-- smooth, never bitter. You cannot distinguish the flavor of the decaf from the flavor of the regular espresso. 

AIlly's vacuum-packed canister has a unique, design and is reusable.

***** 
I enjoy Numi's Moonlight Spice Orange Spice White Tea. It has a distinctive orangey taste and a light spicy taste (from the cinnamon, cloves, allspice, and ginger), sort of like a light, subtle, orangey chai tea. It is different and unique and all of the flavors are much more subtle than a chai-type tea, quite adventurous. It brews for a lengthier time (7-8 minutes) and is worth the wait.

Moonlight Spice  is kosher, certified organic and contains amazing ingredients: organic cinnamon, organic orange peel, organic cloves, fair trade certified organic Pai Mu Tan white tea, organic hibiscus, organic allspice, organic ginger, organic schizandra berries, organic lemongrass and dried lime. The schizandra berry is a major tonic herb in Chinese medicine used to assist the body in dealing with stress, to improve memory function, and to assist with many various physical issues. 

There are no oils or natural flavorings used, unlike many teas; it is also sustainable in that all packaging materials are biodegradable and recyclable, the carton is made of 100% post-consumer waste, and cello wrap is not used.  Numi says that all their tea bags "are made of natural fiber paper, not the trendy, "silky" see-though nylon tea bags". 

On the box, the manufacturer writes: "Numi's Orange Spice White Tea is like no other. We use an abundance of all natural, organic ingredients for an authentic cup, without using oils or flavorings. This sublime tea ingeniously blends premium Organic White Pai Mu Tan tea with orange, citrus, and spice. Pai Mu Tan is exclusively the top two leaves and a bud of the tea plant and can only be picked the day before the buds unfurl. White tea is the least oxidized and processed of all teas, making it supremely healthy. Smooth and delicate, Moonlight Spice balances citrus notes of orange, schizandra, Numi's own Dry Desert Lime, and luxurious spice for the most divine experience. Transcend into a peaceful moment through its luminous hue and enchanting fragrance." 

The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but enjoy white tea, this will probably be one of the best you've ever had.

a local gourmet shop sells these for $3.50 each and just can't keep them on the shelves so I have to visit that store every week in hopes I catch the day he gets fresh stock.  since these sell on the web for over $5 each, I was thrilled when Amazon had them for almost $2 each when you buy a 12-pack carton.  I have only tried a half a dozen nutty flavors thus far, with my favorite being the Pumpkin.  However I stocked up on the Almond because they are very dense in healthy high fiber toasty almonds, just a hint of sweet and coconut, and you need only a few of these 1-2cm almond cubes as a snack to tide you over between meals

Twinings was founded in London, England in 1706, and has a long and respected tradition of producing only the finest of teas. English Breakfast tea is a mixture of black teas from Sri Lanka, which are blended to produce a smooth yet flavorful tea. Though often served during breakfast, this tea tastes excellent all day long. 

OK, let's get down to brass tacks - this is another great tea. Harder to over-steep than some of the teas I have known, it consistently produces a smooth and highly drinkable cup. Highly conventional in its taste, English Breakfast tea has a robust flavor that stands up well to lemon and milk, which makes it a favorite among those who like to accessorize their tea. Plus, I must say that this tea is wonderful iced - add some lemon and sugar, and you've got the right tea for a hot afternoon! 

And that's my review. If you want an excellent all-round tea, hot or iced, one that goes well with any food, then English Breakfast tea is for you. If you want tea from a great tea producer, them Twinings is for you. I highly recommend Twinings' English Breakfast tea to all, even those not normally into tea drinking. (Or, perhaps especially to those not normally into tea drinking!

Loose tea is so much better than tea bags.  I have two cups every morning, and sometimes want more.  Even the second cup doesn't get bitter or harsh.   Of course you have to drink it with no sugar or cream.

I've given this gift to a number of friends and I can never remember being disappointed by the reaction I received. The metal on the side is raised up to match the picture and is not stickered.   When the tea is gone.  This converts into a piggy bank. Good tea quality also

I've shifted to drinking Pura Vida coffee after searching for some time for a rich blend that is not too bitter or burnt.  This batch worked great for espresso and gets strong recommendation for that use.  I often drink coffee made with espresso roast to get a very dark cup of coffee and it was not terrific for that.  My preference is the Pura Vida French Roast for drinking coffee and this one for espresso

This fruit is great for a quickie cobbler. Just pour a can in a 9"by9" pan. Add cobbler topping (mix together, cup sugar, cup flour, 2tps baking powder, and 1 egg.) Sprinkle over fruit. Pour melted butter over top, sprinkle a little cinnamon over top and bake at 350 for 30 minutes. Try it, I've gotten lots of compliments on this and it's simple and fast. If you really want to have more fruit, try adding a can of rasberries to the mix!

I love these crackers for several reasons.  They are absoutely delicious, to begin with.  And they do not use ingredients like "partially hydrogenated soybean oil."  They are hard to find in stores.  It's a hit or miss thing, here in the Northeast.  So I ordered from Amazon.  Propmpt delivery, and ease of purchasing will keep me coming back

My son eats an organic diet, and I thought this would be a perfect snack. Oops, I received the non-organic variety. Contacted Amazon, no problem, keep those and we'll send you organic. The label said "organic" on shipment 2, but upon opening the box, they weren't organic. Amazon decided to refund my money. I really wanted to try the produce, and found another vendor, no problems and my son enjoyed these snacks. If Amazon could get their act together, I would order these again

I bought these for a snack for my five year old son to bring to kindergarten (per his request for fruit loops at snack time).  I needed to find a single serving size for each child in the class. Of course the children eat them dry... With this it allowed for him to bring them to school 4 times and serve everyone in his class. His teacher tells me they are one of the class favorites at snack time, easy to serve, easy clean up, economical........everyones happy!!

The muffins are plain without add-ins, but the box is a plain muffin mix, so you know that before you bake it.  I've added apples and apple sauce and cinnamon and they turned out great.  I've also tried blueberries and those turned out good as well.

The muffins have a nice nutty flavor and don't need any butter to taste good (I'm a butter fanatic, by the way).

If you like nuts and you're looking for a healthy, great tasting snack, you can't go wrong with Almond Crunch!  My husband and I recently eliminated high fructose corn syrup and partially hydrogenated soybean oil from our diet and we feel so much better.  Trying to find tasty snacks that don't contain these products is not easy so we were thrilled to find Mrs. Mays Naturals.  We love the Cashew Crunch as well

When I stumbled upon Sahale Valdosta Blend, I was in heaven.  It's healthy with a wonderful combination of flavors.  It's high in antioxidants and low in sodium and I can actually eat it (with all of my
sensitive GI issues).  I actually eat it for a meal when I'm on the road.
You've got to try it

These are soft, not leathery which is perfect for small children. There are no worries about choking and they are very delicious.
I gave these out at Halloween and at parties and the little ones and the parents loved them.
They are also great crumbled up into hot cereal and yogurt instead of sugar

I discovered these nut blends when Costco carried the large bag of Valdosta Blend.  Being a nut lover, the combination of pecan/pepper/cranberry sounded like a different twist, probably good on a salad.  Boy howdy!  They are great on salad, but are perfect straight out of the bag as well!  Yummy!  Yes, they are spicy.  Yes, they are different.  Don't be afraid of the spices...they add a whole new twist on a boring chicken dish or plain salad.  Enjoy

They're delicious, nutrious, and far more flavorful than most healthy snacks on the market.  For those who like spice and exotic flavors these are sure to quickly become a favorite.  I also really love the 2oz size, as it is just enough to really feel satisfied and not so much that you eat more than you should. I am hooked!

These are a great snack!  The pumpkin seeds are fresh and lightly marinated in Tamari.  They satisfy a salt craving without being too salty or damaging to the diet.  They're also a great source of fiber for those who are improving their diets.  We love them, and have even introduced them to other family members who were surprised by how good they were.

I was also pleased by how quickly they were shipped to us.  We had them within 4 days even though we used standard shipping

These cookies are great - a perfect breakfast when you're on the go.  My only concern about ordering them from Amazon again is experation dates.  I ordered a 24 pack of Oatmeal Raisin and a 24 pack of Fruit & Nut.  The Fruit & Nut's expired 3 weeks after shipment, and the Oatmeal Raisin expired 5-6 weeks from shipment.  I don't plan on eating them quite that fast, so I'll have a bunch of expired cookies on my hands.  I've got them in the freezer, so hopefully that'll do the trick, but beware nonetheless.

They're much cheaper here than at the Baker's website, (12 for $15 vs. 24 for $18), so if you don't plan on eating 2 a day, order them one pack at a time.  Baker's site does have a vastly wider selection, so maybe try them all first, then order from Amazon

I'm usually wary of food billed as "all-natural," as that often means "tastes kind of gross and has a weird consistency and mouth feel," but I decided that if I didn't like these, I could leave them at the office, so I ordered them anyway.  Fortunately, they're very good, chewy and sweet without being overbearing.  It's a good alternative to those super-tiny breakfast bars - it's not filling, but it's not insubstantial, either.  One or two of these, a yogurt, and a cup of coffee or tea could be enough, especially if you're not into eating much for breakfast.  Otherwise, it makes a very nice snack.

The only downside is that I got these on 11/21/06, and the expiration date stamped on the first one I tried is 12/10/06.  I plan on eating two a day, so I should run through 24 quickly enough, and if you're feeding a family, it won't be a problem, but if you're just getting them for yourself and plan on only eating them every now and then, you may end up with a few that will go stale or expire.  It's just something to bear in mind when ordering them, so that you don't order too many at once and then have them go bad on you

After visiting a local store, happen to buy a box and try it out... It was absolutely delicious.  Proceeded to hop online to see what prices were available and Amazon had the lowest (free shipping too) and bought 16 boxes.  Use it for everything from the topping on pies, oatmeal, cookies to just bake it in the oven and stick it in a bowl for substitute popcorn

I'm not ashamed to admit it...I like my rice pudding creamy and decadent. My first batch of this had the right texture, but I found the taste somewhat lacking. It had a "sugar water" quality to it, not very creamy at all, despite the fact that the mix contains milk ingredients. So with the next batch, I substituted 1% milk for water, and the result was much more satisfying---thicker, richer, and more pudding-like. 

I also made mine in a double boiler, which I would recommende. Takes slightly longer to cook, but you're much less likely to scorch the product. I think it makes for a thicker pudding also

Our son is an extremely picky eater and almost never wants to buy the school lunch. These make a really convenient substitue for sandwiches every day. We pack a cereal, a fruit and extra milk money. He can pour the milk right into the cereal container and throw the whole thing away when he's done eating. Takes 10 second to pack his lunch which is great for the morning rush!!

Best licorice on the market.  I don't normally like licorice but I was looking for organic products that I could eat and this stuff is good.  Normally when I think of licorice I think of real sticky or overly chewy.  This is really tasty and has just the right tecture.  If I had to nit pick I would say that the pakaging could be of the new aluminum bags that a German company develops that is non-plastic because plastic may not be safe for packaging food products but as far as what's available I recomend it with the highest rating.  No cancer causing anti-caking agents that they use in salt at least that's what der label says.  Again it has the highest standard of Organic which is USDA certified.  Placing 2nd order

Great stuff!  True Licorice with Molasses!  These are a good value... however, I noticed that the bars went up in price since I put them in my cart...  I'm just too slow to order I suppose

This is real licorice, not the licorice flavored candy you get in US supermarkets.  The flavor is very strong compared to what you find in the supermarket and it is more dense and chewy.

If you love licorice you will love this.

This Finnish licorice is NOT salty

The product may look like some kind of sweet treat, but it is not. Taste is somewhat bitter from cocoa, and somewhat sour from fruit, there is a very little of sweetnes. I think it is not tasting like you would expect from the looks, and that is why all the disappointment comes from. It is just different. We call it "fake candy" and enjoy with tea. very nice healthy un-desert

Healthy, filling, this satisfies the craving for a truly rich dessert. Craving chocolate? Something chewy? Sweet? It absolutely hits the mark. The nuts do not overwhelm the taste of it, they are chopped small and just enough to complement. I am so glad I ordered this box, I am sending one home to Mom too.
More proof that vegans can have it all

These dry roasted almonds are absolutely delicious and make a nice addition to any gift basket, christmas stocking or everyday lunch bag. However, this product will not meet the needs of someone looking for an "All Natural" product. The Amazon ad should be updated to exclude that sentence. If you're looking for a delicious, savory snack that's high in protien, but is a little different than run-of-the-mill almonds, you'll enjoy these

Amazing for a pre-packaged K-cup coffee. Forms a light, frothy head when brewed and has a deep, strong flavor devoid of any bitterness or burnt taste. Strongly reminiscient of coffee you might order in a Parisian cafe

We're always looking for healthier alternatives to carbo and sugar loaded snacks for ourselves and our kids.  Jerkey is one they seem to really like as do we.  I have been a long time consumer of SnackMaster's Turkey and Beef Jerky.  Unfortunately, my grocery store stopped carrying it so I decided to order it online.  If you check the ingredients of SnackMaster's Jerky there are fewer chemicals and preservatives then other leading brands of Jerky.  That's why we continue to be satisfied customers

R.C. Bigelow, Inc. was begun in 1945 by Ruth Campbell Bigelow, a tea connoisseur who wanted to offer even more taste opportunities to American tea drinkers. Among the teas that Bigelow presents is their wonderful Green Tea. Green tea is now very popular, due to its antioxidants and other health benefits.

Overall, I found this to be an excellent hot tea, with a wonderful smell and taste. But, that's not all: Bilgelow's Green Tea also makes a great iced tea! So, if you are looking for a delicious and healthy green tea, one that tastes great hot and cold, then get this one! I highly recommend it. (By the way, check out the interesting recipes on Bigelow's website!

This pudding is very easy to make - done in about 5 minutes.  The texture is not as good as a cooked pudding, but it's acceptable.  The chocolate flavor is very good, better than the regular chocolate flavor.  The combination of low calories and simple preparation makes it a winner in my book

These Pretzels are great!!  I needed an alternative to wheat and found these spelt pretzels.  I had them prior to ordering them on Amazon so I knew to expect they'd be awesome.  Several family and friends have tasted them and can't tell any difference to pretzels made with wheat.  However, I like these spelt pretzels better than your average wheat pretzel!
I don't like too much salt and I found these pretzels average on the salt factor.  Like every other bag of pretzels, the salt does comes off and settles at the bottom of the bag which is always fine with me.  
The only thing I don't like is that in the ingredients list they say made with Organic Spelt and also Spelt.  While they meet the standard to label their product organic, they should use ALL Organic Spelt

I e-mailed customer service and told them my problem and they wrote back telling me they could not ship just one can and they would ship me three more and I could return the two I had gotten.

They then said to go to a site and print a return label which the site would not let me do as none of the items I bought on that order were returnable.

They then asked me to tell them whether or not their answer solved my problem, I checked "no" and have never heard from them again on the subject

I recieved the variety pack today and tried this flavor first.  I buy natural snacks for my kids (freeze dried fruit etc with no added sugar), but I find them bland.  So I ordered these and I love them.  In fact my 4 year old wanted to try and she liked it - it wasn't too spicy for her.  You can tell they used "hot" spices, but they are very well done so as to not be too much.  The nuts are big and crunchy and the fruit is small and chewy.  There is about equal of both nuts and fruit.  They do use evaporated cane juice and organic tapioca syrup, but these are healthier than alternatives and there are still only 5 grams of sugar per 1/4 cup serving

We were first introduced to Twinings when we lived in Australia for a year and one-half. As uncultivated Americans, for us tea was tea. We learned otherwise in the company of those who knew. Now Twinings English Breakfast Tea is all we will buy. It does not have the bitter taste common in most teas. As the Aussies say, "It is smooth.

When I was younger, the only tea readily available in my area was Lipton orange pekoe. It was okay, but not great, and very easy to over-steep causing a bitter cup of tea. One day while traveling in Canada, I tried Twinings English Breakfast Tea. It was so good that I purchased a large amount of it to take home. Now it is readily available and the English Breakfast Tea is still my favorite. Every other Twinings tea has been very good, but I always return to my favorite.

You can read in the other reviews about the flavor. It is a robust, full-flavored tea that only turns bitter after grossly over-steeping. There are some very bad brands of tea out there, and a lot of good brands, but as far as I am concerned Twinings is by far the best

I first tried Lavazza Oro in Italy, and I really loved it. I bought this because I didn't have a coffee grinder at the time, and this was the only one that was preground and shipped through Amazon. It tastes very good, much better than Charbucks and much cheaper, too, and imported straight from Italy.

I think this brand of espresso T-Discs trumps all the others through taste, body, and color.  I usually have a double to get me going in the morning and this system is much faster (and way cheaper!) than going to the corner starbuck's. I recommend buying the Tassimo T-Disc Coffee Machine System first and stock up on these bad boys for this great price.  Plus, these are not widely available yet in my area and I've got to go to a specialty shop to find any

I have 3 kids and was looking for crackers for my kids and my snacker husband that have no additives, no sugar, whole wheat and are suitable for snacking.  I love these crackers and can safely leave them out on the counter for snacking.  No sugar means they don't get devoured.  They are very crunchy, which can be kind of weird at first(it also keeps you from eating 50), but there is nothing like a plate of these with a tiny slice of swiss cheese.  All my kids eat them, but my mom doesn't really like them.  Everyone else seems to like them - I should warn you that my kids are good eaters.  A super fussy eater probably won't eat them.

I used this gluten substitute to make the best sugar cookies my kids have had since they were diagnosed.  You only use 1 part of the gluten substitute to 5 parts of gluten free flour.  My first batch I used the same amount as for xantham gum and they did not come out right, then I did the math - 20 grams substitute: 100 grams flour and realized - DUH!!! 1 part to 5 parts and tried again.  OUTSTANDING RESULTS.

Naysayers - read the directions, do the math - and try again - you won't be disappointed

For me, Shock Coffee has a fine, roasty flavor. It certainly DOES give you a boost and a large one. I am an Arabica bean gal but I really don't taste the common Robusta bitterness. Not at all. What I do get is a full bodied start with a smooth finish. I really like it. The Shock-a-lots are awesome too!

This product is very good, but my wife and I agreed that it was impossible to tell you were eating sweet potatoes, rather than regular potatoes.  I expected the flavor to be distinguishable.  Oh well.  The only other caution is to not overcook this product.  It will start to get mushy.  That may be characteristic of any gnochhi, but I thought I would include this point as well

Wow! I cant beleive this find. Whole wheat gnocchi with sweat potato.  what a great combination. Cooks fast, can add white sauce, red sauce or plain with a spinkle of vegan parmasean cheese.  The price is great for a case.  Free shipping cant beat that

Sahale makes several nut mixes but the Valdosta blend is one of the Best.
Just enough pepper and sweet to satisfy with a small handful.
We always keep it on hand

We have really enjoyed these unusual snacks! We first got the variety mix and they were all pretty good but this mix is off the chart! No need to put these in a resealable bag they just don't get that far! I keep thinking how good they would be added to a meal as garnish or a salad. We truly love them! Thanks Guys

I bought the variety pack and tried this flavor third (see my reviews for Socorro and Soledad). I buy natural snacks for my kids (freeze dried fruit etc with no added sugar), but I find them bland. So I ordered these and I love this flavor. In fact my 4 year old wanted to try and she liked it - it wasn't too spicy for her. They use black pepper which is flavorful, but I wouldn't call it spicy.  The nuts are big and crunchy and the fruit is small and chewy. There is about equal of both nuts and fruit.  Valdosta has 7 grams of sugar in a 1/4 cup serving

I was skeptical at first -- could we commit to three bags of a coffee we'd never tried? -- but the Organic Mocha Java won us over at first taste. Rich but not overpowering, dark but not bitter, it is among the very best coffee we've had the pleasure of drinking. I'll never crave Starbucks again

Numi has created a breakfast blend with four of the most popular black teas--Keemun, Assam, Ceylon and Darjeeling. The aroma is a fine grassy floral tea blend. The leading flavor is Keemun, a malty, slightly smoky flavor. This is a smooth subtle cup of tea, without some of the more characteristic robustness of most Breakfast blends.  However, it is still a very stimulating blend--fairly high in caffeine I would guess from its effect!  Unfortunately, Numi does not list caffeine count on the box.

Numi gets points for their manufacturing process and packaging. The boxes containing their tea is made from 100% recycled paperboard from 100% post-consumer waste--they assert that by using such packaging materials they save 2,040 trees, reduce landfill by 131,200, and prevent 184,000 greenhouse emissions. Numi uses only 100% natural ingredients without added oils or "natural flavorings"

*****
Numi Tea's Morning Rise Breakfast Blend Black Tea is a premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher. The ingredients are fair trade certified organic Keemun black tea, fair trade certified organic Darjeeling black tea, fair trade certified organic Ceylon black tea, anfair trade certified organic Assam black tea. A powerful black tea blend indeed! There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.

On the box, the manufacturer writes: "Numi perfects the classic breakfast tea with this organic black tea blend, Morning Rise. Four of the most extraordinary black teas compose this hearty, complex, and exciting morning cup. Ceylon, gardened in the small and exotic country of Sri Lanka, bestows its strong yet smooth profile, while Indian grown Assam imparts a malty and robust depth. Keemun, from China, offers deep burgundy notes that complement the natural floral finish and fruity Muscatel of Darjeeling, cultivated on the mountain peaks of India. This rich, bold black tea blend has an unrivaled smoothness and a magnificent aroma resembling dawn's early warmth. Let the morning greet you through the radiant daybreak of Numi's superior Breakfast Blend." 

It tastes strong and and is perfect for people who want a black tea that is not flowery or herbal-y but tasty, complex, and superb high-quality in the morning.

The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love black tea, this will probably be the best you've ever had.

Many blueberries -- fresh, frozen, or dried -- are pretty tasteless.  So I always buy a bunch when I find some that taste good.  And these are consistently great!  Lots of sweet blueberry taste!  Not as organic as I claim to like, in that they've added blueberry juice and sweetner -- but the effect is wonderful

Honestly, I was a bit skeptical on ordering nuts online. Mainly for fear they would not be as fresh AND they would be broken via the shipping process. I am a baker year round and quality is of highest inportance to me. I am THRILLED to tell anyone else with these concerns, these nuts not only arrived quite fresh with a long expire date but so well packaged, breakage was of normal expectation, quite minimal, no more than if you picked them from a shelf at a grocery. Even though I chose free shipping, which can take a bit longer, they arrived in no time at all. I will not hesitate to continue ordering my baking needs from Amazon.com

I'm a granola bar fan, and I tried these recently and really like them.  Had one for breakfast about five minutes ago, as a matter of fact.  I can imagine a better granola bar, but it's pretty dang good.  If you're like me, you like to pack a variety of bars for camping/hiking/road trips so as to not fall victim to monotonous granola.  These are definitely a good addition to your bar repertoire.

I love this item.  The strawberries and bananas are nice and crunchy and sweet, with the tang of the strawberries complementing the sweetness of the bananas.  Eating this is addictive - but at least you can rest assured you're addicted to something healty, low calorie and delicious.

I wasn't sure about this tea at first because I had tried several other teas that contained licorice that were just too sweet for me. However, I'm pleasantly surprized by the light, tangy flavor of this tea. The sweetness is there, but it's not overwhelming. I'm not certain that it's done much for me in relation to "detox," but I certainly like the taste, especially after lunch. It seems to settle my stomach and help me digest

"...made without hydrogenated oils - which is a good thing since it's difficult for our bodies to absorb trans-fatty acids that come from hydrogenated oils." ~box 

These are definitely natural snack crackers to bounce around about. I mean, it is so rare to find even natural foods without hydrogenated oils. I can't count the times I've read labels only to be disappointed to find that "natural" does not always mean healthy. 

Ingredients: Certified organic wheat flour, expeller pressed safflower oil, aged cheddar cheese (contains milk, salt, enzymes, cheese culture), salt, yeast extract, paprika, annatto extract (for color), ground celery seed, onion powder, yeast. 

I've made my own cheese crackers and these really do taste homemade. About 24 tiny crackers will satisfy any cheese cracker craving and that is about 70 calories. 

These crackers are Bernie the Bunny (Annie's beloved mascot) approved. They are also made with only vegetarian ingredients. Each cracker is the cutest bunny shape.

My 6 year old & my 1 year old love these "bunnies".  They are a much healthier alternative to Goldfish, without the transfats & colours. The pricing was also good when compared to the supermarket price, if you are able to get free shipping

Although I didn't LOVE this product (I don't like cereal bars anyway), it was a good substitute for those on a GF diet. My son, 15 mos old, loves these bars and eats them almost every day! Very good, healthy, and you cannot tell it's gluten free.

My 5 y.o daughter loves these. Pricey, but these are so good for on the go snacks! They taste great, too. They are a little thicker than Nutra-Grain bars, but after going 8 months w/o them, my daughter doesn't know the difference. We always have these on hand for car trips or feild trips

My boyfriend has Celiac's and hasn't had french toast in years. I made the bread, in the bread maker, the day before and it was absolutely perfect! I don't have any problems with gluten, but I still think I would prefer this bread for french toast any day. It cuts better than fresh baked regular bread as well, meaning it won't collapse in on itself. I am looking forward to making more of it and experimenting with other receipes

This bread deserves rave reveiws.
Reliable results, even texture.
Makes a beautiful classic grilled cheese
on white. Success with bread machine.
Watch out for the metric to standard
conversion on the liquid amount. We almost put
in half the liquid on the first loaf, we adjusted
it roughly and the loaf still came out.
I think in some areas, desert, high altitude, the
liquid my need to be fudged up a little.
Experiment, have fun!

These crackers are the best-tasting saltines we've ever had.  We LOVE them!  They are light, not too salty, with a delicate smattering of olive oil.  The ingredient list is short --only four items!  I buy them by the case for our family of four and they don't stick around long enough to get stale.  They are GREAT to take along to a party if you're serving crackers and cheese.  I strongly recommend them.

I ordered these crackers about two weeks ago, not knowing how they would be. Turns out they are delicious! A little plain tasting, which was expected, with just the right amount of salt for my tastes and a subtle but pleasant hint of olive oil. They seem to go very well with several cheeses, soup and on their own, too. I recommend them to anyone who likes Saltines or other plain, salted crackers - however I find these to be significantly less salty than Saltines. Enjoy

I am a dark chocolate lover, and have long wished that there were an instant cocoa mix flavored with dark chocolate.  I was very happily surprised to find "Dark Chocolate Sensation" at my grocer's last week, but after actually having a cup, I began to get very worried.  So many times in the past, I have been disappointed by the unexplained disappearance of a product which I loved, and purchased faithfully.  I do not want this to happen again, but just in case it does, I am stocking up all the Dark Chocolate Sensation I can find.  Whenever I go shopping, I go to every store in the area, just to get all their DCS cocoa mix.  PLEASE KEEP PROVIDING IT FOR ALL DARK CHOCOLATE LOVERS!  WE ARE LEGION!

I bought these without trying this particular flavor. Aren't I brave? You get a pack of 60 no less! This is a thick and somewhat tasty blueberry flavored fruit bar. Much thicker than a fruit rollup but not as thick as a granola bar; the texture is quite pleasing and very chewy.

Flavor is decent and complex: not just blueberry.  With the product tag line of "an apple in each bar" it's no wonder I taste apple along with some other flavors I can't put my finger on.

This would be good for a snack or when craving something sweet. But I don't expect it to tide me over until a meal. 

I hope it replaces my need for chocolate to satiate my sweet tooth. It better, I have 60, no wait, 59

Tastes too good to actually be healthy.  Sound too good to be true?  I thought so, but it is really true.  Nice job Kashi.

If you have never eaten Kashi products, you are in for a treat.  There are some I like better than others, but for food that is good for you, it is a pleasant surprise

Add your own fresh fruit to Special K rather than eating these colored apple pieces

I have always liked Special K.  Nowadays, it is all about brand extension.  So, they add some things to the basic cereal so you don't have to add your own banana or berries.  While I enjoyed the taste of the sample I was given, my advice is to go with the basic cereal and add your own fresh fruit.  The fruit here, and the box shows pictures of berries, is really made of apple pieces that are colored and artificially flavored to taste like some kind of vague berry taste.  

If you find adding your own fruit too troublesome, well, this is a good and tasty choice

My girlfriend has been eating Special K and I decided to start the Special K diet too.  We recently both tried the Fruit & Yogurt variation and it's definately my favorite of the variations.  On a side note - I seem to be pooping less and feeling less full.  Which is great. I spend way too much time in there reading books anyways. Im happy, my girlfriend is happy and everything is fine and dandy. Life is great but Special K is better

*****
If you love bergamot (as I do) then this is your tea.  Numi Tea is all high quality, and this aged Earl Grey is no exception.  It is a strong, fine tea, and the bergamot is the star.  

This tea is certified organic and contains just Organic Assam Black Tea TGFOP Grade 1 (Oxidized Camellia Sinensis) scented with organic Italian Bergamot Fruit (Citrus Bergamia).  It is also kosher.

On the box, the manufacturer says it better than I ever could: "Numi's special Earl Grey is oil-free, using a unique method of aging premium Italian bergamot fruit with malty Assam black tea.  When brewed, it imparts an exquisite red-orange hue that calls to mind dawn's finest moments.  Balanced and stunning, we've recreated this timeless classic."

The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes.  If you like Earl Grey tea, get it---you won't be sorry.

The dieter who couldn't eat a whole package in a day must have been eating these tasty little gems one by one, with a break inbetween each bite. Not my family.  We would each take a handful for a snack, and before we knew it, the bag was empty.

But enough about the bag.  These things are tasty and provide a concentrated strawberry punch of flavor which makes "strawberry flavored" items taste lame.  With these, you get the whole range of flavors in a strawberry, sweet without being too sweet, and none of the acidic taste that you sometimes get in an underripe berry.  The dried fruit is very crunchy, without any of the gumminess that shows the manufacturer removed them from the dehydrator too early.

My only beef is the price, although I understand why they are so expensive.  When I dried fruit, it took many pints of cleaned, stemmed and sliced berries to come up with a respectable amount of food.  My family was always finished with one batch long before the next before the next was ready. When I consider the effort involved, these snacks are probably underpriced.  But it still hurts to see an expensive packet gone before the commercials are over

Both my 2 yr old and my husband like this cereal a lot.  And I didn't even mind it when I had to eat GF for a short time.  I love to use it as a bread crumb for chicken nuggets or fried chicken. I just pop it in the blender and get it really fine. It has a nice sweet taste to it which makes it perfect for breading.
I only wish that it had some more nutrients in it.

As a fussy vegetarian, I have tried many vegetarian seasonings to use with my homemade soups, and this is the BEST!

Update: One star. I had based my previous 5-star review on the taste and the natural ingredients. Well, after receiving my shipment and reading the label, I was disappointed to find Nutritional Yeast Extract as the number one ingredient. From my research, Nutritional Yeast is good for you, but Nutritional Yeast Extract is not good for you - in fact, Nutritional Yeast Extract has the same negative effect on your body as MSG. So even though the taste is great, I won't be recommending this product any more

I've been using this for a couple of months.  I usually have a small mug of broth in the evening with slightly less than a teaspoon of mix in 8-10 ounces of boiling water.  Very refreshing and only about five calories a serving.  I haven't counted how many servings per cannister I get, but I would guess that it is at least the 40 indicated on the label, so this works out to be a very inexpensive as well as refreshing drink.  I've also used it a couple of times in rice-cooking water and it is very tasty, if not quite up to my home-made vegetable broth for this purpose.  It's a lot easier, of course

In the last year I've developed a real yen for these sour chewy candies. I've sampled about a half-dozen varieties of sour worms, including the bulk tubs sold at the grocery store, Blockbuster, CVS, etc. Some taste quite synthetic, but these Harmony worms immediately impressed me with their pleasing, almost fragrant fruit flavors. However, they barely qualify as sour---quite mild on that scale, so I nicked them one star on their rating.   

Be careful to never leave these in a car on a warm day---even slightly warm day. They melt into a solid mass very easily

I love boysenberries, blackberries and mulberries.  Mm, mm Mm, the darker the gentler. The light syrup is not too sweet so I don't mind spooning it in along with the berries.  The berries are mushier than firm but not mush and still somewhat shapely.  It was not difficult to finish a can

One can sells for 3.39 at my local grocery store, so with this special, it's about 2.16/can for 2 8 packs. What a bargain w/ FS. The fruit is soooooo tasty. I usually buy frozen, but this canned is better, so I've converted. I confess I eventually ate a whole can during one evening as a healthy plain fruit dessert since I kept going back for "seconds" a few times. Truly the next best thing to fresh

I bought these based on the great reviews and I can say I am not disappointed!  When I brewed my first cup, there was an overwhelming scent of coconut so I was a little worried it would be too "coconutty".  I'm happy to say that it's the perfect blend of chocolate and coconut--neither taste outdoes the other.  I will definitely buy this flavor again

Wow, this stuff is good! If you like caramel corn, you will love the Caramel Booty. It's got a good amount of sugar in it, so this is definitely not a low cal treat. But compared to the heavy-duty sugar on regular caramel corn, this is much better, not to mention easier on the teeth. The caramel coating is much lighter so doesn't get all stuck to my teeth. No added vitamins either like some of the other booty products have.

I have to admit I love these cookies too.  It's a crunchy lemon cookie, in the shape of a polar bear, covered in a white icing.  They are sweet and very yummy. We took them on a picnic once and the icing got pretty soft but that still didn't keep the kids out of them

My 4 yr old was recently diagnosed as a Type 1 diabetic.  As with most 4 yr olds, she likes very few foods and wasn't getting an adequate supply of protein.  With the diabetes diagnosis, it was evident to us that we had to find something fairly nutritious, low in sugar, and high in protein that she would eat or she would become hypoglycemic.  SHE LOVES THESE!  This is one of her daily snacks and she's now beginning to thrive!

I wanted to give these soy crisps more justice than just the 5 stars (and ordering them all the time).  I bought a bag of these Sea Salt flavor crisps and a bag of BBQ crisps about a month ago, in a bid to eat more healthy food.  I've always loved BBQ chips, especially Ruffles and Lays K.C. Masterpiece chips, but they've got to be killing me slowly, right?  So I busted open the BBQ soy crisps and gagged.  How could this be BBQ?  They tasted like cardboard, and I gave them to my friends who will eat anything.  I begrudgingly opened the Sea Salt bag, and though more palatable, I was still disappointed.  (I know..."I thought you said 5 stars."  It gets better.)

Anyway, I had sworn off chips and midday snacking, so for two weeks I saw nothing on the counter but Genisoy Soy Crisps.  I'd eat two or three here and there, and when I ran out, I bought 2 bags of the Sea Salt flavor again.  What happened must be akin to rebooting your computer or defragging your hard drive--my body forgot what those strong BBQ flavored chips were like, and I started craving Soy Crisps.  I began to taste a delicious roasted soybean flavor, like those roasted and salted soy beans they sell in jars, which I had completely missed before, apparently because it wasn't a sweet, red-crusted, overbearing BBQ powder.  I polished the next bags off in three days.  

Now, I'm ordering 12 here on Amazon ($1 cheaper per bag than my local grocery store which seems to want to punish my wallet for trying to eat healthy food).  My advice is this--give these soy crisps a chance, but don't mix them in with your regular Doritos and BBQ Ruffles or you'll think they're awful.  Stop eating, for a month, the oily BBQ chips that have deadened your taste buds for years and reboot your taste buds with these markedly healthier chips.  You'll feel better about snacking

The every day Amazon case price is about the same as the sale price. I've been eating these for years and they are a very good source of protein. Soy protein is about the best you can get. LOw fat and carbs. 

In 17 crisps you get 120 calories (25 from fat), 17g total carbs, 2g dietary fiber and 7g of protein. ZERO Trans fat, 0 Saturated fat and 270mg of sodium. 

Much better than steak in my opinin. After all, you'll never hear of "Mad Soy Bean" desease

I tried this tea in the flowering combo that came with the teapot box. Now I'm here to buy it on its own. It's the best in the assortment in my opinion. 

Just as you take a sip, the sweet scent of jasmine combines with the lush flavor, and WOW! A real delight. The tea is very light and subtile yet strongly jasmine. Then there's the flowering effect. This is my favorite bloom of them all. All these tiny little tea balls slowly unwind, dancing under water, swimming and growing until the pot is full of delightful little flowers. Absolute perfection.\

And it's good for your body and the planet. :o

If you judge this snack by the packaging, you might never try them. Baked pea pods don't exactly sound like the most appetizing (or satisfying) snack, but these guys really deliver.  As one of the other reviewers said, they are crunchy and light, with a texture similar to Cheetos, possibly a little more dense.  They have the taste of lightly salted snow peas, only light and airy.  While they might not be as healthy as a raw or steamed vegetable, they're a good alternative if you don't want all of the chemicals and sugars in most packaged snacks.  These guys have no sugar at all and the ingredient list is wholly recognizable.  I usually buy two bags at a time because they tend to go so fast.  Both flavors are delicious, though I prefer the original. 

Since it appears that Amazon is no longer carrying them, you might try Wild Oats, Trader Joes or Whole Foods, if any of those are nearby

My first experience with this cereal was with a CASE of it from amazon, so thank goodness it was good! You'd think it be hard to mess up gluten-free rice cereal, but believe me, there are some awful ones out there. This, with the welcome addition of fruit, is wonderful. I've never had freeze-dried berries before, either, and they were tasty (please make one with more blueberries!). I also bought the Erewhon brown rice cream; if you're missing oatmeal for breakfast because you're sensitive to gluten, try the brown rice cream... with brown sugar and raisins, it's actually pretty good. I highly recommend this cereal

I have tried so many artificial sweeteners, I think they are all horrible. Someone finally convinced me to try Splenda last year and it has made a huge difference in my life. I just use Splenda in my coffee, instead of sugar now, and I have lost 20 lbs. in the past 4 months. At first I admit that my coffee didn't taste "exactly" the same as with sugar, but it wasn't bad and it didn't taste like an artificial sweetener at all. After I continued using nothing but Splenda in my coffee for a few weeks, I couldn't imagine putting sugar in my coffee again. I have now used it for about 4 or 5 months and I even carry a few packets around in my purse in case I need them when I'm out. I would highly recommend Splenda to anyone that uses sugar on a regular basis. Just stick with it for a couple of weeks and you'll wonder how you did without it

At one time in my life I used the sweetener in the little blue packet, then switched to the pink packet, but NOW "they" tell me the yellow packet containing SPLENDA is the healthiest.

Since diabetes runs in my family, I don't want to risk getting that disease or gaining too much weight, so I hope "they" are right in promoting this product.

I've been using it for about a year ... mostly on certain brands of cereal and my hot oatmeal.  It actually enhances the flavor of things I sprinkle it on and actually tastes like it's suppose to: LIKE SUGAR.  And it leaves no artificial aftertaste, which is a big plus with me.  I don't drink coffee and use no sweetener with my hot tea, but it certainly helps to sweeten a big, tall glass of iced-tea on a hot summer day in California.

I recommend this above all sweeteners ... until someone else comes along, proving "they" are wrong.  (This seems to happen every other week in the food industry so how are we consumers supposed to know "for sure" the safest things to consume?

Being an avid tea drinker, I have found Numi Monkey King to be the best green tea.  It's smooth with a hint of sweetness, comforting for the body and mind.

The price is probably the best I have found compared to everywhere else.  Definitely a tea worth stocking up

This Jasmine Green tea is one of the best I've found.  Very smooth and round.  Best to use water that is not boiling hot and not to over steep.
Enjoy...............

*****
Numi Tea's Monkey King Jasmine Green Tea is a premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher. The only ingredient is fair trade certified special grade green tea that is scented with real summer jasmine flowers from China. There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.

On the box, the manufacturer writes: "Jasmine tea is the oldest known scented tea, and ours begins its life in the gardens of Hunan Province. The rich soil and fluctuations in daily temperature yield a fragrant leaf which is further scented with delicate white Jasmine blossoms. During summer, these are gathered daily by the banks of the Min River and repeatedly mated each night with the prepared tea, naturally embracing all of the flowers' scent. When brewed, this smooth, organic green tea has layers of subtle fragrance and hints of moonlight. It is a most romantic tea, and, like a bowl of fresh picked flowers, will bring the joy of summer to your every sip." It sounds quite romantic, and it tastes wonderful. It is a true jasmine tea, and the taste of jasmine predominates, in a both strong and lovely way.

The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love jasmine green tea, this will probably be the best you've ever had.

This is very good.  The secret to cooking it is lots of water-double what
you would use with wheat macaroni.  Bring to boil, then on low aprox 10-15 min.-taste it.  It also freezes well.

I have a three year old and a seven year old and they ask for one of these every day at snack time, and love them.  
I like them very much as well.  The peanut butter ones are a bit better than these... but my son likes the pumpking better.  I'm very excited to have found something healthy that the kids love to eat for a snack.

This is the last of the three (elbows with four cheese, shells with aged wisconsin cheddar) that I tried, and I think it's better than the other two. In all, each variation is excellent, but this white cheddar sauce is excellent and has a very distinct flavor.

My favorite addition to this is mushroom slices (or whole small mushrooms) seared in butter and garlic. After letting them pick up a golden brown in the frying pan, I douse them with vegetable broth, just to get the flavor stuck to the pan off it, and mix all that into the rotini and cheese sauce. Mmmmm

After tasting a bowl of this Mac and Cheese i will never buy Kraft (or any other big corporate) mac and cheese again!
This is delicous and wholesome. The white cheese is creamy and the organic grown noodles taste very fresh. Me and my kids love it and will definitly be ordering more.
Highly recommend

I absolutely love this mac and cheese it is different from any other 'squeeze cheese' style of mac and cheese i've had as the cheese is white. The cheese is soooo good. I highly recomend this pasta. And i really know my macaroni and cheese i consider myself something of a macaroni and cheese conesiur ( i've tried nearly every kind of macaroni and cheese there is and this is by far my favorite. This is excellent and i've turned my friends onto this macaroni. Now when they go to the store they are also buying it. Just give it a try you won't regret it

A Ming Dynasty (AD 1368 - 1644) creation believed to lower cholesterol and promote longevity, jasmine tea consists of Chinese green tea leaves - usually green teas from Fujian province, which is also home to the semi-fermented Oolong and smoky Lapsang Souchong - scented with jasmine flowers. Traditionally, the flowers are harvested during the day and stored in a cool place until nightfall, when they develop their full fragrance. They are then layered over the tea leaves, which have previously been steamed or heated to prevent their oxidation. The tea's quality is determined both by the quality of the green tea used as its base and by the effectiveness of the scenting process. Brewed, it has a delicate, silvery color and a rich fragrance reminiscent of a flower garden in bloom.

Canning and preserving is cheaper than farmer's market produce.  I like having this on hand instead of fruit cocktail for summer ices.  These are too tart to eat as easily as the boysenberries.

The tea included in this is wonderful. Without a picture, I didn't know what it was going to arrive in, what kind of container, and the little box is nothing to brag about, so I wouldn't order it again. I will order the tea again and the bamboo boxes, which I have also received, are a lot nicer than this little box

This is a great snack that my husband and I both love.

I try to keep a variety of snacks at my desk so I always have something healthy on hand, rather than going after the pizza, donuts, etc., that seem to lurk in our office.  For someone eating on the go, these dried fruits are great because they aren't perishable, sticky or messy, come in a super handy little pouch and the crunchy texture is a really nice change compared to most preserved fruits which typically are chewy or gummy

These fruit snacks are the best low calorie, extremely flavorful snacks in the world. I eat the Orchard and Cherry Berry for breakfast at my desk every day. The fruit is dried to a crunch not a gummy chew and the flavor has no aftertaste or funky smell. 

Overall, I love these snacks more than any other pre-packaged food. I carry them with me on trips and eat them at my desk or in my comfy chair at home. Try them!

I am especially pleased with this Rice. I can't imagine how any food item could be more convenient to store or prepare. And, most importantly, it taste quit good. But taste is always very subjective. Another recent reviewer didn't like the taste, and I personally think that it's great. 
  It's also worth mentioning that it was delivered in only 3 days. I placed my order Online on Monday night, and UPS actually delivered it into my hands on Thursday morning. - Highly recommended

The flavor, texture and ease of cooking (60 seconds - WOW!) make this a product that my family uses a lot. Rice, to me, needs to have the right texture and Viva La Rice has it.  It can also be brought to work as it doesn't have to be refrigerated and heated in a microwave

These cookies are superb all by themselves. Far superior to "that other sandwich cookie" in every way. But if you really want to tip the scale into complete decadence, melt some Ghirardelli Double Chocolate Chips in your double boiler, and dip these cookies, then remove to a rack to dry. Your friends will all think you got them at some fancy chocolate store, and beg you for more. Keep out of reach of children

These high-sodium ginger cookies are too tasty to have around - you'll easily surpass your RDA of sodium in one sitting.  

The nutrition facts that Amazon neglected to post are: Serving size is 2 cookies (28 g).  Each serving has 160 mg of sodium, 4.5 mg of fat (2 g saturated, 0 g transfat), 19 g of total carbs (10 g sugars), and 0 g of cholesterol.

The ingredients in these "Made in U.S.A." cookies are organic unbleached wheat flour, powdered sugar, organic palm fruit oil, organic molasses, organic sugar, sodium bicarbonate (leavening), ground ginger, soy lecithin (an emulsifier), salt, monocalcium phosphate (leavening), and nutmeg.  There are no hydrogentated oils or trans fats.

On the back of the package is an Ode to Ginger-O's, which reads: "You might, m'lady tweak my nose. You could, m'lord step on my toes.  But Heaven help those poor bozos, who try to filch my Ginger-O's ".

Again, these high-sodium cookies taste too good in order to effectively exercise self-discipline to limit the quantity eaten.

I do not like store-bought cookies, especially Oreos (too dry and greasy for me). But upon the recommendation of several people, I tried the Ginger O's and was pleasantly surprised. They have excellent flavor and the cream does not have that greasiness to it. If you like ginger cookies, don't hesitate to try these

I love the Original Vanilla Creme Newman's O's, so when I saw the Wheat-Free/Dairy-Free on sale one day I picked one up. I figured it would basically be the same as the Original. The chocolate and vanilla tastes are great, but I found the cookies themselves to be rock hard. So unless you have an issue with wheat or dairy products, I would recommend the Original Vanilla Creme, and not the Wheat-Free/Dairy-Free variety

Basically, these are good granola bars, and the cholesterol-reducing ingredients are a side benefit for some. They're chewy, and the taste is comparable to other Nature Valley bars - good, but nothing amazing. Since the price of these is also comparable to similar Nature Valley bars (package contains 5 bars rather than 6, but they're each slightly bigger) it's a pretty painless way to take a small step against high cholesterol.

The oats, barley and raisins are all good healthy foods, especially for those with high cholesterol. This alone doesn't make them far healthier than many other typical bars. They're special in the addition of plant sterols - from my self-education, I understand them to be plant derivitives that have been shown to lower cholesterol if you eat enough. I don't think they're particularly advised if you don't have unhealthy cholesterol levels, though.

These aren't incredible, but I'm giving them 5 stars since it's hard to find something so convenient with health benefits, still enjoyable and not much more expensive

Try them added to salads or in a baked chicken dish with a little soy sauce and toasted sesame oil. Dried fruit is very different from fresh so don't expect it to taste the same, these are kind of like a natural gummi. Healthy snack. Thanks

i LOVE Hamburger Helper Creamy Stroganoff. it is the most delicious, most satisfying, heavenly treat i've ever tasted. it calls for a pound of ground beef, you can put more or less to taste though. of course it comes out best when you use 7% or better ground beef, two pounds, cause you are gonna have to make two packages! yumm! in my house we eat this three times a week when it's on sale. sometimes i'll be so hungry i'll eat a whole package to myself. i swear it's that good. the only thing is, if you follow the directions is doesn't come out looking like the picture. to make it look like the picture you need to BOIL THE NOODLES FIRST. then mix them with the flavor packets, milk, and cooked burger. by the way, leave at least a cup or more of the water, don't completely strain the noodles.  this will only make it too dry.

I make the crunchy shortbread cookies from the recipe on the bag constantly.  This is a clean tasting sugar but it won't melt in brownies. 

12 packs is a lot but I am nearly half way through this order and have no regrets buying in bulk

I am not an expert on tea, but I have quite a collection, always looking for something good. Having said that, this tea is very good. The flavor is sweet, reminds me of dates, honey and has a very slight malt flavor. I'm drinking some right now actually :) This tea is not bitter at all. There is nothing exotic oe odd tasting about it, a nice everyday tea, like Earl Grey, but it doesn't taste the same.
My father is a doctor and just came back from a medical conference about dieting. He said that Oolong tea is very good to lower your blood sugar and help you lose weight, when you drink it regularly. So, it's more than just a great tasting drink, it's an aid to help you stay healthy

Looking for a late-night snack that's not disgusting for your waistline?  Then be SURE to grab this!  This stuff is fabulous to just munch on in the evenings while watching TV, on the computer, whatever, and it's inexpensive, great for you, and even reduces your cholesterol!  I like mine washed down with a diet Lime Coke, but you might want to try some milk too.  Just give them to the kids sraight out of the box - they just love to eat them too.  Beats potato chips and all the other fattening foods out there plus it's full of vitamins.  And, at 110 calories a serving, that's incredibly hard to beat.  Mix a few nuts and raisins in there too and well, it's just great.  Highly, highly recommend

This sweet treat is, as they say, a lesser evil. It's not health food, in that it's a sweet combination of vanilla and chocolate, but it is much hearlthier than other carmel and chocolate popcorns out there--just check the ingredients. Other reviewers complaining about the nutritional fact panel or the health benefits of this product don't quite get it.

Some reviewers have noted that this is not kettle corn are correct. Others who say this is half caramel corn miss the "black and white" across the front of the bag--it's not caramel, it's vanilla. The chocolate half is delicious--cocoa-laden and therefore perfect when you want something light; not chocolate dipped, which would be overwhelming, heavy, and creamy. The vanilla half is also not dipped, heavy, or overwhelming. It's a lightly sweet plain corn taste to cleanse your palate for more chocolate.

People who love the New England tradition of black and white cabinets (milkshakes, frappes...can't we all just get along?) will adore this popcorn. People trying to avoid nasty chemical ingredients will appreciate this corn. People who love subtle flavors will love this treat. People who think Oreos are really good won't "get" this snack, nor do people who weigh and measure every kernel because they're watching calories. It's a sugary (albeit natural sugar with no hydrogenated oils) snack. It's the lesser of all the evils out there--and makes being nutritionaly bad feel really good

The quality of this good, but the Kettle Corn flavor did not do much for me. I have had other kettle corn and liked it. This was less sweet and more salt than what I prefer. It's not bad, I still manage to choke down the entire bag, but it's not what I was hoping for. Think I may still try the cinnamon though, I hope I like that one better

The chocolate is mild enough not to overwhelm, but strong enough to sate a chocolate-craving. The "kettle corn" part really is just caramel corn, but it's really good, ESPECIALLY considering there is no corn syrup, preservatives, trans fats, artificial flavors, or gluten.  Compared to other "snack" foods, I feel no guilt in eating this

I don't usually buy these kinds of things, but couldn't pass it up when it was on sale a while back. These tasty, healthy treats are perfect for on the go! I snack on them while I am at school. Some fruits have more flavor than others. Raspberries are probably my favorite. Mmmmm my mouth is watering just thinking about them. My only complaint is the price is a little pricey. My girlfriend however doesn't like the tastey treat. May not be for everyone. Taste testing them somewhere could be advised, although I am not sure where you could test them out

Since its a whole cashew and chocolate, no artificial anything, it is a nice snack treat.

Looking at Amazons price , its cheaper per bag than if I bought them in the store, and no tax, a good deal

First time trying this and it's delicious! It's super soft and chewy and tastes great. It's almost as good as a rice crispy treat, but it's better for you healthwise. And to top it off, it's organic! 

One reviewer asked, why add coconut? It's hard to imagine apricot and nut and coconut, but I love it. It's not a strong artificial coconut flavor. It's real, organic coconut. It's subtle and adds a nice smell and taste.

I will add a closeup of the nutrition facts in the "customer images" link above, right underneath the main image. Make your own educated purchase.

I haven't tried the other flavors, but this one's so good, I'll have to try a different flavor next. These are great as breakfast bars

I am deployed to Iraq, so I needed some healthy snacks I could take with me, that were semi-perishable.  I ordered these bars and couldn't be happier!  They are soft, chewy and taste great!  The fact that they are organic and made from whole grains and other wholesome ingredients is a big plus.  These are a good substitute for a dessert, especially when you are craving something sweet and chewy.  The only negitive for me was that Amazon will not ship to APO addresses, so I had to ship these to my parents first, for them to ship them to me.

These are fantastic.  Not dry or bland like some granola bars.  They're very chewy (kind of like Rice Krispy Treats!!) with lots of flavor.  I have these for a mid-day snack.  My 3 and 4 yr old love them too.  I also have tried the peanut butter version and found them to be equally as good.  I had been buying these bars at our local health food store.  Not only was I paying more money than Amazon sells them for, but they were not as fresh as the bars I got from Amazon

I really like this green tea. I find it to be much better than the other brand. I add a little lemon and splenda to mine and enjoy it hot or cold. 
 
What I wonder is if it is 6/40 count boxes like the title reads or 6/20 count boxes which is in the description??? Hmmm.....If it is 40 counters then this is a great deal.

If you love ginger or any of the other Destrooper cookies, you will like these.  They are light and crispy, not at all like a chewy ginger snap. Not too strongly spiced and with small bits of delicious candied ginger. Very good.

As a "Cubicle Commando" Pringles often find their way into my bottom left drawer.  They are a staple food in this environment.  I suspect Dibert would derive almost 30% of his nutrients from these!

I love pringles!

However, I've come to the conclusion that I need to buy them in the traditional tube because whenever I buy them in the "convenient" snak pack, I'm lucky to get half of them that aren't broken or crumbled.  What's the point of Pringles if you can't eat then whole?

Packaging makes a difference.  Maybe you'll have better luck than me, but that is my take on it

This is the most wonderful tea for fighting off and shortening the duration of colds and coughs.  I usually prepare it with lemon and honey, and it's a very soothing blend with hints of mint and eucalyptas.  The echinacea and zinc combined help me fight off the nasty little bugs that seem to float around the office.  As soon as I get a sore throat, I head straight for this wonderful tea

My children love Pop Tarts but I just can't bring myself to let them start their day drowning in sugar and sometimes sprinkles and icing. I bought these pastries and handed them out, half expecting groans of displeasure from all three children as I had when trying to sneak in turkey bacon and sugar free syrup. But my children love these. I tasted one and they are quite sweet and the blueberry filling actually tastes like blueberries! I cannot stand the taste of a Pop Tart but these actually have a pleasant flavor from pastry and filling

This is probably one of the best granolas I've tasted.  What I like most about it is the texture.  Too many granolas just about break your teeth when you eat them - but this one has a firm (ie. not mushy) but pliable texture.  The next thing I enjoyed about this cereal is the taste - not too sweet nor too bland - just a perfect balance.  Too often sweetened cereals are much too sweet - or, on the flip side, the "healthy" cereals are too bland.  Finally - this cereal is just plain healthy!!  What a great combo - Flax and Pumkin seeds!!  We ate up this cereal in record time and are ordering more today!

Having read there was no need to buffer the chocolate with oil, I was sold almost instantly.  After reading the reviews, I had to have it.  My husband and I used this in our Rival chocolate fountain for our wedding and the results were divine.  Guests couldn't get enough of it, and I was having so much fun, I didn't even mind when I accidentally wiped melted chocolate on my gown!  (I simply turned to my photographer and asked, "You can edit that out of the photos.  Right?")
We used the dark chocolate and we have no complaints whatsoever. We actually purchased quite a lot of it prior to the wedding as we weren't sure how much we would need.  We had enough left over for our Christmas party here at the house and we were thrilled with the results!  
Another note:  I have a dear friend who is highly allergic to tree nuts and was afraid to use this chocolate at a post-wedding party she and her husband hosted for my husband and me.  I called SF Chocolate before our Christmas party and actually spoke with a very kind lady who immediately went to check on this for me.  When she got back to the phone, she said, "I just spoke with the lady who processes the chocolate and she said she doesn't process it on any shared equipment."  She checked with the lady who processes the chocolate?  WAHOO!  How often does THAT happen?  Come to think of it, how often does a gal get to talk with a living, breathing person when she calls the manufacturer of ANYTHING?
Oh!  How does it taste?  We got the Dark Chocolate and loved it!  The flavor is wonderful and the consistency is smooth as silk.  The chocolate fountain is a bit of a pain to set up and tear down, but it's worth it for the reaction of the guests and the exquisite flavor of the chocolate itself.  
Just say no to regular chocolate chips and oil

I usually buy Nonni's at the supermarket when it is on sale and I have a coupon because they are an expensive luxury. This is a great price, especially if you can take advantage of the $10 off $49 in the grocery department offer.  They are great with coffee or hot cocoa

This licorice was the best sugar free I have ever had. Loving licorice and being diabetic was terrible. Now that I have discovered Gustaf's, it isn't so bad anymore

Learning to bake without gluten is a new process for me. I thought that working with the dough seemed more like making a cookie dough than rolling out a pie crust. Without gluten it lacks the elasticity that I am used to. Once I got the knack of working with the dough and doing some patching I was very pleased with the results. The flavor and appearance of the pie were not distinguishable from a crust made with wheat flour. In fact, the crust was flaky and even better than many pie crusts that I have eaten.

I have tried every GoldenValleyNatural.com Jerky product.  By far the best are all the Sweet N'Spicy and Peppered Flavors.  Beef tends to be smoky and fatty, while Turkey is dry and flaky, making their Buffalo meat varieties the best of them all.
Avoid their Low Carb Jerky unless you are willing to bite off tic-tac size bites and chew for a minute each time.  All the Teriyaki Jerkys have the texture and taste like sweet Corned Beef, so I'd skip them as well.
If you want to try different flavors, instead of 8 of the same from Amazon, just go directly to their web sight and buy them for only 15% more than Amazon's sale price
