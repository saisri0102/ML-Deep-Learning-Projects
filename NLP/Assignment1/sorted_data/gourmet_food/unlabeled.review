Oh my gosh - I am so happy Amazon has green tea Pocky! It's awfully hard to find, even in New York City. It used to have some trans fat, though - they might have taken it out with their Healthy Pocky Initiative (or whatever it's called), but it's something to watch out for. Otherwise, this stuff is really fantastically good and any fan of Pocky will love this smooth creamy green tea happiness!

The taste is really great it is a bitter chocolate and tastes like one that is expensive high end to me.  Mens is the name perhaps because the 2 individual packs are so big.  When I first saw that I wondered if this was a musk candy like they have in australia.  Nope these are for everyone.  It is an easy way to have an easy dose of chocolate.  I cannot eat a whole pack just one stick at a time.  Share this with some friends.  Would be fun to have these for a party

WOW! What else can I say. This is some amazing tasting marshmallow. I made fluffer nutter sandwiches for the first time in almost 10 years! I never thought I would be able to do that again! I don't know what amazed me more, the incredible taste and marshmallow made without sugar and other artificial flavors or the fact that when I called to find out if I could buy it local I was informed that it was only available direct from this company and that they would be making fresh marshmallow the next day if I wanted to order more.....you mean it doesnt spend 6 months in a warehouse and a couple of months on a supermarket shelf? WOW! This really is the best thing since sliced bread, at least in my book it is. I was also told it works well to make rice crispy treats, I'll try that with my next tub! I'm so excited about finding this little treat

These noodles are traditional for sukiyaki but work well as oriental noodles or even chicken soup noodles. And made of tofu, they won't add carbs to your diet. I find I cannot eat processed starch--upsets my stomach, so these are a total lifesaver. And the slightly slippery soft texture is soothing. Love'em

I bought this over 6 months ago from an Asian food store. It is so good! It's really cool how the rice paper melts in your mouth. I gave some to my little cousins and they loved it. It's a wonderful thing to suck on and it's not very sticky either. It also comes with a sticker or a tatoo.

I don't even like tea, but these candies are delicious. On first taste, they're a little bitter and weird tasting as you absorb the green tea powder coating. As you continue eating the candy, it develops into a chewy tasty gummy type candy. Very tasty and definitely grows on you! One warning, they're not a healthy snack, so watch out how many the you and the kids eat

this is my first asian food purchase with pier mall, and my first review here at amazon as well... these matcha candies get better and better with each one- i can see how they could become quite addictive! individually wrapped and matcha powder coated, this flavor takes some getting used... the outside is kind of hard underneath the powder, and then the inside is all chewy and decadent- YUMMY - actually, i think i'm already addicted!! also, nice to travel with or put in your bag- these won't melt or make a mess.

Japanese snacks and sweets are my favorite! And this is the top of the top.... There is just something about Pocky. The very crisp cookie that is not too sweet and the coating that ...well...is quite sweet. This is one of my favorites - It's very yummy. In the United States there is so much emphasis on low fat low carb blah blah blah...on and on ...i think we forget what tastes good and satisfying. These are both good and satisfying. 

Try them. Pocky are popular world wide for good reason!

First of all, I do agree with the above reviewers who thought this wasn't a great fruit dip. Second, there's very little marshmallow flavor-this stuff is NOTHING like regular marshmallow fluff. 

However, I still give this 5 stars, because it's got features you can't get anywhere else. The texture is smooth pudding (Grainy reviewer perhaps ate his past the expiration date?) and that's mainly how I use this. Because of the slightly sharp taste of the cellulose, this dip lends itself very well to making citrus puddings (just add about 1/4 cup lemon concentrate and stir, doesn't get any easier than that). I also use it to make cheesecake and other dessert recipes. 

To actually make a good fruit dip out of this, try mixing it with yogurt or cream cheese

And, I don't have to worry about ingesting the great unknown yellow #5 or red #2.  Go Yummy Earth!  I can't wait to see what these guys come out with next

This is a very good product. It keeps you from having to try to mix your own cinnamon and sweetener. It's good for a lot of things for those who can't have sugar. My favorite is cinnamon toast. I will reorder it when I am out of it. It's so nice to have something with Splenda instead of aspartame

 Having begged a local super market WEGMANS in Buffalo NY suburbs,I found this product in the refrigerated isle w/yogurt and procesed and packaged ready to eat heat and serve items.
 Texture was not exactley what I expected,but knowing that being a type II diabetic put regular spagetti out of reach (too high in carbs.)I ate the treat with my favorite sauce,then proceeded to put on my shoes and drive directley to the supermarket to purchase another pound of SHIRATAKI Spagetti for my next planned sauce meal.
 This product is great for me because I eat alone several times a week , it is easy to prepare and is satisfying .
 I do have a problem with the high cost $1.99 per pound,but I will use this product again just not as often as I would like.

The KEY is in preparation!  I was lucky enough to read this on HG's website.  You have to rinse it REALLY, REALLY well in strainer.  Then pat it dry.  Completely dry.  Then i add whatever sauce and microwave for less than a minute.  Ive had it 2 days in a row and im ordering more now!  My first order came within one day! Go noodles

I know my gummi's and Haribo gummi's are the only ones worth eating! If I can't find this brand at the store, it's nothing. A little tip: I buy the 5lb. bag at Safeway for under $6! (A much better bargain than here.) They are usually located on the bottom shelf underneath the hanging smaller bags

I followed the package instructions and these noodles turned out great!  They do have a different texture than carb noodles.  They are firmer, and more slick.  But these noodles taste great!  They are more than worth the $2 in order to cut the carbs!  I ate them with margarine and garlic salt and I loved them more than regular carb noodles.  Luckily, a local grocery store started selling them, so I no longer have to pay the outrageous shipping price (they are refrigerated)

I just tried these noodles after reading article in first magazine for women. Thought they were great and I only used organic chicken broth with carrots. I am very satisfied with the taste and ask everyone...what are you expecting for a pasta substitute????!!!!Just don't be so picky and be grateful there's something to eat thats healthy low carb and low calorie and can be doctored up with all kinds of foods and ideas. Happy snackin

I lived in Japan for many years & really enjoyed using these "noodles" in soups, stir-fry, Korean-style cooking, etc.  If you are looking for pasta, these may not exactly match your craving, but are nonetheless really versatile!  My advice for those who don't like the smell upon opening the package is to drain them, sprinkle liberally with salt & rub through with clean hands, then rinse in cold water.  This is how they prepare them in Japan - it removes any odor & they are ready to use

I started eating these as a kid and I still love them.  I am not Asain, but I like foods from all over the world.  These candies have a little rice paper edible wrapper.  While the toys moved to stickers now the candy is still really good.  It has a unique flavor and I just cannot get enough of these.  They are pretty wholesome for candy.  They really are a special treat.  I think they are healthier than other candies.  I am not sure what American kids of today would think, but if they are not used to total junk I think they would like them.  These are really special.  The taste is really light.  They are chewy and sticky so you would not want to give them to really little kids for risk of choaking.  I do think they would be healthier than other things and might be nice for a holiday special gift or other special occasion for an older child.  Someone who is age 5 and up would be perfect

I've been snacking on Botan Rice Candy since I was a little girl.  My mom used to pick it up for us every time she visited the Asian grocery store.  And I still have it a few times a year.  This candy is delicious!  Sweet like honey, but not too sweet...chewy like caramel squares, but not sticky.  And the sticker is sometimes a tattoo- bonus!  It's fun

Oh my gosh - I am so happy Amazon has green tea Pocky! It's awfully hard to find, even in New York City. It used to have some trans fat, though - they might have taken it out with their Healthy Pocky Initiative (or whatever it's called), but it's something to watch out for. Otherwise, this stuff is really fantastically good and any fan of Pocky will love this smooth creamy green tea happiness!

If I could survive on Pocky and pocky alone, I would do it. This is the world's perfect snack food. Strawberry is the best of them all, though I am partial to the coconut and chocolate flavors too. Sweet creamy strawberry-y goodness coats a thin crispy cracker stick, making for a one-of-a-kind taste sensation in your mouth. Plus one tip is uncoated, so you don't even have to get your hands dirty. If you only try one Japanese food, this is the one. Try it, you won't be disappointed

The service from iGourmet is impeccable

Everything arrived in perfect condition i.e. ripe (and therefore "stinky" just like it should be!!)

The Styrofoam packaging was the perfect vessel for delivery; the cheese arrived "alive" from not being over chilled.

I have not had cheese of this quality outside France, and this is the first time I have found "perfect" cheese in the US.

If you like top quality "stinky" cheese this is for you........

Japanese snacks and sweets are my favorite! And this is the top of the top.... There is just something about Pocky. The very crisp cookie that is not too sweet and the coating that ...well...is quite sweet. This is one of my favorites - It's very yummy. In the United States there is so much emphasis on low fat low carb blah blah blah...on and on ...i think we forget what tastes good and satisfying. These are both good and satisfying. 

Try them. Pocky are popular world wide for good reason!

I followed the instructions and was pleasantly suprised by the taste and unique (unique = good) texture.  These noodles weren't like pasta, but they were good.  I'll have no problem eating them agian.  As a matter of fact I thought they were quite delicious

If you're expecting egg pasta made from the finest durum wheat, you'll be disappointed, but if you're a fan of japanese sukiyaki, stir-fry udon and chow fun these low carb subs will be right up your alley.  Also and excellent sub for pad thai dishes.  If the texture doesn't bother you, then go ahead and try it with your favorite western-style dishes.  

Shirataki (shredded konjac) really has no flavor itself, but like tofu, it absorbs flavors extremely well.  In addition to being low in calories and carbs, it's very good for your digestive system!  Eat up

I read about this product on the Hungry Girl website.  It listed Amazon as a supplier.  I read all the reviews and decided to place an order.  It took longer than I expected to arrive, since I had to pay extra shipping I thought it would be here sooner.  The extra shipping must have been  for the cool pack in the box it was shipped in.

The noodles were a little chewier than regular pasta.  But like regular pasta the didn't really have a taste of their own and took on the taste of what ever sauce you use.  I really did like them.  Being diabetic, it is a great pasta alternative that will not raise my blood sugar.  And I didn't find a unpleasant smell when I opened the bag as another reviewer wrote. Just the same I did rinse them well.

I have since found them in a local health food store so I won't have to pay the high shipping any more.  I have not been able to find the spaghetti type anywhere, only the flat noodle type and I would really like to try the spaghetti.  

I would recommend this product to any one that wants a lower carb, lower calorie pasta

I lost 90 lbs and have not had pasta in over 10 years!  I found this product on hungry-girl, ordered it and now have had chicken fettucine alfredo and spaghetti and sauce for the first time in years!!
The KEY is in preparation!  I was lucky enough to read this on HG's website.  You have to rinse it REALLY, REALLY well in strainer.  Then pat it dry.  Completely dry.  Then i add whatever sauce and microwave for less than a minute.  Ive had it 2 days in a row and im ordering more now!  My first order came within one day! Go noodles

I was expecting a good thing after all the positive reviews.  It was even better than I'd hoped.  The first container was entirely devoted to fluffer nutters.  I had to fight my boyfriend for the second container and he could eat the real stuff if he wanted!

Once I was down to just a little fluff stuck to the sides of the container, I used strawberries (alright, and the occasional finger) to scrape the last of it out.

A great product is one thing, but this company has great customer service, too.  I called the store because I had a question about another one of their products.  They were extraordinarily helpful and friendly.  Even though they were very busy, I wasn't rushed off the phone.  They treated me like my business mattered a great deal to them.  This is a rare thing to find in today's corporate landscape where the customer is treated like the most unimportant cog in the machine

I have to say, growing up my marshmallow Cream always came out of a jar, so half way through the jar you'd have to put your hand inside and get it all sticky.  Now with this tub with a wide mouth, my hands aren't sticky.  PLUS because it has no carbs or sugar, I can eat more straight then I ever could... without having to worry as much either

I just got my first tin today -- and I say &quot;first,&quot; because I know there will be many,  many more in my future! These cheese straws are just divine -- delicious, savory, great texture. You really feel like you're eating a batch of &quot;fully loaded&quot; premium cheese straws. Having started on the Atkins plan, I've been looking high and low for something that actually tastes good that satisfies that craving for a &quot;munchie.&quot; This has been a super find! (My other super find, also available on Amazon, is Ross chocolates...super-low-carb and amazingly delicious.) And I'm still trying to pick my jaw up from off the floor at the idea of these things being absolutely NO carb

I have loved MarketSpice Tea since I first purchased it while on vacation at Pike Place Market in Seattle some years ago.  Because I live in the midwest, I was happy to see that MarketSpice tea can now be purchased at Amazon.com.  If you like a great, hearty tea, full of character, I recommend you try MarketSpice.  One whiff while it is brewing will convince you that here is an exceptional tea. Once you have tasted MarketSpice it will be hard to settle for any tea that doesn't have the great taste of MarketSpice.

Leonidas' Chocolates makes an especially sweet treat for Christmas and these do remind me a bit of white chocolate snowballs. The dark chocolate champagne ganache is a sweet surprise and if at room temperature, can be very creamy or like a liquid chocolate center. These chocolates are very sweet and will satisfy the most intense sugar craving.

Highly recommend, especially if you like beans. This soup is delicious and can be made quickly. You can enjoy it as is, or you can add fresh or frozen vegetables. I made it both ways. I added 1/2 cup fresh sliced carrots and 1/4 cup celery at start. Alone it makes a thick soup. All my family really liked this soup. Plan to try all Nueva Cocina soups

I decided to try these to see if I would get the same boost as I get from chocolate, but with fewer calories. I have been eating them straight from the bag, and I enjoy them that way. The taste is bitter, but not terribly so, and they have a slightly fermented taste that I like. The texture is pleasantly crunchy, much like roasted almonds. I'm not sure I would call these a low-calorie snack: one ounce is 160 calories, 100 of which are from fat. However, I only eat about a tablespoon at a time, a few times a day, and that is a lot less than one ounce. As for the boost, well, I'm not sure. If there's an effect, it's subtle

C. Howard Company has been around since 1934, when Mr. Howard formed it in New York City to sell his violet mints. Actually, due to the way he wrote his signs, it has been "Choward Violet Mints" ever since then! So successful were these mints, that they were soon followed by "Violet Scented Gum."

This gum is very hard to describe. It has a wonderful, perfumed scent that makes you think that it will taste like some sort of chemical, but nothing can be further from the truth. This gum has a delicate taste that clears the mouth and freshens the breath.

When I was young, a local drug store carried a wide range of candies, including Violet Mints and Violet Gum. Whenever I could I would go and buy a pack, and to this day the taste of these candies takes me back to my youth and that drug store with the giant racks of candy.

So, if you want a gum that tastes like NOTHING you've ever had before, one that freshens your breath and excites your palette, then buy this gum. It's fantastic

Tazo Chai Organic Spiced Black Tea is a blend of black tea, ginger, cinnamon, black pepper, cardamom, cloves and star anise. These items are all organically grown and this creates a sense of purity and clarity of thought.

The tea has a delicious rich flavor and is perfectly blended for an ultimate Chai experience. Delicious when you add a packet of Stevia and a swirling of orange blossom honey. Milk powder makes this richer and a dash of cream makes it luxurious.

While drinking this tea you are transported to India where Chai wallahs sooth your soul with a cup of spicy tea. Each cup of Tazo tea is an adventure and this tea is especially delicious.

I had to give up coffee completely last year and turned to tea, instead.  I've tried 70+ varieties of tea in the past year.  Some the many brands I've tried include Tazo, Stash, Adagio, Republic of Tea, Twinings, Harrogate's, and Market Spice. Tea sampling has become a fun little hobby for me.

After reading a tea gourmand's review stating that she tried numerous high-end bagged teas -- Barry's, Yorkshire Gold, PG Tips, and the like -- only to find she kept coming back to Tazo's Awake, I decided to give "Awake" a try.  I fell in love at first sip.   I have 3 large mahoghany tea chests filled with various tea bags, but this is the tea I drink everyday.  I enjoy a cup of "Awake" each morning, with a dab of milk.  It's my new religion.  

This tea is not for everyone. My husband acted disdainful toward "Awake" when he tasted it, saying it kinda reminded him of everyday Liptons tea. (Interestingly, I later read a survey saying that a bunch of blind-folded gourmands tasted something like 20 cups of various teas, only to unaminously choose -- LIPTON'S!!! The magazine said that all the taste-testers were shocked when they learned that they choose Liptons over the gourmet tea blends! hahaha)

I don't know why I find this tea so addictive.  Perhaps it's strong, rich flavor that appeals to the coffee drinker in me?  Regardless of the reason, I highly recommend you give this tea a try if you like assertively-flavored teas.

"There are few hours in life more agreeable than the hour dedicated to the ceremony known as afternoon tea." -Henry James, Portrait of a Lady
This "English Breakfast" style tea is quite satisfying and has a rich flavor that is quite delicious. 

I'd like to say that their teas are best steeped for an extra 5-10 minutes to draw out all the delicious flavors. I use my coffee maker to make tea. Simply put the loose tea in a coffee filter or the tea bags in the coffee pot, then allow the boiling water to drip over the tea leaves.

The sensual blend of exotic spices, teas and herbs used in the TAZO teas include a mixture of the following: Black tea, green tea, hibiscus flowers, chamomile flowers, lemongrass, spearmint leaves, blackberry leaves, cinnamon, Rooibos, Gingerroot, rose hips, orange peel, rose petals, licorice root, safflowers, black pepper, lemon verbena leaves, cardamom, cloves, peppermint leaves, chicory, sarsaparilla root, lemon balm leaf, star anise and red poppy flowers.

This is a blend of black teas, but all their teas are worth trying. If you are looking for a rich black tea, then this should impress you.

First of all, I must start with the fact that Funny Bones have a lower melting point than Helium. You breath near them and they basically start to liquify. Anyway, onto the review...

Drake's Funny Bones consistantly deliver a product that I am very happy to put in my mouth. The peanut butter-chocolate combination is executed with style and dignity, and this snack is fabulous. The end

I have tried pretty much every brand of single serve coffe pods out there and I have found Black Mountain Gold to be the richest and most flavorable. I highly recommend everyone to try this brand.

Besides being sweet, does sugar -- from sugar cane -- have a flavor?  It does!  And when the sugar boils down into syrup, the flavor comes out.  So, okay -- it IS sugar.  Politically incorrect.  Empty calories.... I know, I know.  But whether you take your sugar "naturally" in fruit or honey or "unnaturally" in hiprocessed candies and sugar-coated cereals, the chemical is the same....And the thing is not to get too much. And if I'm going to have a certain amount ANYway, there are days when this is how I want to eat it.  Ly'les Golden Syrup is  a nice flavor alternative to honey, or maple syrup.  The texture is thick like honey, but the flavor is light.  It has much more "depth" and thickness than corn syrup.   If you like crisp, Belgian waffles, this is great on them --with or without pats of melted butter.  My grandma used to use this more than 50 years ago and I started loving it as a kid.  She put it in frostings and who knows what else.  But I just like it as it is... dip your fingers in and lick them off.  Ummmmmmmm....  So why can't you get this stuff in your local supermarket?  I can't find it anywhere.... It's because most people don't know about it.  And don't know to ask for it, or how or where to get it.  I've never seen an ad for this, and it isn't manufactured by one of the megafoodgiant monopolies in the U.S. , but it is worth having.  I just wish I didn't have to order it in sufficient quantities to justify the shipping charge.  Kind of silly to pay $7 to have a $4 item shipped.  So then you buy several... but who has room to store several?     And it takes a long time to go through one can of it.  LIke, a year.  So, if I get three cans, I have enough for three years.  Still, it's worth the shipping to get two cans...I want some right now. Too bad I have to wait

This is used in my two-year-old Dacor microwave and it provides fluffy popcorn.  I tried an air popper and that was an exercise in frustration.

My experience was just the opposite with this company in terms of delivery and service. I didn't order until a week before Christmas...everything arrived perfect, on time, and my best friend's mother LOVED it.

When I finally arrived in town, I was able to sample some of it and it was tasty. The cups were much bigger and nicer than I expected and the basket definitely delivered in terms of quality.

I can definitely believe they had issues with FedEx however because my friend ordered from another company that same week, and it was flowers that didn't get to my mother and grandmother until a week after Christmas due to shipping issues

I believe that this brand is the best brand of gummi available. Not too sticky on your teeth, not sickeningly sweet, even the green ones are yummy. Not to mention plenty of red ones in the bag.  Gummi officianados know what I'm talking about. If they get the green ones right the rest are ok too. I have actually been able to get these in my local Walgreens store, so thankfully I won't ever have to go without again.

I decided to take a chance and give this product a try.  As it turned out, my wife and I were both surprised by the excellent flavor of these different than the norm gummy bears.  Unlike many of this type of product that have just missed the pure sugar taste, these have a good not too sweet not to sour flavor.

The popcorn itself is yummy, just be warned that we had trouble popping it using our air popper.  The kernels were too light and would blow out of the popper before they were popped.  It's great in the microwave or a pan, but maybe the larger white or yellow would be a better match for an air popper

I was a little concerned to buy the popcorn, as you never know what you are going to get.  But I did and I am glad I did.  The popcorn is nice and tender, pops easy, great taste and hull-less.  I have moved from the microwave popcorns and glad I did because of this product.  I like the fact the the popped corn is small but great!

Dreamfield's is the only American made pasta--low carb or otherwise--that tastes like fine Italian pasta. It cooks al dente and stays that way, even when eaten the next day as leftovers. And the taste is perfect! My husband and I were just diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, and purchased Dreamfield's pasta as part of our low carb diet. It's fantastic! Hope they add more shapes and sizes.

I am pretty fussy about my steaks and even meat in general.  Accept for eating an occasional filet mignon or sometimes pork I don't eat much meat.  However, when I do I want something REALLY good and these steaks fit the bill at a tremendous price.  Delivery is convenient, they are vacuum packed and come with excellent cooking instructions.  I have give these to friends and business associates as a gift and they appreciate them tremendously.  Not one person has ever been disappointed.

If you purchase from this company, they will email you occasional advertising material.  However, they were courteous on the phone with phone orders and didn't push too hard.  At least that has been my experience with the one time I called in a phone order.  If you do business with them regularly, you will get special offers that are even a better deal

I once tried to reverse engineer grapes by soaking raisins in water for 6 months.   For my crime against Nature, I was punished with the hideous form that drove me to lurk about the sewers, ostracized from normal life by my gruesome visage and freakish, mutant powers.  Now, I fight the kind of crime that the police won't deal with and get only fleeting moments of humanity whenever someone I save forgets about my grotesque appearance and shows me tender kindness that I used to know when I looked like a man.


Don't make the mistake I did and think that you can play God with grapes.  Just order the REAL thing from here and spare yourself the curse of the mutant anti-hero

The mighty Solanum lycopersicum is one of the most versatile fruits.  It is tasty in all forms, except the juice.  Whether it's sauce, puree, in the raw, or even ketchup, you can't go wrong with the incredible edible tomato.  I seem to have a tomato or tomato-based food or sauce every single day.  It's healthy too as it contains Lycopene, one of nature's most powerful anti-oxidants....great for the prostate!

As a side note, tomato put the "T" in BLT

A rich, influential tea with strong hint of the deeper, transcendental realities that might brew in the hidden golden teapots of Shangri-lah. In that lonelye wintrey nighte when you feel all cosey and tighte, this tea shall take you there.  
Listen to the "Out of Africa" soundtrack whilst you sippest  -it fits damn well. It also goes well with your nightly flying lessons that you might consider taking with the ace named Antoine de Saint-Exupry.
Endless possibilites, in one word. Or two.

This tea scores high on all counts--fragrance, flavor and even the name!!  Making tea with Lotus creates a delicate light green brew which is deliciously scented.  The flavor is augmented by the aroma--a light floral flavor with just a hint of the grassines of green tea.  The flavor of lotus flower is hard to describe--it has a slight buttery flavor reminiscent of fine jasmine tea.

If you need a strong jolt of flavor this tea is not for you.  If you want something unusual, savor the subtlety of this wonderful tea.

How many weekends have I spent, in the loincloth, knife clenched in my teeth, running through the fields trying to find a rabbit? (A bunch, trust me on this, a bunch.) All so I can have something to sacrifice on the altar once I get to the cave. 

Now, with this, home, fix a cocktail, go through the day's mail, finish my drink and drive over to the cave, yank this carcass out of the box and offer this at the feet of my dark lord and master, boom, done. I'm happy, my dark lord and master is happy, everybody wins. 

What a time saver.

What is undervalued in the sale pitch of this item (and it's overall sense of delight while you sun-bathe on the car-port covered in at least six of these freshly delivered delights) is the wonderful "SPAK" sound it makes when you throw it to the linoleum

Twinkies rank high on my list of pure junk foods.  The sugar and corn syrup in Twinkies help push the calorie count to around 150.  I do not care to think about what kind of fats and carbs go in to the 150 calories.

On the other hand, I grew up with Twinkies.  I used to eat them as fast as I could get my hands on them.  Unfortunately, I am unable to do that any more.  You get older, you get smarter, I guess.  But I still like an occasional Twinkie.  Yes, they are sweet.  Yes, they have too many calories.  But, they taste good!  I wish they still offered banana creme Twinkies.

More recently people have actually enhanced the calories in a Twinkie by deep frying them.  Cooking a Twinkie should be something you do only with great care.  There is a process to successfully making a deep fried Twinkie, and there are many processes that do not work.  To the best of my knowledge all of the processes yield even more calories, but even better flavor.  You get the general idea.  The better Twinkies taste, the more calories they have.  Go figure.

Twinkies in their current form will never be mistaken for a health food.  But I will probably continue to indulge in one periodically for as long as I can.

Enjoy!

When you have to impress the in-laws or that new girlfriend... or actually whenever you just want the perfect burger!!  These babies are preformed, shrink wrapped, and are perfect for the grill.  I have yet to have one be less than perfect.  The difference between these burgers and the ones from Krogers are immense!  I usually grill mine outside, but even when we put them on the fry pan, they come out fantastic.  I can not recommend these burgers highly enough.

I usually wait until Omaha offers a really good steak deal with free burgers thrown in and then make my order in bulk. Always arrives when they say it will and never fails to please.  One aside... the "extras" like knives and cutting boards are throw-aways... wait til there are good meat sales!!!  Also... try the beef tips... They are to die for!!

Enjoy,

Ja

I recently received a shipment of Omaha burgers.  I normally order the filets.  The burgers were perfect size for a hamburger bun, they are pre-formed and uniformly sized -- that way they're all done cooking at the same time.  The ground beef was high quality and didn't shrink at all and the burgers had full flavor.

They are a little pricey for burgers, but I will order them again for their quality.  They're perfect when having a small group of friends over for a cookout

I can't say enough good things about JR Mushrooms. These are top-quality chef inspired vanilla beans. I got them primaraily for my creme brulee.

Another plus was the free shipping which really helps a struggling young chef like myself. The only slight dissappointment was that there was no "Best Creme Brulee" recipe enclosed. No problem for me as I've memorized the procedure.

I can say this: You won't be dissappointed by this product. Use it in whatever calls for vanilla, even ice cream

****
Tazo's Calm Herbal Infusion is a nice chamomile tea. I taste the chamomile and some flavorings, and they are not unpleasant, just hard to pin down as to what they are besides the chamomile. In general I'm not a big fan of tea with flavorings added, preferring the subtleness and authentic taste of the real thing.

The ingredients in Calm are: chamomile flowers, hibiscus flowers, spearmint, lemongrass, rose petals, blackberry leaves, safflowers, peppermint, sarsaparilla, lemon balm, licorice and natural flavors. It is caffeine-free!

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.

On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a soothing blend of chamomile blossoms and other relaxing herbs." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Calm as "creamy, floral, minty, toasty, sweet, honey-like. As the name gently implies, Tazo Calm has a lovely floral bouquet with an apple-like flavor and distinct toasty notes.  Naturally sweet in a nice light way, with a smooth finish". Tazo describes the aroma as "minty, hay like, rose". I don't taste all of these various flavors, but I do taste the chamomile, and it is fine, not overwhelming or as artificial tasting as several of the other Tazo teas I've sampled.

I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Calm gets only four stars.

Iceberg Lettuce, the queen of the salad,
Hardly any taste and its looks rather palid,
Can't use it as a wrap or as an ice scraper,
It's way to fragile to use as toilet paper.

Can't use lettuce to roll up a fatty-
But lettuce really rules on a hamburger patty,
The Mexicans pick it, which shouldn't be a shocker-
I understand they also use lettuce to play soccer

This is the one coffee that I have recommended over and over again and it is my all time favorite Starbucks blend.
Earthy full bodied bold flavor that goes well with everything from waking up in the morning to an after dinner coffee to enjoy with friends.
I have traveled over an hour to find this blend before when Starbucks only made it available seasonally. I was thrilled when they started offering it year-round.
It is best in whole bean is well worth the price

"Throughout India, chai wallahs can be found serving cups of decaffeinated chai to souls who naturally seek inner beauty at a slightly gentler pace." 

If you like your Chai with a peppery kick, then this tea will interest you. Rooibos, cinnamon, ginger, decaffeinated black tea, cardamom, ginger, chicory, cloves, star anise and other natural flavors seem to take a back seat to the delicious peppery flavor of this tea. This tea tastes similar to a tea I first tasted in Africa, where Rooibos tea is grown. 

Best served with milk/powdered milk/soy milk or a dash of cream and some honey. Since this is a decaffeinated tea, it is perfect for late night writing sessions or when you want something calming to drink that doesn't taste like chamomile. 

I recently discovered Tazo Teas and have been immersing myself in the mysterious experience with a sense of abandon. 

Caffeine Free tea with exotic spices.

If your trying to do a low carb product.  This works out great.  There are receipies on tova's website on how to make poundcake, pancakes, and a variety of other items.  They turn out pretty great.

Try it.  It's a great product.

Mmm... this stuff is great!  I got some this year right before Thanksgiving and it surprised me!  Cranberry Fool is great with SO many things - I love it on crackers and with cheese and bread, but some people I know love it on ice cream as well.  I haven't used it much in cooking or baking, but the times I have it has gotten rave reviews!  It's GREAT as a glaze!  If you like cranberries, try this - you won't regret it

Cranberry Fool did just that; fooled me! I was expecting the usual dull Thanksgiving side dish that never stands alone. This is much more. I have glazed it on ham, baked it on turkey, and best of all it is a wonderful appetizer with cheese. First,the usual way served on gourmet crackers. It is especially delightful toasted in the oven with a variety of cheeses on thin cut bread. The palate is sharpened, allowing a lighter but more satisfying meal for the calorie and carb conscious. It also serves wonderfully as a light but substantial snack with no sugar. Cranberry Fool is simply an all purpose delight

I was in heaven when I sliced my first loaf. Smotherd butter on my first slice and realized I can have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  Actually its healthier than wonder bread. This was definately worth the investment. I purchased the bread maker that has a gluten free setting.  too. After being without wheat for 5 years and trying to forced down ready made breads yuck! The taste is delicious. Sweeter than most breads. You have to try her browning mix it is great. You wont believe it is not wheat. I read the ingredients several times. I havent had any abdominal problems or broke out with blister on my hands so I am certain it dose not have any wheat. I have made 5 loafs and all have turned out great.

1 STAR = Durability; 5 STARs = FUN; 4 STARs = Educational Value; 4.5 STARs = OVERALL RATING. Grapes of whatever color cannot alter the fact that they are too delicious to be available long enough for a "durability" rating.

When a Certain Someone in the household decorates cold cereal with seedless grapes, the purchase of grapes is a serious avocation. Breakfast becomes an Art Form, and the quotation "To EACH...HIS/HER OWN" must be properly respected. 

Colorful bowl-fuls add an ingredient of Optimism to each day, and as such, must be part of one's Litany of Thanksgiving. So saith Reviewer mcHAIKU on an unusually drab, moist Autumn day that needs an infusion of COLOR from an arching rainbow of grapes

dieters. My local is no longer carrying it, so I am happy to see it on the list at Amazon. One hint: reduce the cooking time by a minute less than the lowest number of total minutes. By the time the pasta is drained and reheated in the sauce a sec it will be a perfect al dente texture and will hold its shape

All of the Dreamfields Pasta products have exceeded my expectations. I am diabetic and need the benefit of lower carb higher fiber foods. Dreamfields pasta really helps. It cooks just like ordinary pasta, you won't be able tell a difference in the way it cooks and the taste is that of better brand pastas. It is worth the trouble to find (my local store won't stock it)and worth the bit of extra money.

****
Tazo Assorted Black and Green Teas and Herbal Infusions includes one or two of each:
AWAKE:  plain ordinary black tea, a little bitter
CALM:  nice chamomile tea
CHAI BLACK TEA:  an okay chai black tea with caffeine
CHINA GREEN TIPS:  great green tea experience, Tazo's best, no "natural flavorings"
DECAFFEINATED CHAI: an okay chai black tea without caffeine
EARL GREY BLACK TEA:  a disappointing perfumy, intense, black tea experience 
LOTUS:  decaf green tea with lotus flower, one of my favorite Tazo's
PASSION HERBAL INFUSION:  hibiscus-y, intense, caffeine-free, and luxurious
WILD SWEET ORANGE:  orange herbal tea, some complex overtones perhaps
ZEN:  mild, relaxed green tea

Their ingredients include: black tea, green tea, hibiscus flowers, chamomile flowers, lemongrass, citric acid, natural flavors, spearmint leaves, blackberry leaves, cinnamon, rooibos, ginger root, rose hips, orange peel, rose petals, licorice root, safflower, black pepper, lemon verbena leaves, cardamom, cloves, peppermint leaves, chicory, sarsaparilla root, lemon balm leaf, star anise, and red poppy flowers. 

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea. In general I'm not a big fan of tea with flavorings added, preferring the subtleness and authentic taste of the real thing.

Overall, the green teas seem good. The herbal infusions are fine. The black teas tend to turn bitter if you don't brew them very briefly...even then they have bitter overtones. Tazo's assortment, and Tazo teas in general, are fine---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not anywhere near as good as Numi, or Aspen, or other super premium teas made with only "real" ingredients and minus all of the flavorings. I'm more used to these high quality teas, which Tazo attempts to be, but disappoints...so overall Tazo Assorted gets a 3.5 to a 4. For this review, I'm rounding up, since so many people seem to enjoy these teas, and I'm in the clear minority. If your tea experience so far is drinking commercial teas of a lower quality, no doubt Tazo's teas will appeal to you, as they are a great improvement. They have a lot of variety and many interesting tea experiences. If you don't enjoy Tazo's teas, though, know that there are many, many teas made with all real ingredients, teas that cost only a fraction more, that may be just the thing you were looking for.

I have been weight training and trying to eat a higher protein diet.  I can no longer bear the sight of turkey, egg-white omelets or cottage cheese.  I dislike artificial sweeteners (mostly due to their taste) so I don't care for any pre-made shakes I have tried.  I turned to whey protein (bleck...maybe more experimentation will yield something better)and soy protein (bleck redux) but couldn't stand them.

But I like this!  I wouldn't eat it plain (it's not THAT good), but the taste is easily coverable with yummy and healthy additives.  This morning I made a "shake" that was 1C OJ (Tropicana Grovestand), 1/4C (appx) pure pomegranate juice, 1/4C egg whites (22g protein), 1/4C (appx) plain non-fat yogurt, and one banana. I blended these together with a few ice cubes, and yum!  Even my kids love it!  

It probably has a lot of naturally occuring sugar from the fruits and yogurt, but I am happy with the content and nutrients, and I can drink it happily without forcing it down!  

I have tried the Honeyville dried fruits and been pretty happy with them as well (much better blueberries than for pancakes), so I will look forward to adding these for variety when I can't find good fresh fruit

I use this as an inexpensive alternative to GNC protein powders.  It is completely natural and almost 100% protein.  Low carb count.  Highly bioavailable protein.  

When mixed with only water it does have a strange aftertaste.  I use powdered Nestles that only has 2 carbs or so and it has definitely improved the taste and removed any aftertaste.  

Do not use a shaker bottle with this.  Shaking the egg whites will cause them to foam, ( since they want to increase in volume).  Use a whisk or fork.

I have used this product for baking power-type bars and it has worked flawlessly.  I am confident that it would work with other dishes.  However, I am not sure if I would use it for meringues.  I haven't tested it, but it does seem to increase in volume rather quickly.  Maybe it could be used as a last resort for fresh egg whites

I bought the first one at the Las Vegas Bellagio hotel, the price tag on it was over $18. All that you have to do is add hot water. I have put them in my desk drawer and brief case and used them in my coffee to make wonderfully flavored mochas in the morning or afternoon for a pick-me-up. Of course, as cocoa they are outstanding with just water

I put butter and the Walden Farms Sugar Free Syrup on my pancakes.  Sometimes, I'll use Splenda, almonds and cinnamon in the mix or Splenda with a cut up Godiva Sugar Free Dark Chocolate Bar.  It's amazing that I get to eat these yummy low-carb pancakes and still lose weight at the end of the week :o

An excellent product that is exactly the same as used in most theaters to flavor their popcorn.  Economically priced, this canola oil based flavoring adds a smooth, rich flavor to a bucket of homemade popcorn.  The canola oil offers many health advantages over that great tasting wad of real butter, and has the same wonderful flavor

This is a good matcha for the price. The best matcha can be much more expensive but well worth it, espcially if you happen to study the Japanese tea ceremony or you are a tea connoseur. If you do get this type of tea, it is wise to buy a proper bamboo wisk and sift it first, otherwise it can get lumpy. Making matcha the traditional way is well worth the effort and there is a LOT to learn about it. Some say to master the tea ceremony can take years.
      
As far as the health benefits go, there is a lot of talk about green tea being good for you and I must say, I feel really good now that I am drinking it 1-3 days per week and I have even lost a few pounds. Matcha does have caffine and if I have more than two or three bowls I will definately feel it. It's probably a wise idea to not drink too much matcha before bed! Green and black tea both have caffine for the most part. Different teas have different amounts of caffine. It's a good idea to read labels carefully and do your research if you are sensitive to caffine or must avoid it. The type of caffine in a beverage also has a lot to do with how people respond to it. Caffine also has a different effect on everyone depending on your body. Some people get jittery, others don't and the more caffine you consume the less you will tend to feel the effects of it. I tend to feel jittery with coffee or soda but not with tea. 
      
Matcha is also great for smoothies, baking, ice cream and much, much more. Another note; Fresh matcha is a very bright green color, old matcha gets a darker pine-gray color to it and can taste bitter or ashy with a clumpy consistancy. Always note the date on the can. To avoid stale green tea, I reccommend storing it in an airtight bag and keeping it in the fridge. Stale tea isn't noticable when you put it in a smoothie or cake but if you make a hot beverage you will notice a big difference in the quality. 
      
Matcha is generally served with sweets and is good paired with fruity or vanilla desserts but it tends to clash with chocolate. Of course mochi (sweet rice cakes) go very well with matcha and are the traditional choice but unless you live near an Asian market, or you're a good cook, they can be hard to come by and have a short shelf life. The frozen Mochi ice cream nuggets are a good option too and sold in a lot of grocery stores. 
      
I reccommend this tea if you are new to drinking matcha. If you love it, it's the tastiest matcha in it's price range and if you hate it, at least you didn't waste too much cash. If you are taking tea lessons it's a good 'practice' tea and won't break your pocketbook, especially when you find out the price of tea bowls, fukusa, natsume, furo and the other utensils used in a tea ceremony!    
      
Regardless if you study Chado or if you are a casual tea drinker, I encourage all tea lovers to try matcha. The methods of making and preparing matcha are over 800 years old and when you taste it, you certainly understand why it's never gone out of style!

Two other reviewers have already spoken. The most recent one attempting to undermine what the first reviewer had said. Actually, the first reviewer DOES know what he is talking about. Green tea DOES contain caffeine. This from an expert source: 

Caffeine 

Although black tea is thought to have the highest caffeine content of all tea, this is actually untrue. Green tea has more caffeine. However it must be understood that because of other compounds, the caffeine in green tea functions in a special and balancing way. The caffeine in green tea is surrounding by tannic acid compounds, which inhibit it from surging all at once into our bloodstream. In a sense, the caffeine in green tea is time-released into our bloodstream. This time-release effect makes the stimulation gentle and quite pleasant. It also allows us to feel the effects of green tea for an extended period of time, and outlasts the effects experienced by our friends, who are drinking coffee or cola. The effect of green tea makes us free of agitation and nervousness, and its blissful stimulation feels good to the senses.

Enough said.........enjoy your tea............

This club is awesome! I got my first sauce within 5 days, it was one I had never tried, Bucky Goldstien's hot sauce. There was a little gold label on the neck that said it was a Texas Shoot out winner. Man was it deelish! I put it on everything. If the rest of the sauces are this good it is a winner. I don't know how they do it for so cheap it would cost you the same or more to buy these at the store. I highly recommend this. I'm sorry I only bought the 6 months now

I believe, I bought this tea before under a different name and have been searching for it ever since. It's flavor is strong and sweet and wonderful.  I would buy their spearmint tea along with it.  I'm not sure they produce it any longer, but the I liked the spearmint even more.  It had the same strength of flavor and sweetness.  I highly recommend this product

When I first had this tea, the taste was familar, as was the sensation that I couldn't immediately tell if I loved or hated it.  What it reminded me of was those hard red candies called "fireballs."  It is a very strong and spicey tea.  I am now buying it in multiple packs of 50 which I keep in the freezer for freshness, so I guess you could say that I made up my mind.

This tea always brings me back home. As a former Seattle resident I REALLY missed this tea when I moved back East, and the amount I could bring back from my occasional visits was just never enough. I'm thrilled that I can now order this tea and enjoy it whenever I want to. That rush when you open the package and are overwhelmed by the cinnamon and orange smells is incredible and it goes everywhere. Given the recent weather this tea is perfect for curling up in front of the fireplace and relaxing. After bringing some to work a good bit of my office is now addicted as well, but after a couple of giveaways I've made them order there own! I've also developed a liquer recipe for it, adapted from a Kahlua recipe, and of all the liquers I make it is hands-down the favorite amongst my friends.

After much deliberation about wedding favors, I ended up going the edible route and bought the Leonidas chocolate favors from Amazon.  I highly recommend these for many reasons - one, they are yummy and go well with champagne; two, they are shipped fast and no hassles; three, it's super easy - you get a box of nicely wrapped favors and you can just take it to your reception and be done with it.  All in all, I was very happy with this choice

Everytime I visit Slough (UK) from the US I eat at Nando's.  In fact, I eat there nearly everyday.  Why? Well...the only other viable food choices in Slough are: spread meat sandwiches (with butter, sweet corn, free-range eggs, rocket, and mature cheese) at Amys (yuck!)..."unnamed" department store (made me sick)...or McDonalds/Burger King/Pizza Hut/Subway (I can get those down the street). But most importantly, it's the Peri Peri Sauce!  

Though created for Nando's chicken, Peri Peri sauce is especially tastey as a dipping sauce for french fries.  Thanks to Amazon.com, I can enjoy Peri Peri sauce everyday right here in the United States.

Warning: the "hot" is plenty hot enough.  The extra hot is ridiculously hot

I really enjoyed this green curry meal. The veggies in it were mostly juilienned, so they were all in long strips, which was fun to eat. The veggies were crisp, the proportion of sauce to veggie was great, and the sauce was flavorful. It isn't my top favorite, but it is very good

I was not let down by this product.  Though I had to wait a few days for it to arrive, when I could just walk down the road and buy one at the gas station, and the price for shipping was a little much, it was well worth the wait.  It came in its own tube, which is braggable, but the M&Ms were smaller than I am used to.  Still, they deliver great taste at a price that even the most underpaid of us can appreciate

C. Howard Company has been around since 1934, when Mr. Howard formed it in New York City to sell his violet mints. Actually, due to the way he wrote his signs, it has been "Choward Violet Mints" ever since then! So successful were these mints, that they were soon followed by "Violet Scented Gum."

This gum is very hard to describe. It has a wonderful, perfumed scent that makes you think that it will taste like some sort of chemical, but nothing can be further from the truth. This gum has a delicate taste that clears the mouth and freshens the breath.

When I was young, a local drug store carried a wide range of candies, including Violet Mints and Violet Gum. Whenever I could I would go and buy a pack, and to this day the taste of these candies takes me back to my youth and that drug store with the giant racks of candy.

So, if you want a gum that tastes like NOTHING you've ever had before, one that freshens your breath and excites your palette, then buy this gum. It's fantastic

Although they are a little bit sweet for me, everyone who has tried them really liked them, and had no idea that they were gfcf.  I am ordering more..

****
Tazo's Wild Sweet Orange Herbal Infusion is a nice orange herbal tea. It contains lemongrass, blackberry leaves, citric acid, rose hips, spearmint leaves, natural flavors, orange peel, safflowers, hibiscus flowers, rose petals, natural orange essence, ginger root and licorice root. It is not sweet, very fruity, and not subtle at all, a wonderful tea if you enjoy orangey teas.

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.

On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a lively blend of sweet citrus herbs and orange essences. Sweet, yet tart, this is a cup of liquid sunshine, radiating multi-layered orange flavors with exotic hints of spice and a distinctive floral finish. Wild, indeed." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Wild Sweet Orange as "tart, sweet, smooth, licorice". Tazo describes the aroma as "oranges, roses, lime".  This is pretty accurate, although the words give hope that the taste of the tea never quite approaches.

I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Wild Sweet Orange gets only four stars.

From Italy's famed milk region, Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz is guaranteed to satisfy. The birthplace of the Italian Renaissance is also the birthplace of the world's most delectable beverage, Tuscan Whole Milk. Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and Dante Alighieritable were known to imbibe in Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz's sweeth frothy goodness. Some say that Milk was the inspiration for the Mona Lisa. 

Now the milk growers of Tuscan have released  Tuscan 2% Low Fat Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz...a lighter taste with less creamy overtones.  In my opinion, an improvement over their earlier release.  Bon appetit

At first I was a little disappointed in the overall size of the popped corn--small compared to the typical yellow variety I'm used to--but the flavor was excellent.  Almost every kernel popped(save for one or two per 1 qt. (popped) serving)!  I love this variety of popcorn and am SO glad to find it at a good price and availability

Marmite is an aquired taste.  It's a slightly salty yeasty spread you can use on toast or as a sandwich.  It's supposed to be good for you, but most people eat it just because they like how it tastes.  

Marmite isn't easy to find in the U.S, but you can get it in larger "health food" type chains like Sun Harvest Farms and Whole Foods Market where they charge about $5.00 for a 125g jar.  One would consider what is charged for shipping as well as product price when deciding whether or not ordering Marmite online is a value

I have been faithfully buying Omaha Steaks products for years.  In MY grocer's freezer and MY butcher, there is nothing the compares to the taste and quality of these burgers.  You get what you pay for -- this company delivers consistent quality again and again.  

I think other reviewers of Omaha Steaks product don't know how to use their grill. If you follow the step-by-step instructions: PRESTO -- perfect taste every time

These burgers are unbelievable. They are really fresh and juicy burgers with a distinctive meaty taste you will fall in love with if you love a great burger.  They are Omaha Steaks best product and the only thing I order from them. I actually love the packaging. Each burger comes individually wrapped in vacuum sealed plastic, which means I can keep them in the freezer until I am ready to eat them. Then defrost them in warm water and in 10 minutes I have fresh red meat, they have a nice peppery Angus beef smell, and they taste great. They never go to waste.  I find the meat I buy in the stores these days can't compare at all. Them smell of the meat doesn't smell fresh - more like plastic than meat. Ok, the Styrofoam cooler is a waste of packaging, and not environmentally friendly but they can be reused several times.

Amazon also has a great price on these. After a quick search around the web, this looks to be the best price

The freeze-dried peaches big (around 1/2 inch wide) and are not hard or crunchy.  Toddlers could eat these easily - they get soft in your mouth.  The flavor is delicious - sweet and slightly tangy.  The only problem we have is that we go through an entire can in a matter of minutes!  I like that they are totally natural - no added sugars or preservatives and the kids love them.  Honeyville strawberries are awesome as well.

Preserved lemons are one of those items that can become a secret ingredient in your dishes that everyone asks about.  I love to chop them finely and add to stews as they add a very distinct, deep flavor that most don't even recognize as lemon.  The overall flavor is more similar to lemon zest than lemon juice.  Used with green olives and chicken in a Tagine is one of the best traditional applications.  I've also added it in the italian dish Osso Bucco with great success.  Get some and try it

My order was processed for 2 days prior to being shipped (used standard shipping: 2 day processing & estimated arrival is 5-7 days). Less then 24 hours following the shipping confirmation email, the basket arrived at my address. It arrived 4 days earlier then I anticipated! 

Basket quality is strong. Coffee is packaged in paper containers (not the bags) but the Verona coffee comes in its own metal-hinged airtight tin. Cups have to be at least 8-12 oz. Basket comes plastic wrapped and finished with a cornstalk ribbon.

It's too bad Mr Somma has little appreciation for Marmite and a naive, propaganda-inspired understanding of history.  Marmite is an acquired taste and has to be used properly (sparingly).  Used with a light hand, it is a savory delight, working equally well in soups or on bread and toast.  It will be an absolute disaster if one tries to use it like peanut butter or jam.  One only needs a little of the best things in life

Man I love me some cukes!  So much so that I take them everywhere I go.  Foolishly I brought a 2-pack with me recently on a flight to London.  The TSA eye-balled me for several minutes, discussed the cukes for 20 minutes more, and finally pulled me out of line.  "Cucumbers are 90% liquid!" they told me, "NO LIQUIDS on any flights from now on!!"  I was strip-searched, questioned for 6 hours, forced to remove all liquid from my bladder, and held in a locked room overnight until the authorities finally let me go.  

I have come to the unpleasant realization that the terrorists are winning.  We can never beat them if we are always playing "catch-up" with them, enacting new rules AFTER they try something.  It seems the only way to win is to declare indefinite martial law, place soldiers everywhere, and arrest everyone suspicious.  Unfortunately this tactic didn't help the Soviets win the cold war, and besides-- if the terrorists "hate us for our freedom" aren't we just playing into their hands by removing those freedoms (which we seem to be doing a little at a time now anyway)?  If we're going to play into their hands, why not just cut to the chase and give them what they want now-- DEFUSE the whole situation by pushing for a free and seperate Palestine in the occupied west bank, and remove our troops from Iraq and Saudi Arabia (substituing a U.N. or NATO peacekeeping force in Iraq).  Then they'd have NOTHING to fight for anymore.  Al Quaeda might be seen as heroes at first, but would look craven and evil to most muslims if they continued to try and blow up infidels across the globe, thus completely alienating them from the peaceful muslim majority.  Checkmate!  Besides, are we not a "Christian nation" for the most part?  Shouldn't we follow Christ's example by "turning the other cheek"?  

It's hard to believe a simple cucumber could make me rethink all of my long-held Republican ideals (McCain on '08, baby!!), but if I have to choose between eternal war, and a humbling (maybe embarassing) peace, well. . . it's no contest.  When a dirty, smelly hippy flashes the "peace" sign at me, I will smile and return the favor.  GOD BLESS AMERICA and the amazing CUCUMBER!

HP sauce - or Brown Sauce as it is known in the UK - is the perfect companion for sausages, burgers and almost any savoury food. It is a thick (like ketchup) sauce with a stronger flavour than most other commonly available bottled food sauces. Brown Sauce is the final touch that makes Bangers (sausages) and Mash a great comfort food. Try it - you will never touch ketchup again

I make Thai curries occasionally, and the mortar and pestle I was using was tiny.  I would have to grind up all the spices in batches to avoid them from spilling out.  I finally broke down and looked for a larger set and found this one.  I debated between the 2 and 3 cup version, because I didn't have a good feel for how big they really were.  I ended up getting the 2 cup version, and I love it.  It is very large - plenty big enough for making a good size curry paste.  Its also very heavy, because, as advertised, is made of a solid chunk of granite.  It also looks great, attractive enough to leave out on the counter, and people constantly comment on it when visiting.  Mine doesn't look quite like the picture on amazon.  The outside of the bowl (mortar) and the top half of the pestle appear to be polished in the picture, which is not the case for the one I received.  Very heavy and solid - a great purchase.

"There is a garden overlooking the Yangtze River gorge where an elderly man contemplates his life while sipping a cup of Green Ginger. Perhaps you would like to join him." ~on each tea packet

A friend sent me this tea and I've been in love with the pear flavor. It is quite exotic and fragrant. The ingredients are green teas, natural flavors, ginger and lemongrass. 

This tea begs to be blended with orange blossom honey. 

I've tasted many teas and this is by far the most exotic tea I've tried yet. This is pear ginger bliss.

C. Howard Company has been around since 1934, when Mr. Howard formed it in New York City to sell his violet mints. Actually, due to the quirky way he wrote his signs, it has been "Choward Violet Mints" ever since then!

Violets are very hard to describe. They have a wonderful, perfumed scent that makes you think that they will taste like some sort of chemical, but nothing can be further from the truth. These candies have a delicate taste that clears the mouth and freshens the breath.

When I was young, a local drug store carried a wide range of candies, including Violets (at least that's what I called them). Whenever I could I would go and buy a pack, and to this day the taste of Violets takes me back to my youth and that drug store with the giant racks of candy.

So, if you want a candy that tastes like NOTHING you've ever had before, then buy these candies. They are fantastic

It's quick.  It's really easy to make.  If you're starving, it works well in a pinch.  You can obey the simple package directions of boiling for a few minutes then adding the flavor packet, or do what I do.  I like to boil it & drain it, then add many different ingredients to make an actually filling meal. 

It's a bit bland, but what do you expect for under 25 cents a package?  A great value for the money

There's nothing you can't do with ramen. It makes a pretty good soup. You can remove the flavoring packet and use it in casseroles or on top of pizza. Ants like it, too. The noodles can be used in a seemingly infinite number of dishes--three ramen casserole, for example. It's great camping, dorm, or space food. The noodles can even be crunched up and used as a faux buckwheat pilliow. Ramen makes a very good loofah, although be advised it's for single use only

After reading many of the reviews I think I have figured out the problem.  You guys have the wrong POD brewer. I have a BUNN and tried various different pods with it.  The Aloha Island pods are the best of the lot. I have been in search of a good cup of coffee for years.  The answer is a BUNN and the Aloha dark roast Pods.  I bought two el-cheapo pod brewers including black and decker and senseo.  I couldn't get a good cup of coffee even with the Aloha pods.  Once I ditched the cheap pod brewer and spent the $200.00 on the BUNN, all my troubles were over.  You guys will never be happy until you get a good pod brewer

I have used this matcha daily for about 6 weeks now. It is very good for what I use it for. I make my own version of Starbucks Green Tea Frappuccino. (Once that drink name started to roll of my kids' tongues easily - I realized I was spending too much money on these drinks - and daily!)I am not familiar with various grades of matcha, but did not want something pre-sweetened or modified because I wanted to control the sugar, etc. I make my frappuccino like this: sorry - I do not measure - so you may have to modify these amounts because I am guessing!

1 1/2c milk
2 heaping spoonfuls (the spoon that's included) green tea powder
1/8c simple syrup (I make it myself and keep in fridge for week or so)
10+ice cubes (adjust to your taste - depends on size of cubes)

Blend this in a blender - longer than you think - pulse first then blend for a bit - I scrape down a bit bc the powder flies around a little and you don't want to lose any. (Simple syrup is 1c water, 1c sugar heated until sugar dissolves) It is much easier than it may sound - I make these daily in the morning. I hope this helps anyone else out there who is addicted to the GT Frappuccino - it is slightly different (I think they use a different gt powder and a honeydew syrup), but I liked mine MORE within the first week of having them!

This matcha powder came in very nice packaging with a measuring spoon to use as well.  The quality of the green tea powder was a bit less than I expected (compared to my past experiences with matcha), but I think its all about quantity here - I've done a lot of creative stuff with the powder thusfar, my favorite being the homemade green tea ice cream

I suppose I'm unsophisticated about matcha teas since this is the first I've tried, but I really, really enjoy this matcha. It's smooth, mellow, and slightly sweet. I'm picky about loose green teas for steeping; some of those are bitter, & I DON'T like bitter tea. So my favorite teas are this matcha & white loose leaf teas. The cost is honestly too steep for me to buy other better rated matcha for the flavor, so I'm happy I can get this much tea for the price (I've got 3 kids & a lot of other priorities; maybe when I retire...). And for the price, I'm getting all the health benefits of any other matcha (you get all the antioxidants out of matcha since you ingest the whole leaf; brewing teas often makes the extracted antioxidants bitter), plus I don't feel too guilty using it on my face, either. Perfectly nice matcha for the beginner & the frugal. Gave some to my sister, also a novice to matcha, & she loved it too. Worth a try for the price

We are a 2 person household with one diabetic and one low-carber.  We love this pasta and eat it at least once per week.  We haven't noticed any appreciable rise in blood glucose level, or any negative effects on low-carb dieting while using this product.  Of course we limit the portion and eat it with plenty of protein and vegetables, which probably helps prevent glucose/insulin spikes.  I think we have had success because the proportion of pasta to protein and vegetables is low.  But essentially this pasta is delicious and we highly recommend it

When you have to impress the in-laws or that new girlfriend... or actually whenever you just want the perfect burger!!  These babies are preformed, shrink wrapped, and are perfect for the grill.  I have yet to have one be less than perfect.  The difference between these burgers and the ones from Krogers are immense!  I usually grill mine outside, but even when we put them on the fry pan, they come out fantastic.  I can not recommend these burgers highly enough.

I usually wait until Omaha offers a really good steak deal with free burgers thrown in and then make my order in bulk. Always arrives when they say it will and never fails to please.  One aside... the "extras" like knives and cutting boards are throw-aways... wait til there are good meat sales!!!  Also... try the beef tips... They are to die for!!

Enjoy,

Ja

I recently received a shipment of Omaha burgers.  I normally order the filets.  The burgers were perfect size for a hamburger bun, they are pre-formed and uniformly sized -- that way they're all done cooking at the same time.  The ground beef was high quality and didn't shrink at all and the burgers had full flavor.

They are a little pricey for burgers, but I will order them again for their quality.  They're perfect when having a small group of friends over for a cookout

This tea is so good! I was first introduced to it at Starbucks, also. I love it hot or cold, and it's really aromatic. If I had to only have one tea, this would be it. 

It's a pretty color, has a great smell and taste. Even friends of mine who aren't tea drinkers love it.

I COULD NOT GET ENOUGH OF THE BACON-WRAPPED FILET OF TOP SIRLOIN.  I AM NOW GOING TO BUY THE STEAKS AGAIN FOR MY FATHER-N-LAW AND HOPE THAT HE WILL BE WILLING, ONCE AGAIN TO SHARE-- I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT I NOW EAT MEAT--THEY ARE SO MOUTH WATERING GOOD !

I'm not Indian, but I really love Indian cuisine.  This meal has got quite a kick to it.  It's good in a pinch but if you've got a decent restaurant nearby, it can't compare to takeout.  Do not recommend eating if you've got a buzz, find a safer (milder) alternative

I generally hate frozen or pre-packed food but this specific one is a definite exception. The taste is subtle and not too spicy. When you are in the mood to have a light meal, this packet is perfect and you have the hot food in 2 minutes.

I was completely satisfied with this purchase.  The preserved lemons were perfect (dinner guests loved the special flavor they added to a chicken/almonds/olive dish) and the company shipped the order very quickly.  A quality item, well-packed and promptly shipped, at a fair price.

Preserved lemons are one of those items that can become a secret ingredient in your dishes that everyone asks about.  I love to chop them finely and add to stews as they add a very distinct, deep flavor that most don't even recognize as lemon.  The overall flavor is more similar to lemon zest than lemon juice.  Used with green olives and chicken in a Tagine is one of the best traditional applications.  I've also added it in the italian dish Osso Bucco with great success.  Get some and try it

White Rabbit came into my life on a hot summer day.  It was the munchie of the moment as I watched a K-Drama.  How Asian can it get?  After trying to peel off the edible inner wrapper, and all you White Rabbit fans are laughing in recognition now, I decided it couldn't hurt, so I ate it.  

I have since met a Korean lady living in Hawaii, and she confided having been raised eating this candy.  It was an instant bond of sisterhood.

I love the fact that this candy is prepared from rational ingredients.  they're not full of garbage-y chemicals.  Individually wrapped, and delicious out of the freezer, they're a great treat

*****
Tazo's China Green Tips Green Tea is a slightly stronger green tea than Tazo's Zen, and I liked that it doesn't contain Tazo's omnipresent "natural flavors" that almost all of their other teas contain, which to me is not an advantage. I like a natural, real taste with real ingredients sans vague "natural flavors" and sans flavorings, sans essences, etc. China Green Tips delivers this in a cleaner, purer way than Tazo's other teas. I liked this green tea!

The ingredients in China Green Tips are simply spring-harvested green teas from China. It contains caffeine.

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague and unnecessary for a super premium tea. China Green Tips has none of these "natural flavors" and it shows in the quality and cleanliness of the tea experience.

On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a traditional Chinese green tea with a delicate fresh taste and a light green liquor." This is the perfect way to describe this tea! On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of China Green Tips as "grassy, vegetative, sweet, ricey". Tazo describes the aroma as "vegetative, popcorn". 

I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi or Aspen. Still, this tea is excellent, so I'm breaking my tradition with Tazo teas and giving it five stars. If you enjoy super premium teas, and are stuck with Tazo for some reason, choose China Green Tips and you will be quite satisfied. I can't honestly say that about any other Tazo tea.

This is a classic green tea that brews up to a pale amber liquor with a fine grassy scent. Savor this tea for a delicate and elusive experience. The taste is barley, sweet hay and the faintest herbal taste. The aftertaste is very mild and fresh.

Green tea is touted for its health benefits--not just antioxidants but also because it is supposed to help you lose weight!! Green tea averages about 10-30 mg of caffeine as opposed to 90 mg in a cup of coffee. Tazo does not put how much caffeine is in their tea on the box

My friend got me hooked on hot chocolate from Angelina's Cafe in Paris, and Marie Belle is the closest to Angelina's that I can find in the States. It isn't like typical American hot chocolate. It has a very intense, dark chocolate flavor, undoubtably due to the 60-70% cocoa content of the chocolate shavings used and the omission of vanilla flavoring. It is also not as sweet, which I came to prefer after a few cups.

A few recommendations would be to use milk (you can even use skim without hurting the results), and 1 cup of milk instead of 1/2 cup. If you get this product, I'd also recommend that you invest in an AeroLatte or some other milk frother. I could never get the chocolate pieces evenly distributed without it. 

Marie Belle is a little pricey, but it is worth every penny if you are looking for the perfect hot chocolate.

Ah, Haribo. This Brand is famous for its delicious and juicy gummi bears alone, but they do indeed stand out from the rest of the pack. Haribo Gummi Bears are most definitely not only the best gummi candy in the world (apart from that straight from Germany), but they are also one of the best candies in existence, period. I guarantee that you will not be disappointed in these candies or I will eat my gummi hat

If you like hot sauce, you'll like this harissa.  This harissa is salty and hot, with a roasted pepper taste to it.  Very good to use as an ingredient in Moroccan cooking or as a condiment.  My spouse is from Morocco and says this is an authentic tasting harissa.  A staple in my house!  We love it on chicken and sandwiches, especially

Some reviewers claim not to like the taste or smell of gunpowder green tea. To each his own. It should be noted that preparing green tea does require more care than other teas. Never boil the water in an aluminum kettle, or steep the tea in an aluminum container. This ruins the taste of the brew. It is also important to let the water cool before pouring it onto the tea leaves. Once the water has boiled let it cool for 2-3 minutes, and then steep the tea for 2-3 minutes...no more. I have found Temple Of Heaven Gunpowder to be a superior and delicious green tea

I bought this tea on a whim while browsing through a Chinese supermarket, thinking that the name would make for good coffeetable conversation.  However, the taste of this product is amazing.  It is easily the best green tea I've ever had, and it's perfect with a little honey or sugar, and a shot of lemon juice or mint.  Excellent tea with a great aftertaste.  You won't be disappointed

 An east coast friend of mine recently visited me and brought some Tastykake products with her, including the butterscotch krimpets.  They were so wonderful.  Far better than Little Debbie or Hostess.  I still have her send me packages of these every now and then.  It is good that they do not have them where I live (CA), otherwise I'd eat them all the time.

	It really is a shame that the Tastykake Brand has only established itself in the Northeastern portion of the U.S.A., being that the rest of the world is missing out on the finest pre-packaged snack pastry on the face of this earth.  For those who are unfortunate enough not to know what a Tastykake is, it's like a Little Debbie or a Hostess, which is centered out of the Philadelphia area.  And should you happen to run into anybody from the Philadelphia area and ask them about this line of products, they will inevitably tell you that once you've experienced the snack God that is the Tastykake Butterscotch Krimpet, those Drake's Coffee Cakes and Hostess Twinkies will no longer have any appeal.

	It's hard to put into words just how fantastic these spongey, moist, and vanilla butterscotch frosted guys are.  Seriously, the Butterscotch Krimpet can even beat out many fresh baked bakery products, despite being mass manufactured and factory sealed in boxes.  I seriously suggest grabbing a big jug of chocolate milk and ordering a box of these on Amazon right now, especially if you're not from the Mid-Atlantic region and are under the false assumption that Hostess is a quality product.  If so, you will be blown away by the krimpet's culinary goodness.  

	Tastykake's seemingly pompous slogan goes, "Nobody bakes a cake as tasty as a Tastykake."  Once you experience the Butterscotch Krimpet, you'll realize that they have more than substantial reason to gloat.

Heats up well in the office microwave and very tasty!  This is one of my favoriate packaged Indian meals.  I love that these meals have no preservatives and I can recognize all the contents by name.  This one is high in fiber (12 grams), and not too high in fat for me (6 grams, of which 1 saturated).  And, the serving size for this meal is the entire package, which is very filling!  For only 363 calories

"Wow" is the only way to describe this.  New to the sugar-free world, I have recently had some distasteful experiences with sugar-free products.  So I half wondered if I'd end up chucking this stuff in disgust after trying it.  Boy was I in for a surprise. 

I'd tried Lindt and Ghiradelli 70% chocolates and frankly I had to choke them down.  One taste of this and I realized I might have to ignore the warning on the label not to eat too much.  Rich and smooth is how I'd describe it.  I am just amazed that a sugar-free food could beat two of the most decadent names in chocolate

Purchased this bar along with the almond bars.  Both were amazing and I will purchase again. I have tried them all, but these are by far superior. Have liked the Pure De-lite Imported Pure Belgian Chocolate Bars in the past, but tried these and will not go back. Nothing comes close to the rich taste and texture in SugarFree and carb lite bars. At approximately $1/oz, a fair price for a great product! I also received an email from the company asking of I needed special cold shipping since I lived in Texas. I have purchased since and will buy again.

Another great offering from Godiva! I've been anxiously waiting the "G" collection's yearly release since they started. When I saw that they were offering the American Pies collection, of course I had to try it. Exquisite!! Seven different flavors of old American favorites, in large, beautifully colored "pie" pieces. Pecan Pie, Strawberry pie, chocolate-peanut butter pie, all favorites! For a limited time, so don't miss out! And do yourselves a favor...get the original "G" collection while you're at it. A whopping FIFTEEN flavors, each more decadent than the last. I never get less than the 30 piece, that way I know I'm going to get TWO of each flavor!! Godiva is one of the best chocolatiers out there, and probably the best when it comes to dealing with the public, they've been doing it for a long time

I am not a huge fan of Godiva chocolates. I realize it is a popular brand and a big favorite for many, but their chocolate has always tasted slightly waxy to me, and their fillings lack creaminess. I recently had the opportunity to taste the Godiva "G" Collection and was surprised at the spectacular presentation and by many of the superb flavors. This new, high-end line was presented over the Christmas holidays with much success. Many places sold out long before December 25.
 
The core collection consists of fifteen selections, crafted in sleek shapes and adorned with brilliant colors. The overall presentation is strikingly beautiful and super-luxurious. Godiva calls this collection "A true fusion of art and chocolate." The individual jewel-like pieces look like miniature paintings - tiny masterpieces. The Passion Orange Heart is gorgeous and tastes as wonderful as it looks. Mixed Berry, a buttery reduction of pureed raspberries, strawberries, and wild blackberries is another standout - truly exceptional. The Praline Crunch, in which hazelnut praline is combined with rich milk chocolate, is delicious, as is the 3-sided Vanilla Mascarpone made with fresh exotic vanilla from Madagascar. The Orange Gianduja in a dark chocolate ganache is exquisite, and Key Lime Pie chocolate cream is unusual and good. I didn't like the coconut truffle at all, however. I hate to sound too picky, but given the high cost per piece, I should have loved, or at least liked, every single one! Also, the ingredients list includes hydrogenated fats and artificial flavors - which certainly diminish the quality of the line.

A young American, Norman Love, created the "G" Collection. He was the ex-Executive Pastry Chef for the Ritz-Carlton Hotels and is founder of Ganache Chocolates in Fort Myers, Florida. 

Weighing in at about $100 per pound, these chocolates are worth their weight in gold. Although I would rate most of the pieces 4-5 stars for flavor and a solid 5 stars for visual presentation, there are extraordinary chocolates on the market today - Belgian, French, Swiss, Dutch, American - which are better in terms of fresh, natural ingredients and consistent quality and they are definitely easier on the pocketbook.

Godiva's "G" Collection does make a superlative gift and I highly recommend it for those very special occasions. This is memorable candy!

I am thinking of ordering two bags at a time because it can be stored in the freezer.  I find it works best in recipes when I sift it through a collander

This matcha powder came in very nice packaging with a measuring spoon to use as well.  The quality of the green tea powder was a bit less than I expected (compared to my past experiences with matcha), but I think its all about quantity here - I've done a lot of creative stuff with the powder thusfar, my favorite being the homemade green tea ice cream

These were ordered for my DH's birthday. He is a huge Lindt fan and prefers the Hazelnut and Amaretto. When we get the mixed bag we always wind up trying to find a home for the white chocolate, dark chocolate varieties and never get our fill of our favorites. So this box fit the bill nicely

We have this tea all the time at a local restaurant - they serve it hot and we love it.  When the owner told us it was the same tea as they use to make Thai Iced Tea, I was thrilled to be able to order it.
The brewing instructions as so simple (especially because the tea comes in brewing bags) you don't need to be an expert or even familiar with brewing.  With ice and cream and surgar we have Thai Iced Tea or in the evening we can have a wonderful hot cup (or two or three)

The best flavor ever! What more can one say? These are creamy, and while they are more sweet than a real toasted marshmallow, these are worth searching for in any bag of mixed jelly beans. I don't eat very much candy, but if I find these I eat them! The toasted marshmallow Jelly Beans are irresistible.

If you are serious about tea drinking this brand is one of the best matcha's I've tried.  It is expensive but you get what you pay for.  Everyday green teas have been found to have a lot of antioxidants so I would only purchase this for the taste.  My take on sugar - it's like mixing sugar into a dry wine. Usually only black teas are sweetened in Asia.  Yes, there is a trend of sweetened tea drinks, but at least those are ice dessert drinks.  If you want the benefits of green tea, you might want to purcahse a lower priced matcha if you're going to mix it in other ingredients.

"There are few hours in life more agreeable than the hour dedicated to the ceremony known as afternoon tea." -Henry James, Portrait of a Lady 

This "English Breakfast" style tea is quite satisfying and has a rich flavor that is quite delicious. 

I'd like to say that their teas are best steeped for an extra 5-10 minutes to draw out all the delicious flavors. You can use a teapot or a coffee maker to make tea. Simply put the tea in a coffee filter or the tea bags in the coffee pot, then allow the boiling water to drip over the tea leaves. 

The sensual blend of exotic spices, teas and herbs used in their teas include a mixture of the following: Black tea, green tea, hibiscus flowers, chamomile flowers, lemongrass, spearmint leaves, blackberry leaves, cinnamon, Rooibos, Gingerroot, rose hips, orange peel, rose petals, licorice root, safflowers, black pepper, lemon verbena leaves, cardamom, cloves, peppermint leaves, chicory, sarsaparilla root, lemon balm leaf, star anise and red poppy flowers. 

This is a blend of black teas, but all their teas are worth trying. Passion and Chai are also favorites.

It's hard to be disappointed with a 25 cent meal.  And ramen noodles are sort of spiritual in that they allow one to eat and fast simultaneously.

I recommend college students and aspiring actors rotate their flavors.  One would think that one could go with Shrimp every time and never get sick of it, but I know from experience that one would be wrong.  This is a fine brand.  The noodles are firm, the seasoning's flavor strong but complex.  Recommend

Ferrero Rocher chocolates are pingpong-ball-sized chocolates, wrapped individually in gold foil, with ground hazelnuts mixed into the chocolate. The chocolate is a good, medium-strong chocolate, but ground hazelnuts do not have nearly the flavor that pureed ones have. Rochers are good, but Cote d'Or Bouchees have a better grade of chocolate, and the hazelnut puree inside also has almonds and cashews, and has a much more definite taste. Guylian Pralines also have more flavor than do these Rochers

Om tea is just delicious with a very interesting, smooth flavor you would never guess comes from cucumber and peach!  The combination is exquisite, and goes equally well with or without milk or sweetner.  This tea has quickly become my favorite, and has even prompted friends who come over to ask, "can you make some of the GOOD tea?"  Although it is very rare to find Om on the shelves of stores anymore (even those that cary other Tazo teas,) it is worth the search on line.  We order it by the case to be sure and never run out

Fresh made always tastes best, however Jaipur Vegetables Entree is an excellent item to keep in the cupboard. Long shelf life (18 months), take along when camping, or a fast lunch. 1 package is enough for 2 lite lunches for me. I mix with a little rice. Flavors are right on spot. My hubby was so surprised this dish came out of a package. (I pretty much cook everything from scratch) Calories are not outrageous and the sodium level is in my ballpark.......I give a Full 5 Stars.

My daughter loves Tasty Bite's Jaipur Vegetables. She calls the peas "yummy balls" and gets very excited when we have this for dinner. I mix in a bit of plain yogurt after it's been heated to cool the spices down and serve it with brown basmati rice. I like it, too, but she can actually eat an entire container herself. 5 stars because a kid-pleasing veggie deserves it

Well, it's very low carb, so you can't expect it to be amazing, but it serves it's purpose.  Gives me some pancakes when I can't normally eat them (on Atkins).  I add a few frozen blueberries to mine.  George Stella's pancake recipe tastes better, but these are more of a pancake consistancy.

Great stuff. Not only healthy, but keeps you going for a long time...must be a different type of natural caffeine or something. Just be careful about drinking it too close to bed time or you'll be up very late at night. Anytime I drink it too late, I wind up doing alot of stuff around the house...with bleary eyed pets (i.e., cats) staring at me and wondering when I'm going to sleep

I've received Cherry Cordial chocolates for Valentines Day, every year for 25 years from my wife. Like Porche, "there is no substitute" for that lucious liquid and real cherry center. But this new Hershey's product comes darn close. It has a soft center that tastes every bit like the original. I hope it's not just a seasonal offering, because I keep a bowl of them in our family room at all times

Cheetos are an awesome snack.  Okay, the dust from the Cheetos can get on your fingers.  Big deal.  Ever heard of "finger licking good?"  The only problem I have with Cheetos is stopping when I am eating them.  Cheetos are so crunchy and delicious that I find it tempting to eat the whole bag.  I love the strong cheesy flavor each Cheeto has.  You can keep your wimpy cheese puffs.  Give me delicious Cheetos.  They are what they are.  If you prefer another snack, then go eat that snack and leave the Cheetos for those of us that love them.  In fact, mail me your Cheetos if you are not going to eat them.

I had been looking for freeze-dried fruit since Cheerios started adding it in their cereal. All I could find, at decent prices, were the regular dried fruit with added sugars and very small bags of the freeze-dried berries. Now I use Honeyville's berries on all my cereals and the kids love it too. I also give it to my 10 month old and toddlers as a treat when berries are out of season. 
The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that there was a lot of powder at the bottom of the can where pieces had broken down. However, the kids liked that on their cereal too

I love tea and coffee; they are one of great pleaures of being an adult. I drink a lot of different teas and I enjoy herb teas, teasans, white tea with jasmine, and chai as well as a good strong cup of Yorkshire with some cream and sugar accompanied by a couple of McVities Digestive Biscuits (uh..cookies...that's just Brit for wheat cookies- they are delicious and Amazon carries them in the Gourmet section.) I am not above a bag of Lipton if it comes to that (which, quite frankly, I always hope it won't.)

Numi teas are quite simply, the most delicious teas I have ever had the pleasure to brew. The Flowering Dragon Lily should be brewed in a clear glass pot (also available at Amazon or at the Numi website) to see the amazing blossoming of the handsewn tea flower.  The brew time is only a few minutes but you should be aware that rushing this experience deprives you of the subtle aromas and slow beauty of the brew. Each blossom can be used for up to three small pots of tea. The simple beauty of the blossoming brew will enrich any break or meditation time you are taking. Your life will slow down to its lovely essence. This tea transports you. It's amazing.

I first became acquainted with Numi teas when I bought a box of Monkey King at the local co-op. What a shock to discover that the simple box of tea I bought contained a world of flavors, fragrances and satisfaction. Numi is committed to fair trade and giving back to the environment, too. There's just no downside to the experience. I've enjoyed many of thier teas and I've NEVER had a cup that was not subtle, charming and elegant.

Numi Tea becomes a wonderful experience instead of a quickly sloshed cup of caffeinated muck. It slows down your racing thoughts, halts your worries and refreshes your spirit. I know it sounds too good to be true but this tea is something rare and magical. (okay, the first time I had a shot of Wild Turkey, that was magical, too.) 

It's really good tea. Maybe you'll slow down a little and enjoy the moment. This tea could help you with that, No kidding

Just got back from France and didn't see this product when I was in Arles, near the Camargue.  Later, in Nice, it was served at a restaurant (Vin Sur Vin -- recommended) with my grilled bass.  It added such wonderful flavor to the fish, and to the accompanying vegetables.  I had no time to go looking for some there, so I'm thrilled to be able to order it on Amazon. There is a really special taste and texture to it.  The container on my table even had the signature of the man who had gathered the crystals.  It would make a wonderful gift to dinner hosts

I bought these cherry bars so that I'd have something to snack on in the office. I've bought a lot of different breakfast/nutrition bars and have grown used to boredom, disappointment, and sore jaw muscles when I chew them. I had no high expectations for these, but I liked my first one so much that I promptly unwrapped and ate a second. I wanted to make sure that I didn't just think it was good compared to all the horrible or boring bars I've eaten, but that it was actually good. It was. Don't get me wrong, a fresh chocolate chip cookie is better, but a chocolate chip cookie isn't a reasonable snack on its own, either.

So are these things healthy? Total fat is 9g, of which 6g are monounsaturated and 3g are polyunsaturated. None is trans fat. Total carbohydrate is 24g, of which 4g are fiber and 17g are sugar. Protein is 5g. No sodium, no cholesterol, 240mg of potassium. Ingredients are dates, almonds, and cherries. That's it. It's uncooked, vegan, and kosher. Healthy? Not as a substitute for lunch on a daily basis and not if you can't have any sugar in your diet, but much better than a candy bar or a cookie, and quite good if your diet is generally balanced. In fact, I think they're an excellent snack from both a taste and a nutritional perspective. The apple pie flavor is also excellent. My wife doesn't much care for the chocolate coconut chew, but I like it quite a lot, and I'm a chocolate snob. Oh, and this is important - my kids like them. My son comes over to my office after school, and he always used to want something from my candy bowl. I now keep that bowl full of almonds and pecans, but he likes these bars so much that he hasn't complained about the disappearing candy

i enjoy my sweets, and the haribo gummi gold bears are no exception.  while many gummy bears are much too sweet and taste incredibly artificial, haribo gummi gold bears are the perfect little dessert or snack at any point during the day, as they are light, and they taste more natural than other gummy bears.

What excellent sardines these are!  They are not packed in soybean oil, but in pure olive oil, so they are HEART HEALTHY.  Even though the oil is not first-pressed ("virgin"), it matters little because it is infused with the flavor of the sardines.  Eating sardines is good for you because the skeletons contain TONS of calcium, which is necessary for healthy bones.  If all of those little old hunch-backed ladies had eaten a tin of these every day, their spines would be as healthy as any young whippersnapper's.

I love to take a couple of cans of these with me when I go fishing--they go great with Ritz crackers just as well as with saltines.  Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night craving a sardine, and these really scratch that itch.

The leftover oil makes a wonderful conditioner for your hair--just massage it in and leave it overnight.  Your hair will be super-shiny and smell good, too!

I feel good about buying these because Norwegians, in my experience, are quite clean.  The sardines are actually cooked RIGHT IN THE TIN, after it is sealed, so the inside is practically sterile.  (That's why the fish don't decompose in there until after you open it.)

That reminds me:  I cannot give this five stars because sometimes the key is missing and the tin must be opened with a pair of needle-nose pliers because the can opener won't go around the corner as the radius is too tight

We recently discovered we have to eat Gluten Free.  I am thrilled to find this pasta!  I don't know about the others but this one, the spirals are very good!  It does not taste identical to regular pasta...we think it is even better.  One of the things I was going to miss the most was pasta and now I don't have to!!  One note: cook less time than the package says.  It says around 16 minutes.  I kept a close eye on it and at around 9 minutes it was done.  With a sauce or in any recipe, no one will know this is not the real thing!  Gluten is becoming a source of many medical problems, not just celiac disease, but also things like autism in children and fibromyalgia.

I have a severe wheat allergy, which I discovered about 10 years ago. At first, I cut out basically all carbs (which was good for weight loss, but bad on the taste buds!). I tried all kinds of wheat free pasta--most of it was grainy or pasty or just plain gross. This stuff is fantastic! I don't even have to apologize for making "fake" pasta--no one can tell the difference. Plus, it's brown rice, which, I belive, makes it healthier.

Although the package says this is a soup, we prepare it and pour it over white rice for a delicious and easy cuban style side dish. The taste is fresh and the texture creamy. Add some shredded cheese for a satisfying soup high in fiber and calcium.

I work very early (4am) and have a hard time getting to sleep.  I have used the regular Sleepytime tea and it helps me to unwind, so I thought I would give this one a try. . .what a help!  I not only unwind, I fall asleep easily and stay asleep all night without the annoying groggieness the next morning.  Just be sure to sip it at least an hour prior to your usual bedtime.  The only downfall is, I can only find it online.  Wish my local stores would carry it

This was my first taste of agave and I am hooked.  Just a little does the job of several teaspoons of sugar or honey.  It rates low on the glycemic index so doesn't over stimulate the production of insulin.  A much healthier choice than artificial sweeteners, in my opinion

I am hypoglycemic, and so I have had to deprive myself of so many sweet tasting foods over the years.  That was until I recently tried agave nectar.  This stuff tastes great strait out of the bottle, and and also works well in baking, hot chocolate, etc.  The best part is that I don't get any symptoms of hypoglycemia after eating it!  It is truly amazing that this stuff tastes so good without making me feel sick.  I have never liked any of the artificial sweeteners out there on the market, but this stuff is all natural so it is great.  Even my sugar tolerant fiance happily eats it on everthing.  Give it a try

Thes little candies have big flavor. They are different from the usual candies found in the U.S., a fun and interesting Japanese treat. The assortment comes with a variety of flavors. The flavor seems more intense, and even though the packages are small, you feel satisfied with just a little of the candy at a time. I really liked the strawberry and coffee flavors.

Jelly Belly really does have true-to-life flavors! EVERY SINGLE FLAVOR in that box tastes exactly like what it should. A little pamphlet comes inside the Jelly Belly box, which tells you what different jelly beans you can mix to create a certain food. For example, 2 peanut butter jelly beans + 1 jam jelly bean = peanut butter jelly sandwich. It has a lot of fun combinations and surprisingly, they all taste like the foods that they should!

This is really a great gift. Everyone I've given it to can't stop talking about how real these flavors taste, and the kids have lots of fun looking at the pamphlet and mixing the jelly beans to create foods

This tea scores high on all counts--fragrance, flavor and even the name! Making tea with Lotus creates a delicate light green brew which is deliciously scented. The flavor is augmented by the aroma--a light floral flavor with just a hint of the grassines of green tea. The flavor of lotus flower is hard to describe--it has a slight buttery flavor reminiscent of fine jasmine tea.

If you need a strong jolt of flavor this tea is not for you. If you want something unusual, savor the subtlety of this wonderful tea.

Quote from The Book of Tea by Okakura:

"Meanwhile, let us have a sip of tea.  The afternoon glow is brightening the bamboos, the fountains are bubbling with delight, the soughing of pines is heard in our kettle.  Let us dream of evanescence, and linger in the beautiful foolishness of things.

These are funny cream-filled licorice, so flavorful and fun to eat.  My husband loved this same type of candy we found on a trip to Spain years ago and now he can have it all the time!  If you haven't tried it and don't want to commit to 12 bags, check out your local Cost Plus to see if they have it in stock (they do at most of them).  Then come back and order it here- what a deal

This is the best product ever, my son doesn't eat fruit, but he will he these apples.  Much cheaper than the Gerber dried fruit and it even comes by the case!!!  My playgroup mom loves them too and all buy the apples as well as the strawberries, peaches and blueberries.  My son loves the strawberries too!  Great company and Great price!  Enjoy

I never thought I would use freeze-dried apples until someone gave me a can as a gift. In baking pies, cookies and applesauce, these apples are better than the real thing! So much less prep time, it is unbelieveable. The Honeyville product taste very natural as well

I first read about steel cut oats in Men's Health.  After scouring the city searching for them for weeks, I had nearly given up.  Finally I realized I could probably just order them online.  These oats taste great, and you can't beat the price.

This was my first experience with steel cut oats.  I really liked them.  Will buy more. We tried cooking overnight in a crock pot but didn't work with the two crock pots we have - one produced a crust around the oats, the other burned them.  So we opted for stovetop. They take longer to prepare but that wasn't a problem, we just cooked the same as for Old Fashioned Oats and let them set on simmer for 10 minutes, stirred them, added dried strawberries or raisins, simmered another 10 minutes, added a little butter and honey and enjoyed the treat

I bought these oats after my grocery store stopped selling steel cut oats. They are really great and steel cut is far superior to rolled oats. I actually crave oatmeal now. I sometimes cook them in broth with chopped onions and mushrooms. They come out like a creamy risotto

Put in under a Reclette grill or just put it in your oven for 5-10 minutes.  Serve with boiled baby potaotes and cornichons.  You will be melted by the Raclette aroma and your melted velvelty bubbly Raclette.  Experience that you cannot forget!!

These lollipops have a really nice flavor.  My only gripe was there were too many pomegranate pops in the two jars we bought, and it was the least favorite among my children.  All in all, though, I would buy them again.

In my experiences with Indian cuisine from patronizing local restaurants owned and operated by native Indian folks, this is quite comparable and the flavors are very similar.  It's nice to be able to open a package of Indian food to eat with some Basmati rice quickly. Recommended.

Some of the flavors are spicy.

Rooibos is Afrikaans for "red bush." Grown in South Africa's Cederburg Mountains and harvested during the summer, this tea acquires its unique red color as a result of fermentation (in mounds) and oxidization, when it is spread out to dry in the sunlight; naturally it is green.

Rooibos is known for its health benefits stemming from its rich content in vitamins, antioxidants, flavanoids and minerals (inter alia, magnesium, calcium, iron, copper, zinc, potassium, fluoride, manganese and alpha-hydroxy) and has a long tradition of medicinal use among the local Native population; among other things, it is known to help cure asthma, hay fever and other allergies, acne, eczema, colics, indigestion, insomnia, and nervous tension. Containing very few tannins and no caffeine, rooibos has a distinctive aroma and amber color.
 
This tea blends well with various spices and condiments; my favorite mixture is a delicious loose leaf blend sold by my local tea store, which features orange peel, cinnamon, grated coconut, finely minced chili and red pepper. For a more commercial alternative, though, Tazo's Red Bush tea is a great choice as well: a rich, exquisite blend of rooibos, hibiscus, orange peel, rosemary, several lemon ingredients (lemon myrtle, verbena and balm), as well as a number of sweet spices.  Enjoy

Having lived in India for more than 5 years, I can honestly tell you this is as authentic as it gets without being there.  The flavor and smell brings back many fond memories of my travels throughout the region, mainly Kashmir and Dahl Lake.  This is a wonderful product and the ladies who brought it to market should be proud.  If you like a relaxing, sweet tea, I highly recommend this chai.  Follow the directions and you won't be disappointed.  Cheers!

This is by far the best chipotle hot sauce on the market.  We first tried it at a Mexican restaurant, and luckily found it in the grocery store and at mexgrocer.com.  I put in on fish tacos and in chili...  there's a nice zing, it's pretty smoky, not overly hot, but very very flavorful

A little while back, no one had ever heard of chipotle, other than the people who make them.  Then suddenly the dam burst and chipotle came flooding into our land like a spicy tide.  We all love those smokey peppers, and at this point there really isn't anything you can't get with chipotle in it.  Chipotle peanut butter, chipotle caramel corn, chipotle coffee beans... we have been inundated by chipotle.

So you might think that this is just another chipotle hot sauce.  How quaint, you think, a chipotle product that actually seems like it should have chipotle in it.  You look at your friends and you all say "Hey, let's be retro and buy some chipotle hot sauce."  You buy a bottle, take it home, and put some on your microwave burrito while watching Championship Poker on ESPN.

Suddenly your eyes widen, your burrito slips from your hands, and you rise, zombie-like, all thoughts of televised card games forgotten.  For you see, this stuff is much better than "just another chipotle" hot sauce.  If that's what you're looking for, there are plenty out there, usually overpriced and drab.  This stuff is totally different.

The taste sensation is difficult to describe.  It's spicy, very spicy, but the burn is coated with a sweet smokey flavor that makes you eat far too much of it before you realize your throat has burst into flames.  And I say sweet because I mean it.  It's sweet, like chipotle honey, not bitter as many hot sauces based in vinegar (which is great too, just different) are.

And by gum, it's good on microwave burritos.  You don't have to live in shame.  Pour it on.  If you can find it in a store, it's cheap too.  What more can you ask for?  Buy it now!  Do it

If you're doing a low-carb diet or looking for snack foods that won't trigger a glycemic reaction, try these amazing cheese snacks.  They are very delicate and pastry-like, crumbling in your mouth. Very savory -- no sweetness. Aunt Lizzie is on to something, and these are a no-compromise low-carb snack

First off, top notch customer service- there's a personal touch that's rarely seen in on-line purchasing!  Please keep it up!

Now for the goods: These vanilla beans are a fantastic value.  Seriously, I wasn't expecting much- I was hopeful given the other reviews- but I've learned some hard lessons to not expect such high standards of quality- especially when it comes to gourmand items-  These beans are even superior to those I can get from my local provider (at three times the cost, mind you.)  I've even ordered online from two other sources (one recommended by Martha Stewart, lol)- and these beans are plumper and more supple than those other pricier providers.  (Plump and supple- always a good thing.)

If you're on the fence- I urge you to go for it.  You owe it to your recipes to use quality indredients.  You will not be disappointed.  I know I'm not.

Thank you kindly

In response to those who say this is no different than typical artificial vanilla, Molina Vanilla actually contains both real Mexican vanilla and artificial vanillin. It's much different than the stuff you'd buy in the supermarket. If you don't believe me, do a side by side taste test. You'll immediately notice that the Molina vanilla is much more aromatic, with a fuller range of flavor.  Personally I prefer Molina vanilla over both artificial vanilla and even the typical pure Madagascar vanilla.  I would recommend it to anyone

I've been drinking this coffee for over 2 years and, in my opinion, it is the BEST!  I roasted my own beans for 9 years and when I decided to buy roasted beans (my roaster died) I searched and searched for a blend close to my own.  This was it!  I love the subtle chocolate overtones and the brilliant aftertaste that lasts for a quite a few seconds.  The acidity is perfect, for me.  The balance is perfect, for me and I don't feel Starbuck's has compromised this particular coffee one bit.

This NOT a flavored coffee, May 12, 2006
Reviewer: Karen S. Torvik "kstme" (Las Vegas) - See all my reviews
     
I took exception to the reviewer who said this was a flavored coffee. It is NOT! Since his synopsis appears to be directed at me, I felt he needed to be straightened out on this. It is a 'breakfast BLEND' with NO flavored coffees, AT ALL! The chocolate overtones COME FROM the BEANS! If the coffee had been tasted, this would have been understood. I still consider Seattle's Best Breakfast Blend to be one of their very best coffee blends.

Seattle's Best Breakfast blend  is absolutely one of the best coffee blends out their. Some years ago I lived just across the sound from Seattle and fell in love with Seattle's Best Brand. I was slightly disappointed to find that they had been bought out by Starbuck's and worried that SB would ruin the brand. I have been delighted to find just the opposite. SB has seen fit to leave the brand in tact and at the same time made the brand more accessible.  This is a rich and full bodied coffee that goes wonderfully with just a touch of cinnamon

I get these at my local Asian food market. I can't stop. There's 70% of the recommended daily allowance of sodium in each package, but they're SOOO yummy... I've tried to duplicate the seasoning on my own, but like Dr. Frankenstein, I usually create a monster that pales in comparison to the God-like entity I'm trying to mimic. I pay $2.49 ea. in Athens, OH... so I have to think they'd be cheaper in big cities. I've seen these dank noodles for as much as $5 + shipping online. There's a product called UFO that's very similar and even worse for you, but it's only 99% as good as this noodly nectar of the gods. Man, this stuff is better than the best crack cocaine. I'm tellin' ya. I'm finnin' ta go fix myself a bowl RIGHT NOW!

 I personally enjoy it without the mustard/mayo pack but I just love this stuff. Worth every penny of the price, makes a great and easy meal, and... if you're Catholic and observe the "no meat on Fridays"... this has no meat in it, not even flavoring! So it's an absolutely awesome alternative to the usual Friday fare. A little spicy, but great! ... I just can't handle the mayo... something about spicy and creamy just don't mix for me

Every single morning I drink one can of Red Bull!! I suffer from chronic fatigue and Red Bull is no miracle drink but it does give me the boost that I need. No other energy drink has come close to giving me a boost but Red Bull. I have tried Sobe and Monster which are okay drinks but they do not give me energy in the least! I love the taste of Red Bull, the taste is addicting and many people that I have talked to also agree! The price is steep but I wouldn't go without it. The cheapest price that I have found it is at Walmart for $6.99 for 4. At most gas stations red bull is $7.99 for 4 and averages to $2.00 a can not including tax. If you drink a lot like I do the money adds up quickly!! I pay on average about $48.00 a month on Red Bull not including tax, but If I did not go to walmart I would pay about $10 more a month. Red Bull has helped me so much and I am happy to find a energy drink that tastes very good and that works very well!!

I started drinking a can of Red Bull Energy Drink every morning when I was working outdoors doing strenuous physical labor. I found that at the end of the day, I was no longer exhausted, but felt fit, active, and invigorated. I was amazed at the effectiveness of the energy drink! After drinking a can, I didn't feel any different (it wasn't an instant buzz) - it didn't affect the way I felt at all - though I found that I just had more energy at the end of the day - and I didn't get tired at all during the day like I normally would. 

The raspberry flavor of the drink is pleasant - a bit on the sweet side. I highly recommend this product to anyone doing physical labor, or anyone who needs a mild pick-me-up to increase productivity during the day. 

One small word of warning - Beware - this stuff is toxic mixed with alcohol. You'll have one heck of a hangover the next day. As alcohol is a Downer, and Red Bull is an Upper, the effects of alcohol (at the time of drinking) appear to neutralise. You don't realise how drunk you actually are (until the next day when someone pulls out the video tape and shows a movie of you dancing naked on the tabletop at your grandmas birthday celebration...youch!

Crunchies are the absolute best candy bars.  Why they are not sold in the US is very puzzling to me.  With all the crap candy bars here in the states, it seems like Crunchie Bars would 'clean up'.  I'd never buy any other candy, except maybe Jaffas, another Cadbury product not sold in the US (I buy them in New Zealand).  Hey Cadbury, wake up, hellllooooooooooo  Are you there?  Anybody home???????????????  Please sell us your good candy here in the US, OK?

If you love mac and cheese, this is a great way to satisfy that craving quickly over making it yourself.  Quite frankly, when I was young, I preferred this over homemade!  I still do too!  I don't know if it's the processed, dehydrated cheese taste that they include or if it just has a ton of cheese flavor that makes it work, but it certainly does.  Kids just love the stuff and usually go for it over the homemade as well.  Can't recommend it enough

If you love garlic, you will LOVE this product. We have been using it for a couple of years now and it is the most used seasoning in our kitchen. It is great on all meats, garlic breads, casseroles, pasta dishes, and just about anything else you can think of. You won't be sorry you bought this product

This really is a sweet mortar and pestle, especially for the price!  It works wonderfully well and looks so neat just sitting there in our kitchen.  We looked all over our city and could not find what we wanted.  We finally resorted to an online search at Amazon and, of course, found plenty of choices.  We settled on this one though there were many more exotic ones available.  Great choice by us!  Also, we bought the set from The CMC Company and were well satisfied

The first time I had purchased a box of Pamela's Lemon Shortbread cookies, they sat on the shelf because I wanted to use them in another recipe and didn't think they'd taste all that great alone. Well I was Wrong! I opened the box one day to use them for a cheesecake crust and decided to try one. It was so good. The texture wasn't anything like I expected- it was not dry and crumbly, it was thick and had a nice texture. The taste was lemony delicious! I was very pleased with them. I had cookies and milk for a snack the next day and was delighted at how refreshing it was. They also make a wonderful crust for lemony cheesecake and a bit sprinkled on top for an added touch.
These are the best lemon Shortbread cookies I've ever had. I now have about 4 boxes left in the pantry. Not your typical sandy textured, bean flavored Gluten Free snack/ dessert-- this one is awesome!

I never heard of fondant until watching some sort of cake comnpetetion while flipping through the channels. After using fondant compared to normal frosting to make decorations, I have to say fondant is much easier to use because of it's texture. I have yet to cover a cake with it, since frosting does a good job for a lot less money - so I suppose it would do well there too

This is the same Cadbury bar you can find in local supermarkets & drug stores.
Even tho it may say Hersheys Disp. on back, it's still the Cadbury Chocolate inside.
Hershey only leases out the right to mfg and dispribute. Same Cadbury you would 
buy in the UK. Most excellent chocolate.

It was great to be able to purchase Bird's Custard Power-Traditional as my Mother is English and we (the entire family) enjoy Bird's Custard with many different desserts.  It is impossible to find the Traditional Custard Power in Colorado.  A 600g container will last about 8 months as we do not eat much of it in the summer months.

Re: the cookie, it's full bodied, and very flavorful. I was suprised that I liked the vanilla as much as the chocolate, very unusual for me. I'll be back for more!

My order arrived in perfect condition, within 7 days! All the Stella Doro products I ordered were crisp  and easily breakable, but they had carefully bubble wrapped everything!

Gebhardt's Chili Powder ah, I have been searching for a long time to find it again.  It is the best, most perfect, a complex and interesting aroma, flavor a bit of sweetness, a back-of-the-mouth herbiness, forget hot ones - you can always add heat, but seldom does one encounter a flavor so amazing.  Great used in the usual ways, but also a pinch added to fudge or chocolate icing, or to peanut butter cookies!  Mixed with some lime juice as a dip for crisp toast, lightly sprinkled inside a trout..

Try this and I am sure you will like the flovor.

My Family are all from Texas.  Since I was a wee little tyke (60 years ago) I remember my Grandmother, Effie, cooking with Gebhardt's chili powder.  Nothing else would do and since Effie (who was known to all as Grannie) taught my Mom how to cook; Gebhardt's is the only chili powder any of us would every use.  

Okay, okay, so I did try to cut costs sometimes when I was younger and bought the grocery store chili powders but the taste was definitely not the same and it seemed things cooked with that mess were not edible either.  

I wish they would sell Gebhardt's in a bigger bottle because I usually have 3 or 4 bottles in my cupboard and I am scared of running out when I am in the middle of cooking something great like red beans and rice, or Grannie's mexican skillet, tamale pie, chili, red eye stew,  stuffed peppes, omlette mexican, on and on.  

Grannie's Goulash

Cook 1 1/2 cups long grain rice (I used Texmati you will end up with about 3 cups rice)

note:  I am a vegetarian so I do not use bacon grease anymore but it is really good with bacon grease instead of vegetable oil.

In a large skillet Brown 1 pound ground meat in some 
4 tablspoons olive oil or corn oil when it starts getting almost browned, 
add 1 large chopped onion, 
2 or 3 cloves garlic chopped, and 
1 large or two smal bell peppers in about 1/2 inch cubes (can add some chopped big hunks of two ribs celery)(can use red bell peppers also). 

Cook until onions are sweated and garlic as well. On low heat - Add about 4 tablespoons of Gebhardt's Chili Powder (at least I use more) and if you have some ground cumin put a spoon of that in too. Stir it around so the chili powder has a good absorption of oil, salt and pepper to taste.

YOu can add a packet of Sauzon achiote & cilantro or a packet of Azrafan but it's not really necessary because the disk takes its main flavor from the Gebhardt's

If you can get hold of a can of Rotel tomatoes (drain most of the water off), or  you can add about 1.5 cups tomato sauce, or chopped tomatoes, or even thick tomato juice, and salsa works good too.  

Add 1.5 cups whole kernel corn (I use frozen) you can put in a can of Mexicorn and it looks good too.

1 Cup kidney or pinto beans from the can or that you have made.

Stir this around and simmer on low heat until heated through.

When it is all heated put in 1.5 cups to 2 cups of rice heat and toss well but lightly so as not to mush the rice.

I serve this with grated cheese on top but you can put cilantro, chopped tomato, sliced olives, avacado and even a plop of sour cream.  One dish meal easy clean up leftovers are great next day in an omlette or on a tortilla.

This recipe is very fogiving and so you can pretty much use what you have on hand. Grannie Effie had 6 children and fed most of the neighborhood during the drepression

****
Tazo's Passion Herbal Infusion is a somewhat tart, deep, flavorful (hibiscus-y tasting) tea. It is not berry-like in taste, although it is red in color. It's difficult to describe what hibiscus tastes like, but I find it a most pleasant taste. My husband says it tastes like pomegranate to him. Although Passion contains licorice root it is not sweet. 

The ingredients in Passion are: hibiscus flowers, natural tropical flavors, citric acid, orange peel, licorice root, cinnamon bark, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy. It is caffeine-free!

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.

On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "A tantalizing deep red tea made from hibiscus flowers, exotic herbs and natural tropical flavors." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Passion as "berry, juicy, wine-like, merlot, sweet, earthy, dense". Tazo describes the aroma as "sweet, juicy, red fruits". 

I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Passion gets only four stars.

The deep purple/red color and hibiscus fragrance is enough to make anyone passionate about tea. Yet, is this really tea? It looks like tea, but it is really an herbal infusion made by steeping hibiscus flowers, orange peel, licorice, cinnamon, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy in a swirling of hot water. 

The flavor is slightly reminiscent of hot apple cider or hot cranberry juice. This tea leaves a tingle on your tongue and I think it goes very well with a spoonful of honey. 

I love Tazo Teas and have been immersing myself in the mysterious experience with a sense of abandon. So far I've tried most of the flavors and have always been impressed. 

I do think you need two tea bags for each cup of tea to fully intoxicate the senses and experience the magic of the ingredients. Caffeine Free. 

You can drink this as you type into the night...

I have consumed two bags of this green tea.  It is an excellent quality tea, balanced in flavor and balanced in terms of the sense of well-being it imparts to the imbiber.  It helps me to concentrate better and helps to even out my moods.  It feels like a good detoxifier to take after eating a meal with a lot of saturated fats or meat, partly because of its anti-inflammatory effects.  It has less caffeine than regular tea or coffee.  Just enough caffeine to give a slight elevation of mood, but not enough to cause one to hyper-concentrate and feel mood swings.  Of course, this tea consists of loose leaves and twigs, and not tea bags.  This is an important concept.  In a typical supermarket, the tea comes in bags and has too much caffeine and is overly processed, which reduces its nutritional value dramatically.  In general, green tea bought from a popular brand in a supermarket does not contribute to the reputation for health that green tea has.  This kind of green tea that is in the natural form is the only kind that does.  I brew it by microwaving water to boiling, then letting the water cool for a couple minutes while stirring it with a spoon to agitate out any oxygen dissolved in the water.  Then put a heaping teaspoon of the tea in it and let it sit for 3-4 minutes.  Very hot but not boiling water is the key.  You will likely find that consuming natural forms of green tea like this one, raw and unroasted, is far superior to drinking most popular brands of tea from the supermarket, or to drinking coffee

I ordered several Tasty Bite items and they were all great, and very convenient to take to work since they do not need refridgeration.  The eggplant in particular was delicious, just a hint of spice.  However, it does not come with rice, which helps make it a more filling meal
