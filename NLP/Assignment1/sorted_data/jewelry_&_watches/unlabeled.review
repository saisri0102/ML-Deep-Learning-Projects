I love knowing the exact time (even if my mom thinks I am crazy), and it works like a... clock! I never have issues with the updates (in Illinois), but I do have a few minor issues: the watch is too thick (5/8 inch), the band is made for a gorilla and is very difficult to adjust for a human, the buttons are hard to press, and the manual is too small and hard to read. Still, if I had a choice between this watch or my borhter's Rolex, I will take his Rolex and exchange it for 40 Casios. Thank you, Casio

I've owned several watches, including the older G-Shock and the Casio Men's G-Shock Atomic Solar Watch # GW1400DA-9AV (among others).

First, there are so many G-shock models to choose from. You could have bought the # GW1400DA-9AV (the stainless steel model) for the same price ($75) during the week of July 24, 2006.

This watch simply has everything one ever needs for time functionality: solar power (no need for daily rewinding, kinetic body movement, or batteries), synch with the atomic clock in Colorado (ultimate accuracy), time zone adjustment (ease for jet setters), light button (which also goes off when you tilt your wrist), stop watch functionalities, day/date functionalities, and countless other time-related functions. In this respect, it's much more functional than a Patek (even the complicated wrist watch models, or the more mundane Rolex, etc.). Of course, it's a lowly Casio, costing a mere $75 (vs. $75,000 for a low end complicated Patek)

Buyers should be aware that the watch is purtty bulky, probably 5/8 to 3/4 in. thick. One needs a sporty forearm/wrist to go with this watch.

For the fun of wearing it couple times a year, the price, and just to look at it as part of a collection of watches, I'd highly recommend it.

I live in eastern Pennsylvania, about 1600 - 1700 miles away from the atomic time signal station and this watch syncs fine right on my bureau, 4 feet from a window, and in a watch case.
When I received the watch, the battery indicator was on Medium, after about 30 minutes or less on a sunny windowsill, it achieved Full charge.
I'm quite pleased with it

This watch just absolutely filled the wish for my 4 year old grandchild!  She is unable to tell time yet, but she wanted a "Princess Watch"  to help her learn, and she was thrilled when she received it.  My daughter told me it was pretty and soft looking.  I insisted that the watch be one with hands, not digital.  So we all were happy and satisfied!  Ina Lan

Elegant yet tough, this particular Casio has a metal bracelet and is extremely comfortable to wear.  The display is sharp, clear, and very easy to read.  I only wish it had a thermometer.  The watch is big and looks very macho on your wrist

I wear this watch every day and I usually work outside. I am very pleased with the features and the durability. It seemed daunting to work the features at forst, but a short time with the instruction book made them accessable and easy.

I have only two complaints: One is that the metal band has developed a slight "squeak" when I move my wrist sometimes. The tin man needs oil. The second is that despite being placed by a huge window every night, the watch does not always get the time signal from Ft. Collins. I have gone as long as several days without getting it - but when you consider that most watches do not get it at all, I am OK with the spotty reception

I love this watch.  It has radio controlled time so it gives you exact time automatically.  Easy to read numerials. Watch is attactive.  The only down side is that it is a little bit on the heavy side.

The watch is solar powered and time is synchronized with an Atomic clock.  I'm not sure how that works (radio waves?) but the watch is extremely accurate.  The watch charges easily - put it under a light when you take it off- and it has a powersaving feature that kicks in when there is no light source (i.e. it's dark).  The buttons/settings work similarly to a battery powered G-shock but there is a little more complexity because you have to set your home city for the atomic clock sync to work right.  It's the first Casio I've owned with a metal band.  Unless you're a gorilla, You'll need to remove some links from the watch band.  I did this myself but you may want to take it to a jewelry store cause they have the right tools.  I love the watch.  It is everything you would expect from a G-Shock

You'll most likely have to get the links adjusted
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
The strap/links on these G-Shocks are quite oversized: when I first got it, I could fit the watch around my legs! (You'll most likely have to get the links adjusted). Ironically, the four side buttons on the watch is small. So even if you have a huge wrist, you'll probably have trouble pressing the buttons! (Not for huge fingers) 

***BEWARE*** the picture shows the four side buttons on the watch in silver, but the left and right side buttons on this model is actually plain black! It is quite misleading! The silver side button is actually the MTG920DJ model (which is the 2005 version). According to Casio, the MTG920DA was actually released in 2004 with black side buttons. If you search the Casio website, it will only display the MTG920DJ (their most recent version); most websites that still sell the MTG920DA are just taking the latest MTG920DJ version picture from Casio's website. The MTG920DJ seems to have the same features as this one (MTG920DA), except the four side (left and right) buttons are in silver. 

For those of you wondering about the three circles on the watch: 
the first one on the very left is basically a wannabe-analog display - basically, every five minutes, a bar increases (or decreases when it gets full); it's just mostly there for cosmetic reasons. 

The second one in the middle is the battery status; it has an L (Low), M (Medium), and H (High) and the bar would display in one of those areas. If you get out in the sun a lot or know an area in your home where the sun shines a lot, then you won't have a problem with the battery ever going below High. Moreover, it has a power saving feature; the watch will go into sleep mode (display off) when it is in a completely dark area for a long time. 

Finally, the third circle on the very right is where it tells you what options are enabled/disabled. It shows SPL (split time for stopwatch), DST (Daylight Saving Time), SIG (Hourly Signal), ALM (Alarm), SNZ (Snooze), and Auto EL (Automatic Electro-Luminescent backlight - the backlight turns on by tilting it a certain degree towards your face without having to manually press the backlight button.) 

Keep in mind, synchronizing with the atomic signal is not instant: it usually takes around 3 minutes (at least for me, I live in California.) And if you're in a busy area or near an electronic, it might be difficult; try again or move to a different area. Moreover, it should show you the strength/level (4 levels) of the signal (while you're synchronizing) with a satellite icon on the watch. There is also a feature that automatically synchornizes for you while you're sleeping at 2:00AM, 3:00AM, 4:00AM, and 5:00AM. Therefore, it's not always necessary to syncronize it yourself because by the time you wake up, it should be ready to go. 

Overall, this watch is attractive and fun to wear. The atomic radio signal feature is very cool; having the official time is great - right to the precise second! I've had this watch for months now, and I enjoy wearing it daily. 

This watch does have a lot of feature - except, it's a pity it does ***NOT*** have a countdown timer! 

Pros: 
- Cool design 
- Water/scratch resistant; G-Shock are known for their toughest watches. (Update: I've worn this watch daily for almost a year and a half now and not a single scratch - still looks brand new!)
- Solar Power; battery life is excellent; never had the power ever go below High. Power Saving Feature. 
- Position of the time and date is easy to read at one glance. 
- Metal strap 
- Can display World Time with Local Time 

Cons: 
- The side buttons are small and tight to press (must use like the very tip of the fingers) 
- Atomic signal takes too long manually, and it usually is not possible to synchronize while wearing the watch; if you're inside the home, it is usually best to take off the watch and leave it near a window. 
- Alarm beep can be a little longer perhaps (even my inexpensive Timex Watch would beep and it would gradually beep faster, which I actually like a bit better.) 
- No countdown timer. (How could they forget this?!) 

Also, try to research other models instead of finding out the hard way (like I did about the side buttons) before purchasing.

The style of the watch is great because my husband can go from office, to yardwork, to golfing, to a night out without ever changing his watch! He absolutely loves his watch!

When I ordered these, I was a little nervous.  However, once I recieved them I was rather impressed!  These are perfect for small ears and I love how the backs of the earrings are screw-ons and they do not dig into the ear or behind the ear (which is a problem I run into with my daughter who is 5).  She loves these earrings!  The picture on Amazon is horrible, these are quite pretty and nice.  I would definately order more!

This was a pity gift to myself because it was my anniversary, and I've just had nose surgery.  Like other reviewers, I was also surprised at the quality of these earrings.  I try to look for bargains on Amazon to make my shopping dollars go as far as possible, and these seemed to be a good deal at $24.99 when regular price was $75.  Just since March 16, though, both retail and selling prices have changed on Amazon to be $34.99 and $70.  It's very true that the posts are a little thicker than normal, but not onerously so; the result is that the hoop is not going to slide around on your ear, and the post clicks securely into the catch on the other side.  The earrings are larger than I expected for the price, which is good, but they are not too big.  Nickel size is about right, and they feel as if they have some weight to them

I think the title says it all!  The posts are fine and I don't feel that they are too thick at all.  These earrings are comfortable and elegant.  In response to the two negative reviews based on the size of the hoops, I would recommend that all intelligent buyers READ the dimensions in order to avoid disappointment.  I can't believe that people would negatively rate an item because they were ignorant and failed to read the description.  The description is very accurate and I am very happy with these earrings.  You won't be disappointed with the quality of these earrings

I bought these to replace my boyfriend's favorite earrings (he lost one).  I had to return them because they were a little bigger than the one's he had and they looked a bit "metro".  Overall, though, they were of excellent quality and I wish it had worked out

I ordered this necklace for my 6 year-old daughter who misses me at school. I told her to touch the necklace whenever she felt lonely as it will remind her of my love :-) It is a high-quality necklace. It is tailored (in size and scale) for girls but it reminds me of some of my own jewelry in terms of design and finish. This line would make a great "first" Real necklace for your blossoming young lady

Just keep in mind it's mainly only used for getting the pins out to the point where you can work with them using a good set of pliers. Saved me quite a bit of time and money spent going to a jeweler for sizing several watches as I gain and lose weight. Has worked every time for me...

As the last reviewer said, look for directional arrows on the band showing which way the pins should travel, both on the way out and on the way in.

The maximum band width that will fit in the tool is 15/16". People have complained about the limitation, but haven't posted exactly how wide a band this tool will work with. If you're handy, this plastic tool could be cut or ground to accept wider bands.

Do a search for a place called Widget Supply that sells this tool for a little less and also includes 5 extra pins. They shipped mine very quickly

I loved this item because for less than the price of getting one link taken out of one of my watches i could take out as many as i wanted from all of my watches and save so much more money on doing a simple task. I think anyone who is wanting to remove links from their watch should invest in this product before they go to a jewelers and pay to have it done

The link remover worked as advertised. It took approximately 10 minutes to remove links and put band back together on a Fossil watch. Care needs to be taken to make sure you have aligned the pin with the bracelet properly. Don't try to force it. When you have it aligned properly you'll see the pin slide out

This is a hefty watch, large super polished bracelet. The dial is brilliant red. I can see why one reviewer complained over finger-prints. lol
My only discerns were: Does not say who makes movement. The crown is difficult to use. Be careful when sizing as pin is a split spring. Changing time requires sweep hand be at the 12:00 position. Seems to keep good time. It is gorgeous. 10 year warranty has a $10.00 catch

It was shipped promptly, and did not take long to arrive. 
I was more than satisfied with the way the order was handled.
My Dad seems to like the watch a great deal, so all in all, 
you can count me as a happy customer

Atomic watches are highly-accurate quartz watches which are synchronized each day with a time signal broadcast in the U.S. from the definitive U.S. Atomic Clock in Ft. Collins, Colorado. Thus, all atomic watches are always accurate to within a fraction of a second at any time. Since atomic watches adjust automaticaly to and from daylight saving time they are convenient as well as highly accurate. Casio makes -- and Amazon sells -- a wide selection of styles of atomic watches to suit various needs and tastes, including G-Shock watches for extra ruggedness and solar-powered watches which never need replacement batteries. But all atomic watches, including this budget-priced Waveceptor model, are equally accurate to a fraction of a second at all times. If you want an attractive watch that is always accurate and do not need other special features, this model is a real bargain

I was looking for a money clip that was thin and light.  I wanted a hinge so that I didn't have to bend it every time the thickness of my wad of cash changed by a significant percentage.  I dislike gaudiness as much as cheesy or cheap appearance.  

This money clip meets and exceeds all I asked for, except it looks a bit on the cheap, as others have commented.  It also scratches easily, but I knew about this prior to purchase decision since I've owned other titanium products.  

I would have given this a solid 5 stars if the manufacturer made it wider using a thicker material and rounded the corners evenly, but I'm not sure if I would have paid a higher price.  

For those of you who are using your finger nails to open the hinge, I recommend that you hold on to the bills to open the hinge.  You will have leverage to open it easily without risking a cut.  Yes, it's that sharp.

I bought this as a gift for my fiance.  He hates bulky things in his front pockets, but this is something he can use and forgets it's there.  He left it in his pocket and it went through the wash.  Everything he had clipped in it, credit cards and cash, were all still clipped together after a full wash cycle

Several years ago, I was given one of those so-called front pocket wallets as a gift.  It had a clip with the exact same mechanism as this clip riveted to it.  I loved the clip, didn't like the wallet. Too bulky for my front pocket.  So I ripped the clip off the wallet. I loved that clip until it broke after about 4 years of everyday use.

Anyway, in searching for a replacement I found that I could spend around 20 bucks for another front pocket wallet and rip the clip off of it again or I could spend around 20 bucks for this clip.

I love this clip. 
Its extremely lightweight, strong and durable. It keeps my cash neatly organized and doesn't pull my pants down.
My only complaint is that the corners are a tad pointy.  The manufacturer would do well to soften them a bit

I purchased these earrings and can't find anything bigger to compare them to for the price. The backs stay on great and will not get caught on carpet/blankets that could catch and pull the backs off. I have bought several pairs and nothing compares. I would recommend these earrings for any young child

I purchased these earrings as a first birthday gift for my daughter. We printed out the page and went to the local Fred Meyer Jewelers in the mall to see the earrings first hand before we purchased. We absolutely LOVED the earrings, however they were full price, so decided to save $80 and purchase them online. They arrived within two days of ordering, but when we opened the box, the diamonds were yellow, not clear and sparkly as pictured on the site, or at the mall. Still lovely, and a good price, but I think thast these are seconds or lower quality than the earrings one can purchase at the physical store

I'm one of those people that doesn't like to have to rack my brain to figure out what time it is and so I pride myself on buying digital watches.  This watch is great is you're going for a sleek design combined with a trendy look. Plus, this particular combination isn't one that is seen often so you'll be sure to be a one of a kind. I get compliments all the time on how much people like my watch

It was the only friendship ying yang necklace I could find anywhere.  It was perfect, exactly what I envisioned.  Fast shipping.  Shipping was a bit expensive, though, considering the price of the item, but because the item itself was reasonably priced, I got over it.  The other problem I had with shipping, and I don't know if it was the merchant, or Amazon, is that it indicated that the number of days for standard shipping would get it to me well before Christmas, but when I clicked on standard shipping it gave me a notice that I WOULDN'T get it before Christmas and I HAD to choose expedited in order to get it by Christmas.  That did not make me happy.

The necklace is not coloured (i.e. black/white), but aged(yin) and smooth(yang). I would have liked it to be coloured, as this is what is displayed. If this is not what you get, I suggest the picture be updated. However, other than this I was overall satisfied and will cosider ordering other items. The price was extremely satisfying, considering the time and effort I put forth trying to find a pendant like this one. Next time I will make it a point to find out more about the product before I order

These little earrings were exactly what I wanted for work (to wear with scrubs and not look gaudy). They are small, but have a nice width, so they are very shiny. I also like the snap-bar closure. They'd make a nice gift for a pre-teen as they are simple but elegant and the snap bar closure makes them easy to put in with little chance of loss

I bought this for my 5 year old grandaughter in memory of her dad who was killed in Iraq. She loved it. The locket is perfect for a young girl, however,the chain that came with it is very fine and difficult to fasten.  I bought a sturdier chain to go with this locket. I am very pleased with this purchase

I got these on sale through Amazon, but even if I were paying Amazon's full price, I would be very happy with the purchase. A great deal for 14kt!  The earrings are just what I wanted, and are quality-made.  That in itself would be nice, but they come in a velvet box that is nestled inside a nice black slip-top box.  The presentation is so great that now I'm thinking of buying my mom some jewelry from Amazon

I am very pleased with this pendant.  The only flaw would be that the individual rings are not attached together.  The chain is looped around them all, which I thought was a little odd.  But I do like it very much and it is a good value for a great price!

I own several waveceptor watches, and it is easy to get addicted to the "to the second all the time" accuracy of these watches. I like the looks of this one, being somewhat more elegant and less geeky than most of the other models. It works as advertized and is an excellent value. About the only thing preventing a 5 star rating is that the band is a bit thick and tough... i.e. not pliable. I hope this means it will also be more long lasting, but time only will tell

Got this for Christmas, for a son who's growing so fast his wrists haven't caught up with his height yet.  Every watch without a buckle just falls off his hands, so the strap was a high priority.  This Casio has an actual leather band (doesn't pinch, doesn't stick, doesn't look tacky) with a very sturdy buckle.  It is also incredibly sturdy and well made, with a dignified stainless steel bezel.  My other priority was to find a self-setting watch with an attractive dial; this one is clear, clean, easy to read, beautifully executed and GLOWS IN THE DARK (all the blue back-lighting in the world won't replace that amazing look of pale, phosphorescent watch hands floating in the darkness).  
***Bonus--don't miss watching the hands spin when it sets itself for the first time.  Absolutely captivated my son--he loves this thing!!

This pendant is very well crafted, and there is an incredible amount of detail that is only hinted at in the image shown here. It's lightweight and the perfect size: big enough to get noticed, but not so large that it's distracting.

The phoenix is the symbol of rebirth and freedom. If you're starting a new career, getting over a bad relationship, moving to a new place...this is the perfect way to celebrate your new path

This product was great.  Exactly what I envisioned.  Fast shipping.  Shipping was a bit expensive, though, considering the price of the item, but because the item itself was reasonably priced, I got over it.  The other problem I had with shipping, and I don't know if it was the merchant, or Amazon, is that it indicated that the number of days for standard shipping would get it to me well before Christmas, but when I clicked on standard shipping it gave me a notice that I WOULDN'T get it before Christmas and I HAD to choose expedited in order to get it by Christmas.  That did not make me happy.

I love these earrings.  They are really beautiful and so shiny that even with my long hair they're noticable.  

If you're interested in the size of the earrings, I would say that they're about the size of a quarter.  Someone mentioned thick posts.  The posts are the thickest I have seen but I like them.  Every other pair of earrings I own have bent posts because I forget to remove them before going to sleep.  Not these.  

The price is fantastic and they come in a nice box.  Perfect affordable gift

I bought this for myself- as a visible reminder while I waited for surgery. Putting it on helped even more during recovery.

It is just the right size- not too heavy, not too thin. Everyone wants a closer look when I have it on.

This item can"t be beat for a price point . It is a nice addition to my silver wardrobe.Only problem I encoured was that it is a bit stiff and hurts my wrist at the time of Putting on and taking off, but I am a plus size lady so that may be part of the reason .This is a really neat item , shiny and attetion getting ..

I recieved this watch as a gift several months ago. The watch is very nice looking, much better looking in person. Mine hasn't had any issues with timekeeping, it's been very accurate. I haven't experienced the problems others have. 

The face of the watch is nearly impossible to scratch. There's been several times where I've accidently rubbed the face against a wall or other surface only to find no damage, much to my surprise. Other watches I've had scratch within the first week. I've had this watch for about 6 months and have no face scratches (although around the face and on the band show many scratches, not nearly as annoying as a scratch right on the face). I'm serious, I like to party and the face is still scratchless. This is very surprising to me.

The chronograph functions are almost entirely useless, but who cares. A stopwatch without fractions of a second is not worth using, but with this watch the features are more for looks, and they look great. I don't find this to be a big deal since I would rather not have digital functions on my watch, they look tacky in my opinion. Also my cell phone has a great stop watch funtion which I use for 12 ounce beer chug time trials making this complaint almost inconsiquential.

The movement of the watch leaves a little to be desired. The japaneese movement is somewhat jumpy. At this price you really can't expect an automatic movement however. This is really the biggest weak point of the watch and if you have a bunch of cash burning a hole in your pocket, maybe you should get a swiss automatic movement watch. This is a somewhat minor issue given almost all watches in this price range use japanees movements no normal person will ever know the difference.

This watch is about the same price as a cheap fossil watch but when you see it in person it feels and looks much more expensive. The fit and finish is much more than you would expect for $115. I find it to be a great value. The box it comes in is so nice you don't want to throw it away, I still have mine. I wear this watch every day I still recieve compliments on it

This is a great looking watch.  It feels solid and works very well.  I have found it to be more than adequate in its accuracy.  

I fully understand that this is not an "investment timepiece" but for now it is around $100, and looks and feels great.  

I strongly recommend this watch

My Invicta Speedway Chronograph S Watch arrived Friday, several days before I anticipated its delivery and, though not highly relevant, I was impressed with the way it had been packed.

I like the watch very much. The bracelet fitted perfectly and the watch took minimal set up time. I read the manual and everything works as I expected it to.

The luminous hands have a lot more glow than previous watches I've owned and the watch looks expensive... which is precisely why I bought it!

It's a bargain at Amazon's $120 price

I'm a sucker for chronograph and if u're like me... then u're probably not going to part with $10K of your money to go for a Rolex Dytona Chronograph.  The Invicta 9211 is as good as it comes in this class

This watch is a very nice timepiece.  The only disappointing thing is that Amazon is selling a watch that they know nothing about.  The watch has a Japanese Chronograph movement, not a swiss-quartz.  And the band does not come with a double-locking deployment buckle like it says, it comes with a double-locking diver buckle.  Overall I am pleased with the watch.  I just hope Amazon can advertise their products a little bit better

These are great! I bought the black one with the lightening bolts for my 6 yr old. I think he wore it for more than a year constantly except to take a bath and for swim class (including at night). The battery died after a little more than a year. Unfortunately, to replace the battery with a water tight seal cost $25. I told him we'd buy a new watch. He chose the spaceship one... then he didn't wear it for 6 months. The other one is still in his drawer. He just started wearing it again... he loves it! I WILL buy one for my second son... probably the green one with the frogs

I bought this as my everyday watch and love it!  I'm very happy with the ultrathin band that lays down nicely on my wrist and doesn't catch at my arm hairs like chain links do.  The only complaint, and this is a very minor one, is that the adjustable band wasn't made for someone who's wrist is as thin as mine- 5.5 inches around.  I think the tightest it'll go is 6 inches.

So far this watch has been accurate with the moon phase. It is very easy to operate and understand. I have only been out a couple of times to fish and it was at times that the watch indicated that the fishing would not be so good and it wasn't, so this feature has been accurate as well. It is also a coll conversation peice

great watch with some surprising features... vibrates instead of beeping on the hour - moon stages based on your lat/longitude and an illumination option activated whenever you turn your wrist as if you were looking at the time....

My boyfriend had an older model of this watch that he wore for work and play for years.  He wore it while fighting forest fires and fishing in the PNW, and it held up great.  I bought this watch for him as a Christmas gift, and he loved it.  It looks great, is comfotable and was reasonably priced.  Hopefully it has the lasting power of his previous one

This watch is great!  Not only does it have distinct features for helping kids learn to tell time, but it also has fun features that they enjoy.  For instance, there is a backlight on this watch that my son likes to play with in the dark.  Also, it fits the smallest wrists.  With this watch, my son learned to tell time in one day.  It has not come off of his wrist since we bought it.  He even wears it in the tub and yes, it is waterproof

Skagen makes this watch very thin and lightweight with an unbeatable affordable price for titanium watches.  The watch is only categorized as a fashion watch because it looks good for its price.  The quality of the clasp is terrible.  I bought this watch for my boyfriend for vday and he said that the clasp keeps on popping off easily.  He does like the watch besides of that factor cause it is light and great for a everyday beater watch

My son bought this for me for my birthday. I love it!! Like so many others have said, if your tired of those bulky boat anchors you'll love this watch. It's so light you'll have to double check to see if you have put it on. It doesn't have all the " bling bling " you see in a lot of watches which is a good thing for me yet it's still very elegant looking. Thin, light weight,nice looking and keeps great time. I can't say enough good things about this great watch. Buy one....you won't be disappointed

I wanted I watch that I could forget I was wearing.  This watch fits the bill.  It is very very light weight, and the band is comfortable.  I've had multiple watches over the course of my life, but this is one that I will put on at the start of the day and only take off at the end of the day, comfortable and light.

It also looks great.  Sophisticated looking, and can be worn in both casual and dress events.  Great everyday watch!  Highly recommended

I have had mine for two days now.  It is what I expected: A lightweight, minimalist, stylish watch.

Mine is quiet, I can hear it ticking only when held tight to my ear.  The clasp takes some getting used to and the instruction could be clearer, but once one gets it figured out it works fine, including adjusting it.  It is somewhat difficult to read in low light, but the hands while small are very reflective so changing the viewing angle a bit will usually bring them into clear view.

After reading several reviews for this watch I have to disagree with the comments about loud ticking noise and the strap not latching. I don't have either of these issues.  The watch is however very difficult to read in dim lighting.
The watch is really unexceptional - it offers good styling at a moderate price and that's about it

Every review I read about this watch is true: it's light, stylish, has a loud ticking noise when off the wrist and can be hard to read in certain lighting.
But overall, I am very pleased with the watch and so is its wearer

I agree with most of the other posters here on the watch's aesthetics-it's a really sleek watch that goes well with casual or more formal clothing.

I'm writing a review mainly to address the "loud clicking" that some people seem to be experiencing.

It's a REALLY quiet watch and I can't hear it in a totally quiet room-EXCEPT when I hold it in a particular position. If you wear your watch on your arm with the face at the back of your hand and then point at the ceiling, it'll sometimes make a clicking noise that can be surprisingly loud. It's an odd position to be in though and it's only in a very particular position, so it doesn't at all detract from my overall impression of this watch.

EDIT: I've spent more time with this watch and I must say it looks awesome with everything from jeans to a suit. Another thing I'd add is that it is only "noisy" when the watch face isn't in contact with anything-e.g. when you have it upside down on your wrist and there's a gap, or when you leave it sideways on a table. In some positions it can actually get quite loud, but I can never maintain one of those long enough to figure out how to replicate it

It's black. It's made of steel with mineral, not plastic glass. Yes, it's heavy, but it seems indestructible. And that's why I really like it. Watch for a man who likes *solid* things

Beautiful watch. It's a little heavy compared to your other watches since its all stainless steel. Has your basic functions including alarm, date, 24h time, and stop watch. It also has a night blue backlight. Its a little bigger then the picture would make it seem

I have to say first I'm not a watch person. If I didn't need to know the time  for work I wouldn't even think about wearing one. That said, I got this to replace a broken Citizen, which was very thin and fairly small. This is much larger, but despite that it's pretty comfortable. Not heavy at all. The large dial is also nice for my aging eyes to read and the glowing hands are great at night. It's also a nice looking watch, dressy enough without being stodgy. If it's as sturdy as other people here have said, I expect I will be wearing it for a long time. I don't understand the problem people have setting the language for the day of the week. I guess it comes down to reading the directions, which are minimal but sufficient to set it up.  A darned nice watch for the money

I have been very pleased with this watch so far, and with my purchase experience through Amazon.  I have had better watch band clasps before, but this one isn't too bad.  It's just a little more prone to catch on things since the back side doesn't lay completely flat

I gave this watch to my son for Christmas.  He loves it. It keeps perfect time and is very stylish. The scrolling tic gets lots of comments. 

The only drawback to this watch is that it is very top heavy, so I would not recommend it to someone who has small wrists

 I've actually had the clip for more like 7yrs, but after about 4-5yrs I started to have a few problems like the pin that holds the clip together would come out. But I would just put it back in. After a while it does start to loosen and that being on both the money clip side and the card side. Just bend things back in shape and things are fine for a good while. I give it five stars because I am hard on thing and if it lasted 7yrs for me and my wife (she carries one also). Then it's more than worth it. All the things the first person complained about I find them a plus. Like cards and money being held. I like that feature. It finally gave up the ghost after 7 faithfull years.

This watch is very attractive, and keeps perfect time - according to my puter and cell phone. I had no problem getting it started out of the box. However, it does'nt have the feel of a more expensive watch, that is, it's quite light-weight....and that may be a positive for many people. Overall, an exceptional value for $30

Casio has always made fine watches and this is no exception. It is very distinctive with it's yellow dial. The watch has the capability of automatically setting the correct time by looking for the signals that come out from Colorado and England. Unfortunately I live in Hawaii and there are no signals that reach here so that feature does not function

These earrings are just what I wanted!  Lightweight.  It's true that when you fasten them, you shouldn't "click" the post down into the clasp, it's better to gently insert the post into the clasp.  I love 'em

I've had this watch for a couple months now.  I have to say I haven't seen a better watch at price ranges up to 10x the cost.  It just works/keeps time extremely well.  It pairs simplicity w/ technical sophistication.  It duels as a dress watch as well as when I'm out in more casual settings.  The only thing that would make it more perfect is that Seiko figures out how to make this a perfect traveler's watch as well (timezone changes).  Then there would be no reason for really ever adjusting this watch... ever

It looks so precious and stylish. Very good price for a watch like this. I thought it's possible to get a refurbished watch for this price, but when I opened the box, I knew it's brand new. Amazon did a great job on the pricing.
The length is a little too long, but I got it fixed in a watch store for 10 bucks

Visually, this watch looks like it cost over $100. It has a depth to the face and shine on the bezel that really looks great. The band is very high quality and the latch works great. However, one day I was doing some work that required me to get a bit "physical" with a cardboard box and after I was done I looked down and the watch had stopped!!! I freaked out and started tapping the face hoping it would revive it. It started working again and I did a time-sync to get it back on schedule that afternoon. No problems since, but it doesn't make me really confident it the watch. But for a cheap formal watch it's just fine. Don't depend on it to keep you alive or anything

I bought the Wave Ceptor with the leather armband as a gift and it was received very well. I then bought the Silvertone for myself and I am very satisfied. If you read the directions carefully you can set the watch to your Home Time Zone and then it will set itself. Considering that there is a tiny radio receiver inside, I would say the watch is not too thick. The minute hand advances every 20 seconds which is interesting.
For the money it is quite a deal even if you have to replace the battery every 2 years. You may purchase batteries on ebay very reasonably and install it yourself if you have the right tools. I just wish there were a similarly priced watch for women

I, too, am disappointed in the misinformation Amazon originally posted in regards to the watch being solar-powered, but even without that feature it's still a great watch.

Now, for those of you who are WHINING about not being able to adjust the metal band on this wonderful watch, it's very easy. If you look at the inside of the band, some of the links have a small arrow stamped on them. Just put a very small screwdriver into one of the holes on the "arrow" side of one of those links and push. Do the same for the next "arrow" link. Remove both pins and the loose link. (Of course, you may have to remove more than one link!) Then connect the band back together and slide one of the pins into the "non-arrow" side to secure it. Make sure the slotted/pinched side of the pin goes in last. Push the pin in slightly to match the other links.

Hope this helps you appreciate this great watch a little more

I was pleasantly suprised when I opened the box and found that this watch looks even better in person.
I own a swiss army watch costing 3 times as much, and find that most watches in this price range feel light and flimsy compared to it. That is until I opened the box to my Fossil, this is a heavy solid feeling watch.
This watch is not for men with skinny wrists.
I liked this watch so much that I looked at other Fossil watches and can't decide witch one I will buy next

I originally wanted to purchase another pair of Celtic earrings, but Holly
informed me a few hours later the pair I chose was out of stock.  She immediately refunded my money.  As soon as I found out the pair I had chosen was not available, I chose these as a second choice.  They are very pretty. Just as described.  Elegant. Simple.  But not cheap looking.
Well worth the price.  They were packaged in a little zip lock bag and
tucked inside a little velvet like pouch.  Fine packaging for me.  They
were shipped securely and quickly.  I am sure my daughter is going to
love them.  I would definately purchase from Silver Insanity again.
Excellent customer service.  Excellent communications

I admit I don't know a whole lot about jewelery, luckily it wasn't a diamond, but using some of the previous reviews helped me to finally decided on this set. My wife really like them, love? I don't suppose but that's what diamonds are for I guess. They have that weight to them that I've been told is important and they look really great on my wife. She's gotten numerous compliments so I guess I must of done good.

These earrings have a very clear, summer sky blue stone. The stones are excellent quality. I sell Fine Jewelry, and I'll tell you, these earrings are set like fine diamonds.  I examined them.  The gold bar is solid, with a slight outward swell(not straight up and down), that allows the drop to be displayed at it's best. The butterfly back is tension set and very secure.  There are no openings in the circles that connect the earring components to the gold bar. Every part of the setting is solid and secure.  Generally, I like deeper blue topaz, but these stones are ideal for the way they are set.  The earrings are classic and elegant. They are light on the ear and comfortable. They're small--3/4 inch drop from the post. They have movement, but not enough to be distracting. Just enough to be noticed--very appropriate for business wear. These are truly classic, quality earrings that can be worn with anything, from jeans to dresswear. The earrings are presented in a midnight blue suede box with an ivory interior encased in a midnight blue gift box. I received these earrings one day after I was notified of shipment.  Thanks again Amazon, I know I can get quality jewelry at a GREAT price from you

This is a very cute pair of earrings for a child.  Customer service was great.  I received these close to Christmas and a stone fell out right away because it wasn't set well.  (The stones are tiny.)  They immediately sent out a new pair so I was able to give them as a Christmas gift

The only thing I dislike about the hoops is that their back side is hollow and you cannot see it on the photos-this makes them very light-weight. Nevertheless, they look very dainty and sophisticated, the "rocks" aren' that sparkly, but with the clarity stated in the description they aren't supposed to be. I like them a lot coz they are perfect for everyday - the reason why I bought them. Be realistic! If you want to get a pair of great quality, nice weight hoops with quality diamonds - shell out at least 1K. 
P.S. These would be great for girls from 5 and up

These are a great pair of earrings for the dollar.  They are perfect small hoops that can be dressed up or dressed down but still elegant.  They are not huge diamond blingy earrings, and if that is what you want then you should choose another pair

I love fossily watches.  My only beef with fossil is that all of their metal watches are heavy like bricks.  The downside with this particular model is the quartz that covers the face.  The cover bows out like a contact lens.  This causes the watch lens to scratch if you lay it down on its face frequently.

If you're careful, this won't be a problem - but it's too late for me. :-

Atomic watches are highly-accurate quartz watches which are synchronized each day with a time signal broadcast in the U.S. from the definitive U.S. Atomic Clock in Ft. Collins, Colorado. Thus, all atomic watches are always accurate to within a fraction of a second at any time. Since atomic watches adjust automaticaly to and from daylight saving time they are convenient as well as highly accurate. Casio makes -- and Amazon sells -- a wide selection of styles of atomic watches to suit various needs and tastes, including G-Shock watches for extra ruggedness and solar-powered watches which never need replacement batteries. But all atomic watches, including this budget-priced Waveceptor model, are equally accurate to a fraction of a second at all times. If you want an attractive watch that is always accurate and do not need other special features, this model is a real bargain.

Very nice watch but... it's much smaller & lighter than I thought it would be. 

I had read that it was smaller than the Seiko Divers, this was a plus since the Seiko's are too large for me. However... this watch could stand to be just a tad bigger.

More pluses... 
The dial markers glows with a blue tint, instead of the green of most watches.
The rubber band is quite comfortable & secure using 2 "hold downs" for the excess length that goes thru the buckle.

Downside...
The Citizen logo is imprinted on the band. This is a bit much in IMO, but I'm sure that it will eventually wear off.

Overall a very nice watch... just not a big diver's watch as one might expect

This same model watch was purchased for me 20-years ago for my 10th birthday and it still keeps 100% accurate time.  The rubberized band tends to were out after about 2-3 years of everyday use.  I would suggest replacing it with a stainless-steel metal band, which can be purchased at any major retailer.  The metal band also adds to the attractiveness of the watch....at least in my opinion.  Overall, a fantastic product !

I bought this clip as a gift for my husband, and both he and I were very pleased with it.  It is a little small, but very attractive and looks even better after having been engraved.  In reference to the previous review, it will not hold a thick "wad" of bills, but it holds a few hundred dollars (in $20s) quite nicely.

Graduated from the original Ironman Flix- the size and illumination of the numbers work much better- functions are all about the same as the older model but easier to navigate.  The only complaint is that the band is a little ornery (some extra notch that secures the band also makes it harder to get off- probably could cut it off) but overall very nice upgrade

I bought this watch when it was on sale a while ago. The face is quite large, measuring 1-5/8" on its outside rim, making it a little too big for people with small wrists. The band, though, has enough holes that it will fit most anyone, though it too is a bit uncomfortable on small wrists. The leather band is fairly thick, but two stays are included to keep the end of the band from flapping.

The watch face is silver with a brushed finish. Many claim that the face "has a lot going on", which is true with four sub-dials, but it keeps with the style of a pilot watch. These subdials show the month, date, moon phase, and day, all with deep red hands on a cocentric-design silver background. The time is easy to read with red-tipped hands and hour ticks. There are additional ticks, five per minute, which seem extraneous and only there for design.

The bezel has a series of numbers allowing for conversion calculations of volume (liters, US gallons, and imperial gallons) and distance (kilometers, nautical miles, and statute miles), which are probably useful if you're a pilot, but not to many others.

The best design feature are the push-button adjustments. While the time is the familiar crown that is pulled and turned, the day, date, and month can all be advanced with a simple push of one of three buttons. This is much easier than having to pull out the tiny crown to just the right tick and then turn.

The watch is also water resistant to 100m but I have never tried it.

On the whole, the watch looks good and keeps with the form of a pilot watch. Due to its leather band, it is more an informal watch, and works best with bigger wrists. A thinner or metal band and slighly more comfortable fit would have been nice

Based on the picture, I thought these earrings might have a little bit more of a "puffed" effect, but they don't - and it's ok! :-)  These are really sweet earrings. They are small ( 1/4 inch east-west and 1/8 inch north-south) but they feel very sturdy, and the screw-clasp is nice! They really show up and reflect the light very well. These would work for either a child/young person or an adult. Definitely recommend these earrings for all-around wear

This little ponies will make a wonderful gift or a great stocking stuffer.  I bought them to go with the "Running Horse Pony Sterling Silver Pendant" which I also purchased at Amazon.  If you have a horse lover that wears pierced earrings, this would be a perfect gift and you can find many other horse related jewelry items on Amazon.com to go with these earring

They are very solidly made.  A few of the backs were slightly bent, but I was able to straighten them.  They are just much larger than I anticipated

This is a very masculine, heavy watch.My Brother in law stated,"that isn't a watch, it's a weapon!" The "Pros":  Good looking, all stainless steel, Crystal is well protected by deep face, lighted dial works well, bracelet is well made with "easy to adjust" band, fairly easy to adjust all functions,keeps time and sets itself very well,solar feature is reliable, "radium" numerals and hands last through the night.  The "Cons": The watch looks and feels heavy, The red hour hand is detrimental at times, the three "windows" at the bottom of the dial are fairly hard to read, the automatic light with a twist of the wrist is a nuisance at night--I switched it off, Alarm hasn't been tried so I can't comment on that.  All in all, I'm delighted with the watch and for the money it's a steal !

I love Casio G-Shock watches. I actually had another one (G2210). It is solid and reliable. I never had problem with it. I saw this GW1400DA on Amazon last week and wow it's absolutely best deal I have ever seen. I placed order and it arrived a week later. I LOVE it! Use my swiss army knife to adjust the steel band. It took me 10 minutes. Yes the watch looks a little bulky, but that's it's style. Some people may not like this design but I do. Being the "toughest watch in the world", it can not be thin

This is really a great watch. I am a firefighter and I need watches that can stand the toughest environments.....I always wear a G-Shock. Having already owned a G-Shock before buying this watch, I know this thing will last me a lifetime. A great thing about this particular watch is that not only does it have the durability of a genuine G-Shock, it also has great looks. I wear this watch on a nice outfit and people think I'm wearing a really expensive watch. Little do they know I only spent less than $100 on it.
    Some of the other cool features of this watch are the auto time setting via the atomic clock and especially the solar power. All my life I dealt with watches that need a battery replacement, and after wearing a watch for a long time and the screws on the back cover become permanently attached to the case, battery replacement becomes a pain in the *$%! This watch on the other hand you never need to worry about batteries.....simply put it by the window sill when it says it needs charging.
    Lastly, I love the light-up feature. No need to fumble with any buttons for the watch to light up to read time in the dark. The watch is smart enough to sense ambient light on its solar cells to know if the light-up feature needs to be activated. So if you are out in the sun and look at your watch, the light doesn't come on. And also, the great feature about the light is also that it never drains the battery. If you happen to drain the battery (which would like never happen unless you've been living in the dark for like a year), simply place the watch under a desk lamp or by the window during the day. The darn thing charges itself if you walk around without the front of the watch being covered.
    I love this watch and have grown ever so confident in Casio and it's life of G-Shock watches. You can never go wrong with this watch

Very nice quality.  Thought the Atomic timekeeping would be more of a gimmick but now I really appreciate as I never need to adjust time.  I like the looks but wife thinks it is too bulky.  I gave it 4 stars because the red hour hand and the small LCD windows are not easy to read at a glance

As other reviewers have said, the instructions that come with the watch are pretty much useless. Also, the watch arrived with a dead battery. When I went to get a new one the person at the watch store was able to set it for me. All in all, not a bad deal for a $99 watch, even with the added expense of a new battery.
My husband is very pleased with it and because it was so affordable, he doesn't have to stress over something happening to it.

Overall very happy. Although I have two beefs: 1) the plastic is extremely stiff and can be uncomfortable; 2) from what I can tell it only holds data from one workout. This said, it works well and is a bargain for the price

After several false starts with other HRMs I found the Imara through "My Amazon". I'm technically inept and this was the only HRM that I could set and use by myself. When I run with a large group there's no problem with "cross talk". Beauty! The back light function helps at night. 

I do like the larger and slanted face of the other Nike products, this one could use that as well. The strap is no bother, just tuck it under the lip of the sports bra.

what a great deal and a fun product. I like it because it doesn't make me hot when I exercise the way a full banded watch would. It is also pretty durable and who cares if it fails! I usually wear two in case one goes nuts. Thanks for the cute product. By the way I am a 60 year old female so it isn't just for kids anymore

These earrings are quite big. I sort of wish I ordered 7.5 mm instead. They are very bright and shiny gold. The quality is much better and cheaper than ball earrings I've seen in department stores. Infact I've seen these style earrings at Mervyn's that didn't look as good for $50.

I purchased the light blue and dark red versions of these earrings. I just love them. I can wear them to work in professional attire, or with jeans on the weekend. I am a 40-something professional, atheletic grandmother. I want to look stylish but not faddish. These earrings are just the style that help me surprise people when they find out I am a "Nana!

As always, Silver Insanity matches gorgeous jewelry with good prices. The garnets were the perfect deep red that i love. These earings were perfect and lighter than expected, I also got the blue topaz version and loved it as well. With their quick shipping on top of everything else, Silver Insanity is my favorite seller

These are nice earrings, but the garnet stones were a bit muddy and did not have any sparkle to them.  The silver is beautiful though - shiny and rich looking.

This ring is awesome. It is well made and amazing how it fits together. My only complaint is that the idea of a puzzle ring is misleading. I thought that all four bands would come totally apart from each other. I was going to keep two rings for myself and give two rings to another person as a representation that we are two pieces, but when we are together we are whole. The problem is the rings are all inter-looped, so in order to do this I am going to have to cut them and solder them together. The other thing was, which is good for someone who doesn't want to worry about it falling apart....is that once I clipped the white band that was holding it together, it didn't fall all apart. I was expecting it to just fall to pieces. I literally had to struggle and pull at it to get it to come apart....in fact I lost patience in getting it apart and had to give it to someone else to pull apart. So as long as you aren't trying to use it like I wanted to, this ring is perfect for you. It doesn't come apart easily and they are all looped together so you can't lose any of the pieces

I got this ring for my girlfriend for her birthday. We both loved it, it is really quite beautiful. Yet we still can't put it back together. It has been apart for about two months now, it's really disappointing. If you're amazing at putting things together, than you'll like it. If you're not, you'll probably still like it, but you might wan to leave it together

Atomic watches are highly-accurate quartz watches which are synchronized each day with a time signal broadcast in the U.S. from the definitive U.S. Atomic Clock in Ft. Collins, Colorado. Thus, all atomic watches are always accurate to within a fraction of a second at any time. Since atomic watches adjust automaticaly to and from daylight saving time they are convenient as well as highly accurate. Casio makes -- and Amazon sells -- a wide selection of styles of atomic watches to suit various needs and tastes, including G-Shock watches for extra ruggedness and solar-powered watches which never need replacement batteries. But all atomic watches, including this Waveceptor model, are equally accurate to a fraction of a second at all times. If you want an attractive watch that is always accurate, this model is a real bargain

This was a gift for my husband. He is pretty picky about what he wears. Watches are one of his passions and his knowledge about them is well beyond mine. I was, therefore, reticent in selecting one, not knowing if it would have been a timepiece he would have purchased. Keeping all that in mind, and after having studied several offerings online, I chose this one. To me, it was very attractive, with some fine bells and whistles. Thankfully, my husband found the watch to his liking and he wears if often.

We received ours yesterday and they are bigger than I expected. Honestyy I didnt expect too much for under $100 but I was blown away at the colour on ours, it was at least a H/I. And clarity is very good as well, no visible inclusions. Well worth the $100

These earrings are adorable.  They're light and comfortable to wear. The size is perfect for me since I only have one hole in each ear. These earrings are neither so small that they will go unnoticed nor are they so big that they will detract attention from the vintage pendants and necklaces I love to wear. Gold ball earrings were the first earrings I had when I was a baby so a bit of nostalgia probably was also involved in my decision to buy these beauties. My sister calls them "old-fashioned" but I think that they are rather "classics." They go with everything. Whether I'm dressing casual or formal, a pair of these earrings is never "too much."

To those who feel the 7mm are too big; they are not.  To those who feel the quality may be marginal; the quality is superior.
I have worn them for several months straight - never removing them and they have fully met my expectations.  I recommend them without reservation

The basic problem with this kit is its most essential piece. The blue plastic link remover does not come with replacement pins. It requires focus to properly align the tool's push pin with the friction-fitted watch band link pin. The novice wll almost certainly bend or snap the push pin at some point. When I called the company for a replacement pin, a representative didn't hesitate to offer it by mail without charge. So, why not include a few in the kit? The kit's long nose pliers are good quality and needed to extract a watch band's dislodged link pin. The tweezers and (six) screwdrivers are useful in some situations, but a small hammer to make flush the replaced link pin is always useful. My kit came with instructions but why not an illustration? The kit's list price of one hundred dollars doesn't add up. A hardware store will sell comparable quality long nose pliers for about ten dollars. Tweezers and a set of jewelry screwdrivers are easily available. The link remover is a specialized tool but it is plastic. At the sale price of $25 this is a fair value, but you will want to ask for a couple of replacement pins with your order

Just purchased the kit, the watch link remover tool has a cheap feel but does the job, the link remover pin was bent, but the plier they included did well to straighten the link remover pin.  The Link remover did work well, but lacked the fine adjustments.  The box was cheap paper and they items are packed in foam with cutouts for each tool.  The pliers has already chewed up the foam cutout meant for the plier.  One thing missing is the watch cover opener, otherwise it is a decent set

My wife enjoys these earrings. They are lightweight and attractive. My only concern is that because they are so lightweight, my wife has found it easy to lose one; it has happened a couple of times. Therefore, I would recommend getting a couple of backing elements (I forget what they are called.) to go with them, or maybe they should be furnished with them. Other than that, they were a welcomed present that my wife enjoys.

The earrings were larger and more substantial than I'd envisioned. Really nice, really a good value.

The two-toned crossover design of these hoops adds more interest and pizzazz to the standard hoop.  The size is just right for me: big enough to show off the twist in the design but not so big that it is overwhelming. I also like the weight: lighter than they appear so that I don't feel like I am carrying a load on my ears. I also happen to like the hinge and snap type closure. Good looking gift box, even if it's just a gift to myself. Why not five stars? - Wish that everything that I want costs at least 10% less

This is a great looking watch and the vendor was very straight forward in fulfilling the purchase (no hassles whatever).  The main difficulty is that the watch is impossible to read in low light/dark conditions.  It has no light and the silver hands against the silver face don't provide enough contrast to read in low light conditions (like a restaurant)

I'm a watch guy. I believe that the only jewelery a man should where besides his wedding ring (if he must) is a watch. I collect them and resell them to pay for my own collection. I bought this watch in blue and was so impressed by the look, it sold me on Invictas! It is absolutely gorgeous and looking at it online does not do it any justice. This watch sells everywhere else, except ebay for close to $125 + shipping. The blue face one goes with more clothing but this one is an eye catcher and if you can pull it off, go for it

When shopping around for a new watch, this model fit the bill perfectly. Analogue face, with additional functions (date, stopwatch, alarm), waterproof, in a perfectly sized case. 

The bonus is the finish - black (very dark grey?) with gold details. I thought all metal cased watches these days are silver or gold with little variation, so it was a nice surprise to find this model.

One slight gotcha - what appears to be the "second" hand on the face is not actually the second hand. It is used for the stopwatch. There is a smaller face (located at 9 o'clock on the main dial) that counts the seconds. A little odd, but not a big deal.

Still very happy with the product. All this and got it half price from Amazon. Nice one

Hey, I've been contemplating buying these hoops for a while, but their new price helped me make a decision. I got them in just 2 days and they are very well-made and the closures are solid, feels like you'll never loose them. They are perfect, not too big, not too small and are light-weight. I also like that they are kind of thickiesh, very noticeable ans shiny. A bargain! Thanks AMAZON

I really liked the 14K Yellow Gold Round Hoop Earrings that I recently ordered from Amazon.com.  They were purchased at a fabulous price and were better quality I thought than the gold hoops that I had paid twice the amount for.  They were very light weight and the gold was a nice quality.  I would purchase these earrings again for myself and for gifts in the future

I absolutely fell in love with these earrings. They look classy and elegant while at the same time you can wear them with casual clothes. They are about an inch and a half wide and length wise to give you a better idea on size. They are so comfortable that I often fall asleep with them on and don't notice they're still on till morning. I know I'll be wearing these for years to come

I bought a pack  of watches for my 14 yr old because he doesnt want to wear his good watch skate boarding.  He gave out a few watches to his skate buddies and the word got out.....everyone is calling and asking where he got it. (he actually kept the PINK one and gave the rest away) So I ordered 2 more packs.  Imagine pleasing a 14 yr old with such a reasonable item. I cant wait for the new order to arrive and neither can he

I actually purchased these in March 2004 and to give some perspective, they are so well made that today they are as good when I first purchased them.  I did beat the current price, but at $19, they are still worth it.  They are on the smaller side, as other reviews have noted, but they are still perfect for young granddaughters and those of us who prefer smaller hoops

My wife is a big fan of Little Mermaid and half jokingly said she wanted an Ariel watch for Christmas.If you want Micky, Minnie, Tinkerbell, Winnie or the 3 princesses, you're in luck - their easy. Ariel, for adults anyway, is darned hard to come by.  This was the ONLY decent Ariel watch I saw. Even then, I had to buy a new band for it as this is a kids watch. As for the watch, it really is a nice looking watch and if you put a "real" band on it, you'd never know it was a kids watch. Anyway, she liked it and I'm a hero

This is my first time purchased at Amazon.  The product I purchased is what I expected.  However, I must say Amazon extremely needs to improve customer service and organizational skill.  The watch I purchased did not include any sale receipt.  There was no warranty information included.  And most of all, no instruction manual came with the watch.  The box for the watch is torn and ripped apart.  This is not to mention I had a defective watch shipped to me before.  Obviously I have overrated Amazon before my purchase.  After this experience, I felt as though I made a purchase on-line through a "mom and pop" business versus a fortune 500 company.  I don't think it would take a rocket scientist to figure out if I will make any future purchase at Amazon

I ordered 2 pair of these earrings on the Friday sale and just received them yesterday and I absolutely loved them!  I actually ordered 2 pair of white and 2 pair of the gold.  I gave a pair of each to my daughter who's 7 yrs old and she put the gold one on right away and hasn't taken them off yet.  I put the white gold one on too and I have't taken them off either.  My other girl who's 4 and doesn't have her ears pierced yet said that she want's to go get her ears pierced on her birthday so she can wear those earrings.

These are the best earrings for the price.  They're definitely great gifts for anyone who has their ears pierced

I bought these, along with the 14K 7mm gold earrings, for my wife and she liked them both very much. 5mm is petite and they really look nice on her. I got them on sale for $9.00, what a bargin for 14K white gold

I bought two pair of these earrings in April 2005 for $10 each, one for me and one for a granddaughter.  Now Amazon is running them for $9 on the Friday sale.  It's not too soon to be thinking about Christmas stocking stuffers.  These would be perfect.  These are real gold, quality earrings.  I love mine and have worn them now for almost two years with no problems, having to be careful about metal allergies.  What are you waiting for

The trick to the earrings is that the crystal has a small gold foil glued to the back.  Light enters the crystal, reflects off the foil and then refracts back out through the crystal and that's what it give them a great sparkle.  They're not as blue as they are in the picture, but still sparkle all different colors.

My girlfriend instantly loved these and wore them for a week straight after getting them.  If you or your intended recipient likes "oooh shiny" and "oooh sparkly" things - these are perfect.  She also says that they're quite comfortable to wear

After reading some of the reviews, I was concerned that the product might not come as described.  However, my package arrived exactly as described in the description.  My tool arrived in a wooden box, with padding and slots to hold all of the inserts.  The tool comes with more sets of inserts than I expected, also.  There aren't really any instructions with it, but I had no problems figuring it out.  I am not a watch repair expert, I just needed to replace some batteries.  I was successfully using it within 3 minutes of opening it

I was able to replace a battery in my watch. It didn't come with any instructions. I experienced some of the same problems other reviewers had with the bits being loose and falling out, but I discovered you have to push them into the sockets hard. They were snug after that. Then you have to adjust the tool to fit the slots on your watch. Hold the watch in one hand. Turn left to loosen the back, then right to tighten. It came in a nice wooden box

I can't give it 5 stars, it's not perfect.

I have a lot of watch tools, and this is a nice one.  The case is nice, and it works as it should.

But, again, it's not perfect.  The pins don't stay in, making it harder to use (you have to use it upside down, and the pins don't lock in).  And there should be instructions for those who don't know exactly how to use it.  The little half-sheet that is included is all but useless.

But it's a great deal for the price.  Easily opens the notch-back cases I use it on

I was surprised at how well it has worked and ended up buying a second one.  It costs only a fraction of the price of others that do the same thing.  While it has a cheap plastic case, it doesn't look bad and is virtually noiseless.  If you have a very heavy watch I would recommend the single winder version since the watch angle is flatter (heavy watches cause the verical two-watch winder to bang around a little). My winder has been running non-stop for the past couple of months with no problems. This device is a good value for what you pay

I collect watches.  Right now I have 4 watch winders ranging in price from this one up to $$$.  This winder has been perfect so far.  It is silent, I dont mean quiet, silent.  I have it on my night stand about 3 feet from my head and I dont hear it.  The retainers are perfect for me, I have an 8.5" wrist and usually have problems with pillows that are smaller, they wont hold the bracelets.  Not a problem with this winder.  If it stays this quiet (some get louder after a while) then I will buy more, a lot more

This is by far the best deal on a watch winder yet.  It runs quiet. I have it in the same room as our desktop computer and I can't hear it over the computer cooling fan. So I would rate the sound quality in the excellent to very good range.

The overall construction is molded plastic, but for the price point that is fine.  The watch holders are very functional and have a nice spring tension mechanism that holds the watches in place.  I have a relatively small wrist and it accomodates my watches without any problems.

The unit rotates at approximately 6 rotations per minute. Based on this, each mode of operation runs as follows:

Position A = 344 RPD
Position B = 864 RPD
Position C = 1234 RPD
Position D = 2468 RPD
RPD (rotations per day)

This winder also has three seperate rotating positions: CW/Auto/CCW.  In all this is a great buy and a must for anyone with a few automatic watches in the collection.

Overall this is an excellent purches and I plan on buying another one soon

I removed links from my new Seiko band. No problem. I can see how a doofus might need the extra parts, while they are learning the proper technique. Press down FIRMLY on the band with your thumb to prevent it from moving while you turn the knob with your other hand. The base under the band is spring-loaded with a Strong spring. If you allow the band to move while you are pushing the pin out, you may break off the part that's doing the pushing. Get the band and pin lined up exactly before proceeding - or - you may break the little pusher part. Good Luck - it's a good tool.

I purchased these earrings and I am excited about the quality but not the size.  To be fair, I knew little about diamond studs until I did research on Amazon and learned a bunch over the course of a couple of weeks, but the one thing I wish I'd seen was pictures of diamond studs in "actual" size next to each other -i.e. not blown up on the screen to look pretty.  The 1/4, the 1/3, the 1/2, the 3/4, and the 1 carat total weight pairs would have been nice to see all at once.  Had I seen this I might have opted for the larger size (and perhaps slightly lower quality so as to afford it).  Yes, you can print the helpful "actual size" report from Amazon, but this does not have any small sizes except for the 1/2 and 1 carat studs (and nothing in between).

One more thing, the gemological report that I received was NOT as detailed as the "sample" on the website.  There appears to be an actual photo of my diamonds on my report but you do NOT see the drawings that show flaws and occlusions.  This would have been nice.  Also, there are fewer descriptive terms in the ratings than I expected.  For example, on my certificate it says "G-G/G-G" for Polish and Symmetry.  Although it was bound and presented well, I had hoped for something more like the sample on the website.

On the flip side, these diamonds are really high quality.  I compared them to a coworkers larger studs and it was immediately apparent that these were colorless and clear (to my eyes) while the others were a bit cloudy and not as nice.

The quality of the studs was as advertised.  One stud was VS-1 and the other was VS-2 and the color for both was G-H.  The Total Carat Weight was 0.72 (not the 0.75 as hoped for) but this was above the guaranteed minimum spec. of 0.70.

The product was received very quickly, and was well packaged and presented.  I would absolutely purchase this type of thing from Amazon again..

The color and clarity appears to be better than expected, according to IGI certification.  I have not yet brought to a jeweler for review but according to IGI I got more than I expected.  The size, however, was exactly .7 - the minimum allowable size.  I was a little upset about this so I will hope the color and clarity sparkles for my wife on Christmas morning...

All in all, good experience purchasing - just wish the size had hit a little closer to .7

The pendant is very solid, a high quality item. The stone is set firmly and it's got weight to it too. If it's your style it's a good buy. The price is right considering what a quality product it is. I think I'd trust the seller again too

I purchased the Jewel Jet in hopes of being able to keep my wife's rings as clean and sparkling as when we have them cleaned at a jewelry store. The results after using the jewel jet are as good (if not better) than when we do have them professionally cleaned.  The machine is light and easy to use.  Just fill the top with 8 oz of water, wait three minutes, and push the button.  It is that easy and the results are wonderful.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to keep their jewelry looking as new as the day it was purchased

I am impressed with how easy this machine is to use. The directions are straight forward, and the machine is ready to use almost immediately after plugging it in. Some reviewers said that this was a HUGE machine, but I didn't think it was big at all. It cleaned my diamond rings and other jewelry really well. It even shined my gold bands that had become quite dull (I didn't even notice how dull they were until the Jewel Jet made them shiny again as I was trying to clean the diamond on my ring). Overall, I think this is a great product, and I enjoy the fact that I no longer have to take my jewelry anywhere to be cleaned.

These earrings are beautiful and sturdy but a bit smaller than I expected. they are still a good deal and have good weight and good clasps. I looked at department stores and did not find anything like these or of this quality at either store. I also looked on other websites and would have had to pay more for similar earrings

They have a nice luster, feel cool and heavy when worn. The only complaint is that the gold clasps aren't very strong. Overall, very nice set and great price

You can't beat the quality and design for the price!  The watch goes well for business casual and casual.  There are many standard options including alarm, two date complications, and military time.  In addition, the watch can take a beating and withstands some pretty tough water pressure.  Pick this one up if you are into watches

Watch is perfect for my beach time and travel.  The resin band can get wet with sweat or water without the smell like other bands.  I love the dual time feature - It's great to have the hands on local time and the digital on my home turf time.  Style and features are perfect and the price was great - I love it

The watch winder works exactly as described. I think this is a good value product. Especially when compared to the multi hundreds dollar watch winders on the market. It does look a little bit plastic. But the winder is well built and is reasonably quit when turning.

It comes with 4 different timer settings and 3
different turning direction settings: left, right and alternating.
I calculated the number of rotations per day based some measurements.

Setting:
        A:  rotate 33 seconds, rest 12 minutes:  300  rotations/day
        B:  rotate 10 minutes, rest 90 minutes:  660  rotations/day
        C:  rotate 30 minutes, rest 3 hours   :  940  rotations/day
        D:  rotate 1 hour, rest 3 hours       :  1700 rotations/day

I use setting B for my watch with ETA 2824 movement. Every watch has a specific requirement as of how many rotations per day it needs to remain fully wound. See you watch specifications.

The winder does not come with the possibillity to run on batteries, that is a pity I think.

As I just bought it I can not say anyting about long term reliabillity but assuming it keeps on running I think this i a very good buy.
So far I am very pleased with it

The first thing to note is that the Timex web site claims a three-year battery life, while Amazon claims eight years.  I hope Amazon is right, but you should know what the manufacturer thinks ;)

My wife chose this watch because of its looks, and I must admit that it looks rather nice.  This is definately no-frills.  No compass, no alarm, no stopwatch.  But it tells the time and date.

Besides looking sharp, my favorite thing is the size/weight -- it is rather thin and light.  I wanted a watch with more features, but I could not stand the thought of something larger and heavier.

There is really not much to complain about.  The date display is rather small.  The band is also advertised as being "water resistant leather" but I would not want to take it swimming.  Only time will tell how it hold up.  I also do not know why watch manufacturers continue to use cheap zinc glow powder for the hands.  Newer strontium-based powders are available that still glow great after eight hours.  Oh well, all manufacturers do this, and it can light up the entire face so the glow powder is really not even needed.

So, to summarize, it is small and light for a metal men's watch, and it looks great.  Guys, one look at this and the ladies will know that you are a man who is comfortable in the deep woods

Like wearing a piece of artwork. Very substatial and highly crafted. I
would recommend it for males beacause it is big and fairly heavy.
I have a piece I bought for $38 and this design is similar. Great for silver chain and for casual dress up. Tough to beat for the price!It definitely stands out

I am a runner, and purchased this watch for timing my miles on long runs.  It is easy to read, but I found it very confusing to use the first few times.  Don't lose the instructions!  I found it easy to time laps, but had trouble with the recall portion.  I had to sit down with the instructions a few times, but once I got the hang of it, I like it.

Never did I think I would ever buy a diamond online from a discount department store. Never. But when I saw the price I thought, what could I lose? I haven't looked at it with a magnifying glass or anything, but it looks white and sparkly. Not yellow or obviously flawed at all. And nobody is going to get that close to your earrings to look for hidden flaws anyway! A great buy for the money

This is my second skagen titanium watch and both are great products. I have one silver and the latest is black.  Both watches wear and feel great when worn, they look sleek and nice while being very durable, and yes, they keep excellent time.  I am very impressed with the quality and will definitely have Skagen in mind when it's time to purchase another watch.  You will love this watch.  You can wear it for style, for dress and casual; it's a good fit for all occassions

great watch! I have had mine for several years. very elegant and very lightweight. The only issue I had with the watch is that the black mesh wears off over time. Eventually the whole band turns a metallic gray/black. I recently lost mine after several years of trouble free use and plan on buying a new one even with the worn band....

My son has severe reactions to the nickel used in most watches.  His flesh actually blisters in reaction.  Finding a watch for him has been difficult until we stumbled upon Skagen Titanium.  This is his second Skagen.  He wore the first for years until it was damaged in a basketball game.  (He refused to take it off!)  He's a junior in college now and I just purchased a second Skagen for him.  In addition to being a beautiful watch, it's an excellent time piece and we don't have to worry about any negative allergic reaction.
Thanks, Skage

The picture on the web makes the display look like the numbers are much brighter than they actually are.  I didn't think I would like the black backgound but running with this watch under bright conditions, the numbers are very easy to read.  The only complaint I have is that sometimes I don't press the lap button hard enough and I find that I haven't changed laps at my mile markers

These earrings are lovely and a tremendous value. The workmanship is excellent and the color of the agate is a deep emerald green. They seem to be very sturdy in construction and I look forward to wearing them for many years. Highly recommended!!

got my watch a few days back. 

first thing one notices, it is nicely packaged.  

however, the disappointment came when i learned that the CRYSTAL IS NOT SAPPHIRE as advertised here (usually it is stamped on the backcase), but the less expensive MINERAL. i wrote croton's customer service 2 emails regarding this issue, and got no reply - so much for one reviewer's claim of "best customer service company in america"... 

i finally got a confirmation from amazon (and very promptly - i was pleasantly surprised), that the crystal is in fact mineral - so why haven't they updated this in the product description? after all, it makes a huge difference, since sapphire is much more expensive.

nice solid case and bracelet (the clasp looks a bit weak), crystal back. the printing on the face looks kind of cheap. the glow in the dark stuff is not that good - hardly holds any "charge".

better than my $50 casio, but overall, despite the low price ($75). i wish now i had saved my money and invested in something tried like a seiko automatic instead. my next watch will be a seiko black monster

I bought this watch by pure chance while browsing, I wanted a watch that is cheap and looks good and automatic.  This watch actually is very expensive at other places, and it is actually expensive watch.  I bought it on special from Amazon, it cost me only 59 dollars.  I like the watch, and never need replacing batteries.  I am not a watch expert, and not in to watch qualities, but this watch is good

Heavy stainless steel, sapphire crystal, Japanese automatic movement AND it looks great!  I got this with free shipping at an EXTREMELY (under $70.00) reduced price via a previous Amazon Friday Sale - well worth it - now that I think of it, I should have bought more as presents..

Just got it today from amazon, very nice watch very sharp looking. Black dial makes the look of it. I have simular watch with silver/while dial from Missimo. I needed another one to go with my black suites and to wear to work, that is not bulky or heavy. Overall very pleased with the purchase. One thing though, it was very important that bracelet is a Fold Over Clasp type. You can not tell from the photo and pulsar's website does not mention the bracelet type either, but it is. So for those who want nice watch with Fold Over Clasp bracelet and does not want to spend a lot i would definitely recomend checking this out. Hope this helps

As I was shopping for a new watch, I had a certain number of criteria in mind.

1.  It must be affordable
2.  It must be from a recognized brand (for quality purposes)
3.  It must be stylish without being too fad-ish
4.  It must be multi-purpose and lend itself to almost all 
    styles of dress, be it casual or formal.

I found all of this in this little Seiko watch.  At first, I was setting my sights on a no-battery type of design, but after reading about both kinetic and solar watches...and finding out that both do require replacement of either a lithium ion battery or capacitor, neither of which were guaranteed to last longer than a regular battery operated watch...I decided to stick with the regular quartz.

The watch itself looks better than its picture.  The dial is listed as white on the website, but it's actually a silver tone...similar to what you see on Rolex brands (which it's supposed to mimic).  The gold has a nice shine to it, with particular sparkle coming from the marked hours and the pie-cut bezel around the watch face.  There is luminous material on the watch hands and hour markers, but a very minimal amount.  My guess is that they didn't want to detract from the shiny finish, but you do lose some ability to see the watch face at night.  There's enough to see the watch hands...just barely...but the hours are really hard to make out in the dark.  Oh well, if checking the time at night is a real issue then I suggest looking at some Timex Indiglos. ***REVISION*** While it is hard to see the luminous hands and markers at first, they do get brighter once your eyes adjust to the dark.  I found myself waking up early this morning and could clearly see all the marked hours and hands of my watch face with no problems.

This watch also comes with a day and date calendar.  Some have said it's hard to work, but I actually found it to be really easy.  The instructions are very easy to follow and I had the calendar and time set up in about 2 minutes.  

This watch is surprisingly lightweight and very comfortable to wear.  The catch opens without breaking any nails off and the band is very roomy.  I have a medium to large sized wrist and wear my watch in a slightly loose "bracelet" style, but I still had to get a couple of links taken out.

My verdict:  a good watch at a good price.  It goes with everything in my closet and is from a company that's known for excellence and durablility.  Five Stars

This is a great watch. I like that you can wear both silver and gold with it. I like the fact that it's water proof but I still take it off to go in the shower or in the pool. It often gets mistaken for a Rolex

This necklace is a cute toggle knockoff. It isn't even real silver for Pete's sake but no one would be able to tell from just looking while you're wearing it. It did fit me a little tighter than expected. But I never had one of these so I didnt know what to expect. Plus I guess it depends on weight, neck size etc. Anyway, I thought it was going to be a hunk of junk since it is only five dollars but bought a few for my nieces because they needed costume jewelry. Beleive it or not this baby is nice enough to wear out. Don't believe me ? Gamble the five dollars

I do not own this version, but another Invicta, as well as other watches with screw down crowns. What this means is you cannot pull out the crown without unscrewing it, which is done counter clockwise. It will then pop out. Then you push the crown in and screw it clockwise with gentle inward pressure to screw it down.
There is some discussion of the proper care while using the crown on the web. Apparently this is the area where you have the greatest potential to do damage to your watch, any watch. So be gentle, especially when setting the time, date, etc. With most watches you shouldn't do this near midnight. And perhaps do a search on the Web.
The Invicta instruction booklets are completely generic, so it is not surprising that some people might be confused

The instruction manual is not very accurate. The watch seems to work as advertised. One reviewer here mentioned that they couldn't pull the pin out to adjust the time, per the instructions in the manual. I had the same problem, but what they forgot to mention was you had to turn the pin counter clock-wise, then the pin will pop out a little, then one can pull the pin out to adjust the time. When you are done, you do the reverse. So far, I am happy with my purchase. Smart looking watch

I was looking for a watch that I would feel comfortable wearing to business engagements and yet still not feel over-accessorized walking though The Home Depot. This watch came up numerous times in searches in Amazon. The criteria I was looking for was 1) sapphire crystal, 2) multi-faced dial, 3) not too flashy, and 4) price. The biggest problem with the typical "fashionably sporty" watch is that the faces are too big or too thick or simply contrasts too much with the band. I dislike black faced dials on a polished bezel and band. This watch had it all.

The watch is of the utmost quality. You could go to Macy's and pay $400 for this same watch. The band is nicely polished and the clasp is typical Seiko, that's good. The hands are all aligned perfectly in the 12 position and adjustable if they're not. Mine were not out of the box. The hands are actually blue, but provides a nice hint of color on an otherwise bland face, very appealing. There is a nice weight to the watch. Its actually lighter than other similarly sized steel watches I've had.

There is no light, so previous reviewers comments on after-hours time checks are accurate. The hands are typical luminescent hands. They hold the light for 20 minutes maybe. You won't be waking up at night to check the time on this time piece, but that's why you have an alarm clock.

The deciding factor for me was the sapphire crystal. It was a must. I'm not one to spend $500 on a watch because I'm very hard on them. A mineral crystal is simply too easily scratched. I liked some of the Citizen designs, but simply won't spend that kind of money for a mineral crystal. For Seiko quality, with a sapphire crystal under $150 this is a steal.  Overall, I'm very happy; 5 stars.

The only reason I rated this as 4 stars is that you can't really see the hour and minute hands in the dark.  I know the description says that the hands are luminescent but they really aren't.  Other than that, the watch looks great - has the right balance of sporty and class

I bought these for my twenty-something sister-in-law... she loved them and put them on right away.  They ARE small, so be aware; she is tiny with delicate features, and usually only wears stud earrings, so they were perfect on her. These would be too small for someone who usually wears larger or flashier earrings.

There is a bit of space between the stones and the metal that doesn't really show in the pictures, but it's nothing you notice once they are on. In all, a great value

These high quality well made earrings are smaller than a dime. The stones continue on the bottom of the earrings, but there are not stones inside the back (in other words they are not an inside/out design). Instead there is a nice scroll design on the backside of the loop. 

I'm very pleased with my purchase. I do wish they were larger or that amazon offered the same earring in a larger hoop size

I honestly wasn't expecting much for $1.99 although I did buy two of them. What a surprise though. Very very nice little bracelets. Very tiny white creamy bead type pearls with irregular shapes that look very good that way and fit on my wrist very easily and look great. I pushed them up my arm a bit so that they fit a little tighter, looks better that way I think. Identical I think as well to what is pictured on the amazon page. I also own expensive pearls and no they aren't as nice as those but for the money it's a sweet somewhat elegant look. Especially when you wear two of them together. And yes they definately are cute and stretchy. Not bad for 5 bucks altogether. It ain't Mikimoto but I am absolutely satisfied.

It lookes very nice on the my thin wrist. But be noticed that the shape of the pearls is irregular. At first I was dissappointed about that. Later on I found that the oval shape of the pearls is actually pretty cute

I love them they are small enough for everyday wear, and people coment on them often about how they like the smaller size and how they have a nice shine to them. I also usally have problems with my ears hurting or getting sore after wearing some earring but not with these and this type of metal defently worth the price

I bought this watch and it really looks cool and feminine. I love the style of the stainless steel band and the pink dial. It can be dressed up or down. 

It goes well with Pink, purple or peach color clothings...or just about anything. 

A definite buy and keep.

I was looking for a nice dress watch or might I say my wife wanted me to look for nicer dress watch.  When I scolled down to the Kinetic Coutura Watch #SNP008 on Amazon's web site, it blew my mind away. I went to a local jewery store and viewed one in person, then ran back and ordered it from Amazon! It's a beautiful watch, very expensive looking, but without the cost!  I was debating between  a Rolex or this Seiko Kinetic Coutura and I choose it, and I'm glad.  It looks just as nice for thousand of dollars less.  If you don't wear it every day it will stop, but I like the way the time and date adjust with just a couple of shakes.  It brings a smile to my face each and everytime I put it on.  I have had numerous compliments from friends and they all guess it cost a couple of thousand dollars.  When I tell them the cost, they can't believe it.  If your looking for a beautiful dress watch, this is it! Amazon's price was the best

Did several days of research and came to this conclusion...  For the watch that I was looking for, I would have to pay somewhere around $1000 and up or I could get the Seiko.  It was a "no brainer" for me at least.

Titanium was the only thing that was missing on my list for the perfect watch.  Owning a Seiko Titanium Kinetic (10 yrs.), I can tell you the importance of having the Sapphire crystal.  The band wore down before the face did (I tend to be a little rough on watches.)

I shopped for many months to replace a twenty year old Seiko.  When I saw the Coutura I knew I had found the replacement.  It has striking looks and state-of-the-art features.  The Coutura is a flawless and accurate timepiece with the look and feel of the finest watches in the world

I really do love this watch and get compliments on it all the time, but just a couple things bothered me that led me to leave a 4 star rating instead of 5.

- My resin strap started cracking within 1 year and I looked high and low in many store and specialty watch shops for a replacement. Turned out that the strap is pretty much custom and no standard Ironman replacement strap would fit it exactly. I had to call Timex customer service to obtain the replacement, so I got 1 extra just in case. I tried to replace the strap by myself, but it was SUPER difficult. Timex used a really tight non-springed pin and I was only able to get one of the pins partially out. I started damaging the metallic casing, so I took it to a watch repair shop to finish what I couldn't complete. The repairman thought it was going to be an easy task, but it wasn't. He said it took a long time to pry the pin out and it broke as he tried to remove it. When he finally got it out, he used a spring-loaded pin instead to make it easier next time. Oh yeah, and he replaced the strap.

- About a week ago I tossed the watch on the kitchen counter and the backplate fell off. I tried to snap it and tap it back in, but in wouldn't  go. Seems like it's a tight fit. Looks like I'll be visiting the watch repair store again.

Other than these two issues, I love this watch. I think most men will enjoy this watch, just be aware that the straps are hard to find... and replace

At first it felt really heavy, but now I don't mind at all, and I like that it feels built like a tank. It's comfortable, really cool looking, and looks like an analog watch, if you want. I've been wanting something like this for a really long time, so I'm glad it exists

I got this necklace for myself, and it is beautiful.  I ended up giving it to a teenage niece of mine, and I plan on ordering one for myself and a few friends.  It is really beautiful for the amount I paid.  THANKS

I was really impressed by these pearls!  The price is amazing for the quality that you get!  The pearl earrings I ordered shipped fast and came in a little gift box.  It made for the perfect Christmas present.  Without a doubt I would recommend these earrings or this seller to anyone who's interested in pearls

I'm an RN and bought this watch mainly for work purposes.  It's stylish and simple, not overly flashy.  Has a convenient second hand which is an essential for me.  The size is perfect, as my wrists are really small and I hate huge watches.  I'd say this face is about the size of a nickel.  The weight is light, making it barely noticable while on but at the same time durable.

My only complaint is that I thought "self adjustable" links meant you can take links out yourself.  Since my wrists are small, every watch I've owned I've had to take to a jeweler to get links taken out.  I bought this watch mainly because of the bonus of self adjustable links.  My husband was finally able to take 4 links out but only after getting a tiny, tiny screwdriver which was noted in the enclosed instructions.  So don't expect these links to just pop in and out as I did.  Other than that, a good value for the price

Today my hus asked me that why I wanted to wear the watch at home?(I usually don't wear watch at home.)I replied that I liked it, and asked him to mind his own business! My hus smiled and walked away. Well, I didn't want to be rude, actually it was the gift from my hus. He has worn a skagen watch for over 10 years. He only changed the batteries, and the watch is still in very good condition. Don't wait! Join skagen club right away

I was pleasantly surprised when I received this watch in the mail, looks much better for real than it does in the pictures. For the price, this watch is hard to beat & is very stylish. Everyone that has seen this black beauty on my hand has complimented my watch (I've had 2 guys offer to buy it from me :-). The only con is that of the 3 mini dials, the one for the day of the month is kinda hard to read... no big deal! Great buy

I was sckeptical of the rubber band, but it looks good and is comfortable.  Like the other reviewer stated the dials on the face are just about useless they are so small, I actually can't even read the time without pausing to count the numbers on the face.  Despite this, the watch is very classy without being overboard like some big gold Rolex or something.  (My watch had red dials instead of the white shown in the picture

A fine looking, elegant, "sporty" watch, very light and comfortable. My only complaint is the sub-dials - the numbers/letters are so tiny as to be just about useless, especially the date dial, with 31 numbers crowded in. That said, though - I like it a lot, and I wear it a lot. My recommendation: check out any watch "live and in person" before you buy it online.

This bracelet is a good width and a good weight.  This is not a piece that goes unnoticed on the wrist.  If you are a woman that likes "big" jewelry this is a nice piece.

I like this bracelet enough that I am planning on purchasing a necklace to wear with this and I am a picky consumer.  This piece is equally nice with jeans or a black suit.

I recommend both this product and this seller.

I Just ordered and received this automatic watch winder (the Garinin model WIN2GR, for two watches) and have used it for about a week (I am using it to wind an Invicta automatic and a Breitling automatic). The unit is pretty well all plastic, and has a "cheap" - yet "solid" - look and feel. Still, it does work as advertised, and this, not appearance, is the primary reason I bought it. So, for the price, I give it one thumb up. A few minor points to note, however. First, I have large wrists, so the removable expanding watch restrainers do not expand enough to restrain the watches securely in their slots. This was remedied by placing two 1" self-adhering felt pads (available at the local hardware store) to the top surface of each restrainer. But this then created a secondary, though less serious, problem: the front door of the winder now does not close all the way (comes to within about " of fully closing). Not a problem unless you live in an exceptionally dusty environment. Second, some reviewers have noted a noise problem with this unit. However, I found that mine runs very quietly. I keep it next to the bed, on the bottom of my nightstand, and on a quiet night I can just barely hear the low purring sound of the motor inside the unit. Even then, you have to really focus your attention in order to hear it, and, in my view, only a picky critic would find this soft noise to be the least bit disturbing. Finally, there is a switch for selecting the direction in which the watches rotate: either clockwise or counterclockwise (they are linked, so both rotate in the same direction at all times). What is not made clear is why the winding direction is important. If my watches are supposed to be wound in only one of these directions, how am I to know which one it is? Furthermore, how do I control the winding direction when I am actually wearing the watches? And finally, what if the Invicta needs to be wound clockwise but the Breitling should be wound counterclockwise? I arbitrarily selected one of the directions and moved on ... both watches still work just fine.

In closing, note that there are some humorous statements in the one-page instruction manual. The unit is identified as a "Time Tutelary" (which name also appears as a logo on the front of the unit pictured in the manual). What is a "time tutelary," anyway? The instructions state, "Please pull off the adapter when the winder is not using," and, "This product provides maintenance or replacement service within one year from the purchasing date." I know what is meant here, but still, this is a case of either poor English or poor translating (or both!). Further to the warranty statement itself, note that there is an outlined box at the bottom of the manual in which is stated, "Invalid without representative's official stamp." The problem is, there is no stamp in the box (or anywhere else for that matter), so the only reasonable conclusion is that there is NO warranty for this product.

I also ordered a second winder, a Garinin single-watch winder, model WIN1BRG, as a present for my son. I mention this to note that the operation manual accompanying this unit states, "Using a timer is recommended with this product. This will ensure that your watch is wound properly and will extend the life of your winder and your automatic watch. On average an automatic watch should be wound four hours a day." (Note that no such statement accompanies the two-watch WIN2GR winder.) First, is this 4 hours-maximum-per-day claim true? And second, if the winder automatically rotates for one hour and then rests for the next three hours, it winds your watch a total of 6 hours per day, so is the extra two hours of winding really all that detrimental to the watch? And, if eliminating those two extra hours of winding each day (by using a timer) will actually "extend the life of your winder," it doesn't seem to say much about the quality and designed-in reliability of the product (not to mention adding to the expense and hassle of ownership).

Bottom line: if you want a quiet two-watch winder that works as advertised, but don't want to spend a lot of money (and don't mind the plastic look), this winder should do the trick.

My wife loves this necklace. It isn't as fancy, as expensive, or with near as many diamonds as some of her others. But it is simple and attractive, and for the price, I would say definitely worth it.

The is perfectly sized, about 2 cm in outside diameter. Every third groove that you see on the picture has a little diamond in it. So, "diamond accented" is a proper description. 

If you, or your significant other, likes simplicity and the looks of this pendant, I recommend that you go for it

It's only a $15 necklace, so I wasn't expecting anything spectacular. The chain is kind of flimsy, but I have other silver chains and I just put it in one of those.

Very cute for a semi-casual night out, lots of people complimented it

I bought this for myself to celebrate a milestone in my life and I couldn't be happier.  Adusting the watch to fit my wrist was simple (contrary to one review - Skagen gives you easy, detailed instructions, but I figured it out before reading the instructions), and I'm already getting many compliments on it.  It looks far more expensive than its price.  And I love that the case is quite slim.  Gorgeous watch!

I've had this watch for 3 yrs, the band is starting to fade a little (though I got a compliment on it just yesterday) and I want to get a new one before they are no longer available.  Great watch, is not water resistant, but it's been wet several times.  I've gotten a little condensation on the inside of the crystal numerous times (I'm a nurse and I wash my hands frequently-yeah, I know, I should have a water resistant watch, but this one is so pretty!), but it's always worked perfectly.  Tons of compliments on it, looks expensive and I can't destroy it with my rough treatment

This is my second Skagen. It's much thinner than my older watch. The 7-year old watch still works perfectly, but I wanted a new treat.

I think this watch is a great in-between of formal and informal. The goldtone really sparkles and the crystals on the face add a touch of elegance. One of the features I like most about the Skagen mesh bands is that they are adjustable. And the Amazon price was great!

I highly recommend this watch.

I bought this for my wife this Christmas (and gave it to her early -- couldn't help myself).  This normally wouldn't have been the kind of thing I picked out for her.  She says I have good taste in jewelry, but I usually choose either diamonds or colored semiprecious stones for her.  This seemed kind of plain from the picture.  Nevertheless, it was on her wish list, so I bought it.

One thing to note is that the pendant is relatively small -- but not too small.  It shows up nicely as long as she's wearing something like a turtleneck or other plain sweater.  It would get lost if she wore a busier pattern.  Also -- and this is my one disappointment with the piece -- it is "one-sided".  In other words, the way it appears in the picture is the way it will appear on the wearer.  You can't turn it around to form a "C" shape.  This is because the back of the pendant is flat, and the filligree is not really visible.  Not a huge deal, though.

A nice piece, overall

Fairly pleased with these. I like the anklet and the bracelet done in this style quite a bit more, but these are not bad at all.

I kind of wished the crystals on the string were flexible such that were a person to move their head they would not always stay in a straight line. I mean don't get me wrong... the earrings dangle and will move. They look to all be mounted on a silver rod, which will swing from the top. Maybe this was done for a reason, but I think they'd look nicer mounted on a loose cord. And for all I know I'd complain about the lack of structure and symmetry.

Anyway... from a damned picky person, these are quite nice

I've had this watch since December 06' and it's working out great! I really like the yellow face, it's my favorite color, and the whole thing is quite sturdy. The only gripe I have with this watch is the fact that it really does go about 5 minutes too fast a week. I really don't mind that though because adjusting the time is quick and easy, takes a few seconds, and then it's done! I would recommend this watch to anyone who doesn't mind adjusting it now and then.

This is a great knock-around watch as well as a great dive watch.  If you're thinking of buying one be awhere that it is an automatic watch, once called autowind watch.  This watch doesn't use a battery and is wound by the movement of your arm.  If you set it down for a couple of days, it will stop.  I guess we're all too use to quartz battery watches to remember the old days of winding watches

I bought this for $19.99 as a Gold Box special because of the price. The picture above looks very washed out and does not do it justice. I just received it today and it is absolutely stunning, not washed out like the picture above. I came back here to see what the price was, to perhaps buy more to give for Christmas gifts. At $29.99 it would be worth buying again for myself if I didn't already have it, but since Xmas is so far off I will wait for something similar in the Gold Box and buy 10 of them. The blue is gorgeous. I wish I had gotten it in the purple color as well

Buen producto y a buen costo. Me ha funcionado perfectamente desde que lo adquiri y mantiene mis relojes en hora cuando lo necesito.
No le doy las 5 estrellas porque es plstico y pensaba que la parte gris era de aluminio u otro material.
De todos modos es un buen producto y hace el trabajo, si es comparado con los demas de este tipo que son sumamente caros.

This review is a bit mixed.  While this is a children's silver locket, I ordered it for my mom to wear on her charm bracelet.  When it arrived I was pleased with the quality, it was high polished sterling silver with a small diamond accent, as described.  However, I wasn't at all pleased with the packaging and the front of the heart was scratched, right next to the diamond.  Also the chain was a tangled mess and I can't get the knot out.  Basically it comes in a blue jewelry pouch which would look pretty if there were a small box INSIDE the pouch with the necklace mounted on it.  Instead they just throw the necklace into the pouch.  I am glad I had it shipped to me and not the recipient.  I would have been embarassed for her to get it like this.  They are sending me a replacement and the shipping was free and only two days transit time.  So, if the replacement isn't scratched and tangled, it should be lovely.  Incidentally, I reduced some photos to fit the locket and it should be just adorable once its all put together

I couldn't be happier with this. Its industrial design looks every bit as good in person as it does on the computer screen. And you can't beat the price, considering I've seen the same exact item elsewhere for $150

FYI, Titanium is a LIGHTWEIGHT, extremely durable metal. If you want pretty and shiny, splurge on some white gold, and skip this item. I love it personally, and my construction engineer boyfriend does too. This necklace is perfect for active men

This is a watch that is very functional for everyday use. For the money, you cannot beat it. It is easy to use whether in the shower or swimming, and handy to see in the middle of the night or in a movie. Goes with anything and is easy to put on and take off.

I'm very happy with my new watch.  I had to have several links removed from the band by a jeweler, but now it fits perfectly. The style is just right for my casual lifestyle and I like the "silver and gold" combination for coordinating with other jewelry.  And for senior eyes, the numbers on the dial are big enough to read easily

Basically, I was looking for lightweight titanium day/date watch. Seiko is probably (or at least as far I was searching) practically only brand that has these parameters in this price range.
Got a good deal, free shipping (otherwise DHL costs around 30-40$ to Finland). The minus was that Finland's customs, thanks to EU, slammed me 46,01 customs tax bill :( It still costed with taxes for me about 181 compared to Finland's prices: cheaper versions like SGG709 cost here 189-219 and this SGF709 would have costed even more.
To try to be critical - only negative notice about the watch is that seconds dial is not exactly aligned, it is 1/4 of a second behind. So - good but not perfect :

hour/minute/second hands analogue face that is lightweight, sealed and water resistant to withstand slight submersion, has a secure lightweight locking titanium hypoallergenic bracelet, and an easy to read analogue dial with hands that glow in the dark after exposure to light. Titanium is not only lightweight but stronger than steel.

This lightweight dress watch was purchased as an alternative to my heavy Seiko diver's watch still running well after 25 years. The SGF709 has no alarm nor chronograph and there are less expensive models if you don't want a day of the week or second hand. But, I like the weight and features of this model plus my spouse likes the looks; so it was a great purchase

This watch is very smart looking, keeps great time and feels very comfortable on my arm.  The sale made it very affordable, which I really appreciated as I was able to get it with a gift certificate I received for my birthday.  Amazon gift certificates make wonderful gifts.  I have never had a watch this nice in the past.  Thanks to Amazon for prompt delivery and nice product.

i am not a professional cycler so I can't really comment on the quality of this monitor, I only know that it is certaintly enough for an amateur like me; it shows me the heart rate in different displays; with the time or with the our, etc. It has a review feature which shows the calories burned, the average heart rate, etc. I think it's great

I bought this for its affordability and seemingly simple operations and have had good success with it so far.  The heart rate monitor strap that fits around your chest sometimes doesn't read correctly unless there's wetness between the sensors and your skin (water/perspiration) so it can be frustrating at times when you get incorrect readings.  Overall I think it serves its purpose for my heartrate monitoring while training for my triathlon

It's a very good product. It's working really well for me. It gives me an alarm when I'm out of the heart rate zone that I want to work and on the end of my workout I can review my progress, such as avg heart rate, maximum heart rate, time on the zone that I'd choosen and the calories burned during this workout. Beyond this, it has an alarm clock, a time counter, it's water proof. I'm having a very good use of it. I recommend it

I've been in the fitness field for nearly two decades and have considerable experience with heart rate monitors.  This Timex model is worth it's salt and has plenty of features for the money.  It has all the features you'll need as an average exerciser and non of the features you pay too much for and don't use.  Timex rarely has a quality issue and I don't understand the bad experiences some have had here but it happens with all products and brands from time to time.  I recommend this model.  By the way, Polar is over-rated in the industry, charges too much for their products and I have found their batteries don't last long and their products require being sent back to the manufacturer for replacement.  Not user friendly when you can't do it yourself.  Goodluck with your decision.

I am extremely impressed with the feel, look and general quality of the watch.  It contains the Citizen Miyota 21 jewel automatic movement that is a true workhorse for a fraction of the price.  The comfortable stainess steel pinned link bracelet is worth the price of the watch. It has rounded flexible brushed steel wrist links The foldover adjustable double safety clasp uses pins as well. Can easily be mistaken for a watch costing much more.  The Mineral Glass crystal is scratch resistant - but not as good as a sapphire watch face, but is less prone to chipping or shattering than a sapphire crystal. The display watchback is also mineral glass - displaying the undecorated Miyota automatic movement. It look as stylish and run as well as my other watches, and, I receive as many comments if not more from the Invicta's.  It is a great looking watch!  Good value, accurate and stylish if you like the Sub' look. This is a good day-to-day knock about watch that still looks better than the quartz stuff in the same price range. If it lasts 5 years it's more than paid for itself.  If you would like more information and talk with others about Invicta's  or other watches visit www.thewatchcentral.com.  All questions and comments will be responded to

How can you do better than this?  The bracelet is shiny and the watch face is the prettiest I have ever seen.  All made by the Seiko Co.  The band was the right length and it is the bargain of the century.  I got this watch and another Lorus work of art for $11, which is just extraordinary!

I use this watch everyday at work and working out.  Looks great. Very comfortable and no problems so far. Would definitely recommend this watch if you're looking for a watch to wear while exercising and while going out on a friday night.

I had a rubber cord just like this one before, but it got damaged. I liked it so much that I had to get another one. I've bought several items from Silver Insanity and I must say that I'm really happy and impressed with the service. I ordered the rubber cord and two other items on the same day and Silver Insanity combined the order for me (without realizing it, I had placed the orders separately) saving me 15 dollars

I've had this watch for 4-5 years and it's been great.  I paid almost 400 for it then.  The only thing I've needed to do is change the battery this past summer.  Some of the gold tone has worn off in a few places on the band, but this is normal for the age of this watch.  
I've used it scuba diving, swimming (salt and fresh), snow skiing, and working on the car (most punishment yet).  I've slammed the face into brick walls and metal railings without a problem (not on purpose).  I would recommend this watch/brand to anyone interested.

I'll preface this by saying that my tastes run toward higher-end jewelry.  I bought this as an inexpensive surprise gift for my wife, as she likes things like this.  She loves it!  She's received numerous compliments on it, and wears it often.  It does look better in real life than it does in the picture, as it does a good job reflecting the light.  It arrived promptly, and was enclosed in a small but secure package

I bought this watch some time ago and my 9-year old loves it.  The design of the watch is interesting...instead of a second hand, its a clear circular plastic disc with gecko designs on it, so that as it turns, the geckos rotate around the watch face.  Some months after I bought it, that disc must have loosened and came off.  I emailed ProSport Watches and they sent a new watch together with a postage paid envelope for me to return the old one in - what an outfit!  The new one works fine and my daughter was delighted all over again

Again, a watch without acknowledging movement maker. Has day/date and sizing is a breeze. This is a heavy watch and keeps good time. The price for a Fossil at under $40.00 is a steal.Easy to read, only during lighted conditions. Has a double safety clasp, not found on cheaper watches. A bargain at this price.

I was reluctant to buy this watch, since I was not familiar with Tissot brand. Only when I spoke to my European friends and mentioned the name they said: you can't go wrong for that price. The watch is simple, yet very classy. Higly recommended.

I have owned several of these watches, currently have and are using two of them. I have abused them to no end and the only thing that seems to do them in is when the battery finally gives out. (I have had mixed luck with keeping them working AFTER replacing the battery. Could be the technical abilities on my end...) I am active outdoors and have worn my watch: horseback riding (daily), swimming, ran it through the wash cycle, dropped it, and struck the doorjamb with my wrist/watch face as I was walking through it. These watches are a classic style with Timex quality--this model truly "takes a licking and keeps on ticking" and I highly recommend it for anyone with an active lifestyle.

I bought this watch because it was inexpensive and had an alarm. It continues to be my favorite watch. 

I wondered if the band would hold up to wear and tear.  It has held up well showing little wear or dirt. 

I bought it in blue and it matches many colors surprisingly well.  It keeps perfect time, the alarm is reliable and I get compliments on how it looks.  It is not like the usual alarm sport watch  that is bulky and ugly. 

I have even forgotten to change it and even had it on with dress clothes. Any other sport watch I would have taken off and hidden away but I wore this one anyway.

This watch is a great bargain

These earrings are beautiful! Very delicate tho, right when I received them I put them on and they broke! But that's ok because the wonderful seller (CoolStyles) said they would send me a new pair and sure enough in todays mail were my earrings!!! They look and sparkle just like real diamonds! And you cant beat the price for sterling silver, they actually look like white gold! So lets review....$8.99 for beautiful, sterling silver diamond look-a-likes, fast shipping, and GREAT sellers that go out of their way to make a customer happy! OH!! And they come in a very pretty satin zip pouch! HIGHLY RECOMMEND SELLER!! You cant go wrong

I purchased the watch as a birthday present for my fiancee. She absolutely loves it! The face is pink (which is her favorite color) and the face is big enough to read without being too large. The watch is subdued enough to wear daily and dressy enough to wear on special occasions. Truly a Perfect Present!

Atomic watches are highly-accurate quartz watches which are synchronized each day with a time signal broadcast from the definitive U.S. Atomic Clock in Ft. Collins, Colorado. Thus, all atomic watches are always accurate to within a fraction of a second at any time. Since atomic watches adjust automaticaly to and from daylight saving time they are the ultimate in accurate watches. Casio makes -- and Amazon sells -- a wide selection of styles of atomic watches to suit various needs and tastes, but all are equally accurate. The Casio G-Shock series is especially rugged and the solar powered models, such as this, never require battery replacement. Atomic accurary, solar power, and G-Shock ruggedness is an appealing combination at a quite reasonable price

This is a solid watch, it is bulky and if you are like me and wear polo shirts a lot thats not a problem, but with the dress shirts i do opt for a different timepiece.  It was set to the right time when i got it..I actually bought it because of friend of mine who just got back from IRAQ told me about the quality and it it can live up to that standard i am sure it can take the punishment i will give it.  Awesome i will never have to set the time or change a batter

Great watch x trainnig specially for running since is very light and easy to use. Unfortunatelly is the 3rd one (yes 2 mine and 1 of my son) that lets watter in while in the pool/beach (light swiming or playing with the kids). It seems like IT IS NOT watter ressitant. On the first one I tought it was "bad luck", but after 3...
I still think is the best one outhere and actually just order 2 more to replace the recent cassualties (x my son and myself), but it would be nice if you can tell TIMEX to "correct" their insulation problem. 
Thank you, fc

I bought the watch in Dec and have gone on many long runs where I needed to keep a constant pace.  This watch is perfect for determining the pace at the mile markers.  It's intuitive and very easy to use.  Getting the data out is a little more difficult, but doable.  I highly recommend it for runners

these earrings are ideal for every day and all night wear. I have very senstive skin,(i.e. rashes from anything less than 14K gold to rashes from clothing tags) I wear these earrings daily(I sleep in them too) in fact, they do not come out unless I am going somewhere fancy and need to switch to something flashier

It get's 4 stars because, well what would you expect, the slide rule is accurate to 2 decimal places. And it could have given you 3. Oh well. If you are using your watch to calculate your arrival time you probably don't really care if you are off by a few minutes.

Ok, why is a circular slide rule cool? First, lots of common calculations are really just ratios. Kilometers to miles or statue miles to nautical miles, pounds to Kilograms's. This watch has the markers in the slide rule, so you just align one mark with the number you want to convert and look at the number that the other unit of measure is over and there you are. You do have to keep track of the magnitude of the answer but that's not hard. You can do sq roots but it's a pain. Basic multiplication and division is easy. Doing the approximation for a tip at restraunt, just set the percentage over the "10" mark, and look for you bill at the inside ring, read the tip on the outside ring. No need to even adjust the watch. You can easily set it up before dinner. Note: if you stare at your watch while trying to read the tip value, you may get called "rude" by your date! Better to just overestimate...

Downside, if you do not have perfect vision, you'll have a hard time reading the sliderule. Don't even think about doing this while you are driving. My eyes are fine with it in good light.

On the other hand, the time hands and numerals are plenty large enough and easy to read. The luminescent marks seem to stay bright for about an hour, which is good enough for us casual night hawks. Otherwise you need a watch that has tritium and who knows whether that will pass airport security these days.

One other thing is that the 24 hr inner hand can be easily obscured by the main watch hands. So this feature not very handy as a second timezone clock. It will help you remember the military time, but at say 11:00 you can't see the underlying hand. Not a big thing, and I suppose if you set to say 8 or 9 hours difference it might be more visible.

All in all, a cool watch, even if the slide rule control is built for a lefty

I purchased this watch for my 22 year old son for Christmas. He is graduating from the UofA soon and will make his way out into the business world following graduation. He told me that he would like to have a "nice" watch now. This was quite an unusual request coming from him. As I love watches myself, I decided it had to be very special, so he would love, wear and take care of it! I must have looked at a hundred different watches and even actually purchased another brand at Sears, only to return it. I finally settled on this sweet baby. It really looks great on the wrist. It is a very handsome, heavy and distingushed piece of stainless steel. I was so impressed with this watch, I plan to get one for myself...

They match a pair of peridot studs that I had ordered from Jewelsforme through Amazon, as well as a pair of leverback blue topaz earrings I have.  (I have many holes in my ears) Highly reccomend these earrings!

I actually bought these earrings as a gift, but I think I might order a second pair for myself.  These earrings are the perfect size, not too small, but still very feminine looking. The gemstones sparkle and are very eye catching and the gold is the perfect compliment.  You will not be sorry for this purchase.

My girlfriend Eunice gave me this watch for my birthday, and was surprice because the first time i saw it i told her that i like it, and i never imagine that she was going to buy it for me, i love her and i love it.
Well the watch looks great, is nice, the fund colors are nice and you can set it with one of the two colors RED or BLACK, or set it with the two colors, every three seconds switch of colors.
I recomended this watch to anyone.

I got this watch for my boyfriend and he seemed to like it. Note, he is not a 'suit and tie' man so it went w/ his overall casual style. I got exactly what I expected apart from the fact that the 'red tint' portrayed in the picture actually fades in and out w/ a black background. In other words, it does not look red all of the time. There might be a way to program this so that it does, but neither of us have bothered looking into it yet

This is a great watch.  I have a small wrist and it fits my wrist perfectly,
though it could be used on a wrist of any size. It's an attractive watch that
can be used every day and also when your dressed up. For the money it can't be beat!

I received this as a gift about 8 months ago and am happy with everything about it--the size, the style, the color of the face, the polished silver finish, and the timekeeping. The quality is excellent. My favorite thing about it is the face--it is such a beautiful light pink color with a mother-of-pearl sheen to it, and the diamond at the 12 is the perfect touch

Was looking for a rather tiny watch for my small 5 1/2" wrist.  Another customer's review giving the measurements of the face/case was very helpful. It would be extremely helpful if the measurements were included in the description of all watches posted.  This would save the customer time and money should they have to return a watch because it wasn't the size that they expected. Otherwise, watch is keeping accurate time

This watch is very nice. It goes will with a dress or a pair of jean. However, this watch is VERY TINY, the diameter of this watch is LESS than 20mm (including the stainless ring) and it's exactly 15mm for the diameter of the dial, so if you have a middle to large wrist (you probably want to go for a different watch, because big wrist (sadly, which i am) and this watch just don't go together!) I wish Amazon had indicated that little detail on the watch information before i brought this watch. Anyway, another thing is that the pink color on the dial, it's NOT light pink like i was expecting/hoping. It's more like a milky light peach pink, I can't even describe the color, i think it's kinda of a strange pink. (maybe it's just the watch I receive or something, i am not sure about that).Overall, i still think this is a nice watch, which i think it truly deserves a 4 stars at the current price they are selling.

This is a beautiful, classy casual watch without a lot of gaudy embellishments. Can work for dressy occasions or casual. It has a high polish finish, not a matte finish. The bracelet is narrow and dainty without being too delicate. The case and bracelet are heavy and high quality. The face has a diamond at '12', metal markers at the other 3 quadrants, and a nice little white dot at the intermediate hours to make this easy to read. Note, no second hand or date.

Came in nice presentation box with US warranty (some other dealers may not provide authorized warranty).

At $65 (price paid at Amazon) this is a real bargain. Same watch is $129 at BlueNile

These earrings look much nicer in person. They are lovely, rich-blue and sparkly topaz stones. They have polished, and substantial white gold settings.These are not too small and not too large. Just right for every day.The price is excellent too! It was packaged extremely well. Apart from the exterior packaging the earrings were enclosed inside a felt jewelry box which was within another gift box.This was my first jewelry puchase from Amazon. I was not disappointed and will look for other jewelry needs from Amazon in the future :)

A solid good looking watch for those who like or need databank function.  I like having my phone numbers on the watch even though I use my cell phone directory more. You can store other data involving names/numbers as well (i.e. birthdays) Overall very satisfied yet some issues are as follows: 

(1) No second hand.
(2) Multiple alarms are nice and snooze feature is nice yet alarm tone is a little quiet if you're a deep sleeper.
(3) Backlight is not that great. You need to look hard to see the time. Definitely can't use if driving and want to glance quickly at time.
(4) Databank has 2 pages which have to be scrolled back and forth.
(5) Watch is heavier than the databank/calculator it replaced. Much more stylish though.

I would recommend highly and am looking to buy another one in a different color.  At $20-$30 this watch is a great purchase

Looking for tiny studs for second holes?  These are probably what you are looking for.  They're gold so they won't irritate sensitive ears like the cheap versions the kids always buy. Good price, boxed individually, so you could share them around if you were so inclined.  However since they are small, the prongs can get "pokey" if you sleep on them.

This is a great gift. There is an area for two photos. I gave it to my wife with a photo of myself and my son in it in black and white. She loved it! It was sort of hard to get the photos in, but worth the time. My only complaint is that the locket piece has a tendency to fall off of the chain, but that can be fixed

These earrings dangle about an inch below the earlobe and sparkle prettily as you move.  They are so lightweight that you don't feel them at all.  I purchased them on a Friday sale for $49 and am very pleased with the quality and value.  Handle these earrings very gently, though, as they are quite delicate

This watch is almost perfect. All Casio needs to do is add a light. The dial does glow for a few minutes after exposure to light but not well enough to rely on it when you are really in the dark. Great style though. All other features are wonderful.

I bought my first Casio Divers Watch in 1999 to use in my job as a police ofcr working road patrol. This watch is super tough. I liked the idea of the large easy to read analog dial, and the smaller digital readout that I set to military time as that is what is used for work.

The crystal is pretty good at minimizing scratches. Battery replacement is a little less than two years. Super dependable watch, and tough. Mine have gone through fights, and monthly firearms practice. I never had a single hiccup from any of the two I've worn for work. The watchband does seem to breakdown quickly and will develop cracks and then tear. However, I just replace it with a generic black leather one at a nominal cost.

I'm ordering two more, and am so glad they are still being produced

This is a long-standing standard for a solidly designed well-priced diver's watch.  I have owned this model of watch for several years. The only reason why I get a new one is because my old one gets too beat up from scratches and the like, but not because of any failure.

The mineral crystal is superior for resisting scratches and so much more quality than a cheap plastic type. The stainless steel case looks good and offers rugged protection for the internal components. I have never had a situation where water leaked into the internal part of the watch.

You get the best of both types of displays (analog and digital).  I put the dual time function to use when I travel overseas and don't want to readjust the analog display.

This is a no-brainer if you are in the market for a diver's style watch

This watch has and does everthing, us men need.  Not only does it look kool but it provides a digital and analog display to tell time.  The digital part and wrist band provides the "Sport" look and the Analog with cumpus provides the "casual" look, so therefore you get the best of both sides.

This is an excellent buy for a father, brother, or boyfriend who love a great watch.  If you are looking for something to buy for a love one consider this, its well worth the money

This box is great for the budding watch collector, but be aware that larger men's watches like Seiko Monsters and Tuna Cans, or anything 40mm+ don't fit well in this box. They can be accommodated by storing them loose in a compartment without a pillow, but that tends to defeat the appeal of a storage system of this type. For more average-sized men's and women's timepieces, it's an excellent choice, and the quality is much better than expected at this price point

I have been looking for this exact watch for the past year after the same model that I have had since 1980 died. This watch should last me as long as my first watch that I used to scuba dive in Guam, Spain,The Red Sea, Palua, Japan, Thailand,and several other areas around the world. I have had this watch on as Aircrew on Navy planes for over 6000 flight hours. It has been dropped and banged around more than any watch needs to be and it only failed after 25 years of near constant use. Hope they still make this model in 2031 when I will need it's replacement

What a pretty little necklace. This necklace also comes in Peridot, which I will purchase as well. The stones are beautiful, they really sparkle. They are described as light blue, but they are more a light swiss blue and very vibrant. The chain is fine, but NOT superfine. There are 8 stones stationed set in this necklace. It gives off a lot of sparkle, all around every portion of the front and sides of your neck. It's a lot of "look" for such a dainty, but strong necklace. It matches perfectly with the Swiss Blue Topaz Teardrop Earrings also in the Amazon Collection. The earrings are dainty too, so the look together is balanced.                                                                                                                          This set would be perfect for a bride or anyone who likes really feminine jewelry with a big look.  It is presented in a beautiful midnight blue suede box that is contained in a midnight blue gift box.  The presentation is quite classy looking. No cheap, flimsy gift box, here. You'd feel proud to give this as a gift--like I did--to myself.  Amazon.com always delivers well ahead of their estimated delivery date. This is the fourth piece of jewelry I've ordered from the Amazon collection. I'm very pleased with Amazons collection of jewelry, I'm really liking it. Its priced very well and the quality is even better than I expected from them. Each piece was delivered to me, one day after I received notification of shipment.  I  appreciate the free supersaver shipping.  Thanks again Amazon

The kit is great if you only need to start doing simple repairs and I really mean simple. Don't start pulling springs etc out unless you really know what you are doing and if that was the case you probably would be using more sophisticated and accurate tools anyway. It is a great case for us "want to be " watch maker/repairers. It can soon cover the cost of band repairs and battery replacements by doing it yoursel

At first I thought I was sent the wrong watch because the gold is such a light color-- not at all the brassy gold in the picture. I even went back to my order to make sure it was filled correctly.  When I sat at my computer, near the window, to investigate my order further I saw that the gold was in there, but it is a VERY subtle color gold. I actually like this gold better than the overwhelming gold shown in the picture. I am giving it to my daughter today for her 30th birthday. I hope she loves it as much as I.

My girlfriend loves diamonds and pearls (has quite a few of both, and very nice pieces at that).  I looked through for something to get her for Valentine's day (2007) and of all the items on Amazon this struck my fancy.  It's not her usual fair (white gold, lots of diamonds, old-fasioned pearls, etc) but I just thought it looked very pretty and young/playful.  I took a risk and got her this.

She loved it right when she first got it.  She said it looked to be of decent quality (important, since you can't tell from a picture), and has commented several times on how sparkly the topaz are.  She is not a fan of cubic-zirconia (too sparkly and fake) and loves diamonds (very sparkly).  So this is a good thing.  The blue was also a good color.  I don't know if it matches the picture well, only that she liked it.

The diamonds are tiny and almost not worth it.  I'm not too worried about that, as they add a little bit and are not the focus.  Mainly I thought it to be a well balanced and colorful bracelet.

Definitely recommended

In person this lovely necklace looks even better than the pictures.  It is larger than it looks on the site but it is very striking and looks great on.  However, the ring that it comes with to wear is VERY tight - plan on taking the pendant off the ring and wear it with your own chain.  

It is definitely worth the money, especially since the price dropped

I have received more compliments on this one piece--from *everybody*, even people who don't usually exhibit interest in jewelry or wardrobe--than I have on any other pendant I own.  It is large, but the elongated rectangle shape coupled with the airspace inherent in the design helps to make it not appear too large.  I am petite and I don't have any problems pulling it off.  It's bold, but not aggressive--it has a gentleness, and though it's very contemporary, it has a primitive organic quality.  It looks much more expensive than it is, too--a real *piece of jewelry.*  And I like the neckwire--the pendant never hangs crazy on me and the clasp stays at the back of my neck where it belongs, and it looks graceful on, even with my short neck

Great watch, chunky but if you don't know that you are buying the wrong watch in a g-shock.

Good fit for a wrist that is too big for most standard bands.

Two dings, the hour hand is painted red and not that noticable in low light situations and the first time I wore it in the jacuzzi it reset the whole watch.

To illuminate the second comment, when I got out of the hot tub all the lcd's were blank and the hands were pointing straight up.  I thought I would have to send the watch back.  The next morning it was functioning normally and I've had it in the same and other tubs, showers and pools since.

Great watch, only problem is since the first problem I never know when it will fail again.

FWIW

I was worried because I read the other review after the earrings were already purchased for me and on their way, but when I received them, I was very happy.  Mine really are glass and not plastic and I think they look exactly like the picture.  Every time I have worn them so far I have received a compliment on them.  I am glad that I got them.

This watch as I said, has an excellent design. The size is enough, not too big, not too small.
And for a soccer fan like me it's handy when timing the first and second half.
However, when I got the item, there was no instructions in the box, I had to look for them at Fossil web page, and even so, they're a little bit confusing

Elegant and well executed cufflinks.  The only minor negative is that some edges are a little sharp and cound use a touch up with some very fine sandpaper to round them

Looks like a very expensive watch at only a fraction of the cost. Very classy looking and has all the features of the cheaper appearing watches such as a timer an alarm. Gold and silver contrast each other without looking tacky and the blue face is subtle. Definitely a great bargain

Really, there is nothing more to be said. Do you want some more? Okay, here's the description :two dragons, intertwined with a seal of Solomon in the middle. This necklace is so unique that you are almost guaranteed to be the only one wearing it anywhere except maybe a huge city like New York or London. The detail is exquisite, it looks custom made and the metal looks much more expense than what it is. It honestly looks like something that a medieval mage might had worn. Bravo Silver Insanity!!! This company does amazing work and all should visit its vast selection

I've had this watch for around 18 months now. It's tough, looks good and doesn't have a mark on it yet. It loses out in two places though. Firstly, it has remarkably short "standby" time. Take it off early on a Friday night and then sleep late on Saturday and it's more than likely to have stopped. Take it off for a day to alternate with a dress watch and there's no chance it'll still be going. Secondly - I've been spoiled by electronic watches and not having to adjust the date at month end on 28 and 30 day months so that's a pain. On the other hand, the ripoff prices I have to pay to have the battery in my Citizen changed (along with the mandatory water seal testing) make it well worth the hassle

Had the watch for over a year now. Great design and durable as hell. A little big with dress shirts and runs a little fast. I guess this is normal for automatic watches. This watch is my go to choice for daily wear. Loads of compliments. Basic design, tough, classy. What more could you want out of affordable quality watch. Will buy others in other colors

Works as good or better than my Rolex and Omega watches. I am now certain that Swiss watchmakers are ripping us off by charging thousands for just stamping their name on automatic watches that are marginally superior in fit and finish to this Seiko. For the few weeks that I have been wearing it, it has performed flawlessly. Bravo Seiko

Nice watch, waterproof, never need to mess with a battery like some of my others ie. 2 Tag Heuer's that currently have dead batteries and sitting in my safe.  Then after you change the battery for $50+ a year later it's dead again.  No more batteries for me!  I got a couple Rolex's but they're not appropriate to wear in some of the circles I travel in, unless I want to ask for trouble.  Plus, I bought the wife a Rolex she hardly wore because she was afraid of messing it up ($4k), then it broke and cost $580 to fix!  I got a Suunto that's not bad, plus solar powered Citizen that's good, and some others.  I've taken this watch on some abusive situations like land clearing, chain-sawing wood, lighting 2 acres on fire (controlled burn), construction, and playing lots of piano, stride piano too, so lots of movement, AND not a single SCRATCH, zero.  It will run a couple minutes fast after a while but no big deal.  Lights up great after being exposed to sun, way better that a Rolex or Tag, the only watch to light up better one handed is one I own with Tritium, the radioactive stuff on the dial & hands, but then again the battery is dead, and after changing it a couple time, it's no longer water-proof, it leaked water while diving and now is junk?  Waste of $200.  This Seiko is still on my wrist and haven't had the urge to buy anymore watches, which is a good thing!  No regrets!  It's a keeper

Quick, what's the difference between a higher end Citizen watch and a Tag or Omega or a Rolex?  Price!  Not only is the Citizen watch made to incredibly high standards but it looks outstanding and never needs a battery and all this for a fraction of the price the other watches.  Even with the Citizen price increase on December 1 of last year the Calibre 2100 Titanium and other Citizen models in this price range are ridiculously under-priced.  I currently own four Citizen Eco Drive solar watches and three of them are Titanium models.  I own the gold toned stainless steel Moon Phase watch, the Titanium Nighthawk, Titanium Skyhawk, and the Calibre 2100. They are all superb but I must say that the 2100 is the most impressive of the bunch. The 2100 is also easy to read and operate. So  while my James Bond Omega Seamaster watch sits in a drawer waiting for me to find the time to send it for expensive repairs and my wife's Rolex loses time, my Citizen watches just keep on trucking along!!!

I choose this watch out of all watches under $600 on the web. I have not been disappointed. It is large, solid, and light weight thanks to the titanium. It is one of the nicest watches Citizen makes. The alarm is usable and stopwatch feature is great. The Tachymeter will not do any good unless you are timing something over a hundred miles per hour, but no big deal. Great Watch!

I was looking for a replacement for a casio digital watch which I had for a long time, and felt like getting something I could keep for a while. This watch is seriously better looking in person than the picture given online, and you will not be dissatisfied. It came about 1/4 charged, and took a little more than a week for it to go to full and stay there. It's very easy to read, and I was surprised that it had an alarm on it. It is not the loudest, but still is enough to wake me up in the morning. The titanium band is pretty slick looking, and feeling. I pretty much agree with all the other reviews. Purchasing this watch is one of the best presents I ever got for myself :

The color is vibrant.  It hasn't dulled yet. 

Looking at the chain i could not find any imperfections.

It is very small and very light, hardly noticeable on the skin...just what i wanted.

Ok let me be honest, never wanted to be a pilot(ok maybe a Blue Angel pilot), don't really care about all the functions on the dial; this watch just looks good!  Love it!  Reviews of being to big or heavy scared me a bit, not the case.  This watch screams quality, I've had several comments on it.  Little confusing to set at first, but fine once you get the hang of it. Definitely love the watch for look and quality, backlight is fine when you need it.  Very happy with my purchase

I bought this watch for my deployment to Iraq as a stand-in for my Breitling B-1. Although there's no real comparison between the two for technology and quality of design and manufacture, I will say that the Pulsar is a reasonable substitue in the more austere conditions of Iraq. It's display is a bit dim as mentioned elsewhere but it is still very readable. The alarm is rather quiet. Other functions work as one would expect and I particularly like the one-time alarm function. It looks good on the wrist and keeps reasonable time. I recommend it, particularly with it's low price

Not only did I get this pretty necklace 3 days after ordering it, it is really stunning in person!  It is larger and has more quality than the photo does justice.  Very professional gift packaging too.  

It's a perfect gift for Prinzessin Kat 2005/2006

This is the perfect watch for me. I tend not to take it off very much...so works great for shower etc. Also, very comfortable band and lightweight. I have not used the functions very much on it yet. Also like the size and readability of the display. Definitely, a great watch for a cheap price

From the pool, to the bike, to the run; this watch does it all.  Even when not racing this watch is a great daily wear and easy to navigate through all the options.
Multiple time zones and alarms make it easy as a traveler's watch and fits small wrists nicely

I just purchased my second of these watches (my first being a stainless steel Skyhawk model), and am smitten with these watches, but realistically see the few drawbacks to them.

First, a few selections from the long list of pros.  This watch is extremely durable, and can definitely stand up to the bumps and bruises of daily life.  I've worn this watch everywhere, from work to the gym to the airplane to the beach, and the only time it stopped was when I submerged it in briny sea water, and water somehow got into the watch itself.  It was repaired under warranty, with no problems or questions.  The Eco-Drive power supply is great- save for the rare malfunction or mishap, it doesn't need to be changed.  It'll keep itself fully charged on the fluorescent lighting that we all have at work, or if that fails, it'll charge itself fully within three or four hours of direct sunlight.

The multiple time zone functions are very handy for someone who travels frequently, as I do.  You can simply set another time zone in the digital display, and with the simultaneous pressing of the two buttons on the side of the watch, it'll switch the time displays between the digital and analog displays.  This function is very handy if you're more than one time zone away from home- when I'm traveling in Europe, it's very convenient to be able to tell the time at home with a simple glance as opposed to the mental gymnastics of calculating the time difference.  The slide rule on the crown is also very useful if you want to calculate the arrival time of your flight, or as an amateur pilot, to figure out the amount of fuel you'll use on your flight.  Again, all very useful.

Now, the cons- the watch is large.  I mean, BIG.  If you like large watches, as I do, that's actually a pro, but some people don't really go for that style.  Also, in anything other than the titanium, it's rather heavy too.  There's no forgetting that you have a watch on, although you get used to its heft rather quickly.  Another con would have to be the (sometimes) complex methods of changing the times.  You can't simply pull out the crown and turn, you have to select the correct time zone in the digital display.  It's very precise (which is the upside of this feature), but it's a little time-consuming.  However, it's pre-programmed with Daylight Savings Time, so when the time comes to change the clocks, that's just a simple push of a button.  It just takes a little getting used to, but once you do, you'll never wear another watch.

In conclusion, I'd like to reiterate that this watch is a great timepiece, one that I've just duplicated in my collection (the first watch is my wedding gift, and I can't bear to scratch it again).  I highly recommend this watch to anyone

These earrings are so perfect I have no plans to take them out. I had been shopping for tiny hoop earrings for at least a year, but I never saw what I wanted. Everything I examined was too big or  looked like it would hurt when I slept in them or they'd get caught on the towel when I dried my hair. Recently, I thought of looking at childrens' earrings and began my search with Amazon, not really expecting to find anything. I ordered these on a chance; things rarely look the same in hand as they do online, but the return policy was generous (no 20% restocking fee). Less than a week later, I received earrings that are remarkably sturdy for their diminutive size, were barely noticeable when I slept, and did not snag on the towel.

The only negative aspect to the endless hoop design is that they were incredibly hard to put in with my big, adult fingers! I spent almost 15 minutes struggling on my own until I enlisted a helper. But they are now snugly in place and look perfect. Wish these were available in white gold or platinum

I looked pretty extensively for a Christmas present for my mom. She loves silver dangle earrings, but I kept finding earrings that looked cheap or boring. However, these earrings look wonderful (even better in person) and appear to be great quality. They feel very solid, unlike some earrings I looked at. They shipped very quickly and I was surprised how nice they were for the price

These are solid, durable, adorable earrings. The design is 3 dimensional, so you can wear your hair up or down with them. If mine were eaten by the vacuum cleaner today, I would immediately hop online and buy a new pair.

I haven't worn a watch in years. I wanted to purchase something to go with my business casual dress that would not be too overpowering and still be nice. I had been eyeing this watch for awhile and finally decided to splurge.

The watch seemed to be a bit too flashy for me when wearing blue jeans and t shirts, but that ok with me. The latch seemed to be a little bit tricky at first. Once I read the users manual and figured out how to use it I was ok.

The reason for writing this article was for its durability. I took it on vacation but didn't want to wear it through security checkpoints. I decided I would stick it in a sock and just check the bag. Once I did this and got home I decided I would wash all of my laundry. Of course I forgot and left the watch in the sock. It goes through the washer and dryer, comes out still ticking. No scratches or anything. I'm impressed

This is a very attractive watch - much nicer than the picture depicts. It has a deep blue sunburst dial (much like another Skagen shown on Amazon). It is very slender and the band is a standard double latch design. The band is very easy to adjust(takes a couple of minutes at most).

Besides being accurate (as expected) it has a lot of detail in the dial, (e.g. chrome around the date window) and is easy to view in all lighting situations. But it does not have a light. The large face and numbers on the dial make viewing very easy. Highly recommended

The watch is great, after reading parts of the manual I found there is a low power indicator.  When the second hand moves two seconds at a time the watch is low on power.  I do like the watch, I have two other watches that need batteries ... they are sitting on my dresser (still needing a battery).  I would highly recommend the watch it is a very good value, worry free (no battery to replace) and I think it looks great.  The hour and minute hands are large so they are easy to see

GOOD:

1.Bought it for $139 at 50% off. 

2.I was concerned about the solar battery power. The watch does not get exposed to much sunlight as most of my weekdays are spent inside the office or home. But it has not lost its power so far, looks like it will work fine with tubelight exposure. 

BAD:

1. The watch band pulls my hair. It really gets into my nerve when I am driving or immersed in my work. 

2. It would be nice to have some kind of battery power indicator.
 
3. No perpetual calendar. You have to change the date once for every non-31 day months. And you cannot change it from 9pm to 6am something like that. Weird.


Will not buy it for $275 original price

It looks and performs just as described.  Glow in the dark is good (I prefer an indiglo-type technology though) and the titanium keeps it light.  The only thing that I wanted in this watch that is missing is a little more bulk to it.  It's got a slim profile that was hard to see by the pics, but if that isn't a preference for you then it's no biggie

I previously bought a Citizen Eco-Drive Blue Angels Skyhawk stainless steel digital/analog watch. It was beautiful to look at but hard to read because of the busy dial and the very low contrast digital LCD subdials. I returned the watch and bought the Corso.

Two things about this watch attracted me: (1) the light weight of the titanium case and bracelet, and (2) the easy-to-read dial. I can quickly and easily read off the time, date, and day of the week on this watch. With the Skyhawk, this wasn't possible without reading glasses. 

The bracelet deserves special mention. It does come with a locking pin, and it integrates nicely with the watch case. The titanium finish of the bracelet is unusual. Parts of it are in a brushed/matte metal finish (typically seen in titanium watches), and other parts of the links are highly polished. This makes the bracelet very attractive, but I am wondering whether the titanium bracelet might actually be a combination of stainless steel and titanium.

All in all, this is a great watch at a very attractive price.

Great product! Free shipping (&lt;5 days). I love this watch. I bought another for a Christmas present. $100 less than any jewelry store. Just visit a store, write down the model nimber, and definitely buy from this site (at least $25 cheaper than any other site I found)

This really is good-looking watch. Unlike other bracelet watches I have had, this one does not snag the hair on my arm. The face is slightly smaller than most standard mens watches, which makes a good fit for me because I'm thin. The matte color and dark gray face give a very tasteful look that works for just about any occasion, either dressy or casual.
I liked this watch so much that when I lost the original one I replaced it with the exact model. (I bought the original about 3 years ago in a department store for about $240.)

I've had this watch for roughly 7 years now, and while I absolutely love the look and feel of the watch, I have had to take it to the repair shop at least 5 times over the past 3 or 4 years.

I wear this watch every day, and have taken it in the water and hot tob with me.  The markers (1-12) have continuously popped out, and I have needed to take it to the shop to have them glued back in place (usually under $10).

I plan to buy a second watch to have just in case this happens as I hate being without a watch

I bought this about 5 years ago to have as an every day watch that would look nice. I never had a waterproof watch before, so this has been great! I wear it playing ultimate and sailing. If it gets sweaty, just run it under water and dry it off! Has a few scratches, but still looks great

This is a great, minimalistic watch geared towards those looking for a watch as a fashion accessory. I've received numerous compliments on it, and its slim profile and neutral color make it go great with literally anything.

I've had this for two months now and have yet to see any scratches appear. The timekeeping is accurate (or at least accurate enough that I haven't had to change it yet, except for DST). The double clasp is also very easily adjustable and holds the watch on one's wrist very well.

You won't find a better image-conscious watch for this price.

This watch is quite nice and makes a fashion statement on any arm.  However, the band leaves a little bit to be desired.  While it is an attractive band, it is not as functional as expected.  It does not wrap around the arm securely without turning a bit sideways and showing a bit of the end of the band.  While this is not a severe problem, it is not 100% acceptable

As usual with Amazon it shipped quickly and was half price of the expensive Dept. stores. I love everything about it and have recieved lots of comments about it. The only negative thing I will say it is hard to read day and night.

P.S. It is also very quiet....I have had it for a month and now just listened to it to see if you could even hear it tick

I loved the packaging of this item.  The box was big enough that no one could tell I was receiving jewelry.  They were placed in a small, black bag, completely protected from any damage.  I loved them when I finally opened the bag, and couldn't wait to wear them.  I was immediately given complements at work about my new earrings.

There have been alot of complaints on amazon about similar pieces.  It is very small but no smaller than 14mm as the add states.  I like it small because cameos tend to be a bit gawdy.  I did not get one with diamonds, just plain silver for my mother's gift on valentine's day.  The agate is slightly raised from the setting but does not appear to be a problem, and the design is intricate and nice.  The ring on the pendant could be a little stronger but I think it will be ok.  The chain is very nice and strong.  It arrived on time and I live in Japan.  We love everything with angels on them, we even have a pet or a mutt named Angel.  :-)  I paid $34.00 plus $5.00 shipping and handling and I am ok with that

I agree that the wings are on the transparent side and hard to see, but isn't that what Fairy wings look like?

It was just what I expected with a Disney watch and I am very pleased.  It arrived even quicker than expected.  No regrets at all

I was a bit hesitant about buying this watch as a replacement for my stainless Fossil I've had for many years, but after wearing it for awhile now I'm really happy about the purchase. I'd read that the watch is difficult to read in all but perfect conditions, but I found this to be completely false. I've had no problems whatsoever reading the dial in all sorts of different lighting conditions. 

The other problem I've read about from other reviewers concerned the band, namely the difficulty of adjusting the band and that the band comes undone easily. While it's not the easiest thing to do, I didn't find it to be overly difficult to adjust the band. Within five minutes and a quick look at the Skagen website, where directions are readily available, I had the band at just the right length. I also haven't had any problems with the band coming undone and it feels very secure.

I love these watches and am on my second! I also loved the blue face on this watch. My previous Skagen watch was the traditional white faced. What I do find is quite intriguing is that I received more compliments with the white faced watch than the blue: Go figure. Do you wear a watch for your own pleasure or the pleasure of others? Maybe both. I do like the black faced watch but heard that the black wears off the watch band. I could see me buying both a white and black faced Skagen to go along with this watch. As you can easily see, I am a fan of these watches

From first glance, I knew this would be a good buy.  Some people may frown on the steel look, but the way this bracelet was put together is nothing short of excellent.  Doesn't bind, bend or twist in odd directions.  Firm and solid.  Fits exactly as they say it does.  A must buy from Sabrina Silve

I saw these listed in a friday sale and couldn't pass them up. They are about the size of a thumb-tack (the flat, smaller side) and are brilliant blue in color. They are really light, delicate (yet solidly built) and are a great deal. The only possible issue I have is that the setting is higher than I expected and the base of the post is small in diamater (bigger bases sit better on your earlobe). But if that doesn't bother you, these earrings are a fine addition to any collection. Two thumbs up, I'm very happy with my purchase.

  I feel that this watch, and its rectangular brother the EFA120D1AV, are attractive, well-built, feature-filled watches, that sell for a reasonable price. I've seen several posts in which people complain about the darkness of the LCD. However, the use of a black inverse LCD is common among many manufacturers. This use of such a subtle LCD in an analog/digital watch makes the watch look much more elegant than analog/digital watches that use a bright/contrasty LCD in the background. The result is that the analog hands stand-out quite clearly from the LCD in the background, yet the information on the LCD can still be read when desired. This watch manages to present an elegant sophisticated, yet sporty look, while providing a lot of information and functionality. I'm quite pleased with my purchase and only wish it had been easier to choose between this watch and the similar EFA120D1AV

I bought this watch for my husband for Christmas and was so impressed with all of the functions that I ended up giving it to him early and buying him something else for Christmas. We had to get it sized, so if you have small wrists, plan on that. But for the price, this watch absolutely rules. It has so many functions that it is hard to learn at first, but it comes with a little booklet that explains everything

I DID NOT EXPECT THAT CASIO PRODUCES SUCH GOOD QUALITY WATCHES. THIS WATCH IS ACTUALLY BETTER THAN IT SEEMS IN THE PHOTO. IT IS SHINNY AND VERY HEAVY. THATS A VERY GOOD MANUFATURING PRODUCT. BEAUTIFUL AS IT COMBINES ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL READINGS. AND I AM SURE THAT THIS WATCH WILL LAST FOR A LIFE AS ALL MY OTHER CASIO WATCHES WHICH I BOUGHT WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND STILL ARE WORKING. NOT TO MENTION THE PRICE FOR SUCH A FANTASTIC WATCH. JUST 50 DOLLARS? IN GREECE WE SAY "DON'T EVEN SAY IT TO THE PRIEST

I've always wanted to have this item but wasn't sure if i should purchase one through the internet but still i decided i should give it a shot since amazon is known for great shipping and handling . . . I was very pleased upon receiving the product not just it was on time but it was exactly how they described it on the description of the item.  Will definitely purchase again here in amazon and will look forward for my next shopping experience

I love my Bulova watch.  I was looking for a women's watch that would stand out a little more than the average watch and this one does it for sure!  It looks great and has just enough sparkle without being too much.  It is a larger watch than many women's but the detail and the design make it look very feminine.  I have small wrist, so I had to remove four links from it, but it looks great and is not overpowering.  I don't think I have taken it off since it arrived!

On the price - I had been looking at this watch for 3 months.  Amazon was hundreds cheaper than everyone else.  Many places are selling if for $369 to $499.

My Husband actually purchased this for me for Christmas.  My previous watch was a Bulova.  It was 12 years old, with two clasps and only 3 battery replacements!  This new one had a lot to live up to.  It certainly exceeded my expectations.  I love this new design, and the size is perfect.  It is a little larger without being too bulky.  The diamonds around the face are just enough bling without looking tacky.  I get a lot of compliments on my new watch.  Bulova is certainly my first choice

When I first saw this necklace, I considered it one of the best amazon had to offer, as usual I assumed it would not be as great as the image made it out to be and I was right. First of all, it was smaller then it looks on the picture here, but more importantly, on my copy, one of the indentations that line the inside of the dragons was missing. But don't get me wrong, it's just a small imperfection, I still think it's a great desig

Quite the conversational piece. A good buy for dragon lovers or Celtic "fiends". A small historical reference to "second sight" makes the silver piece more appealing at least to me.........

I bought this necklace on a whim; I love butterflies and it looked so dainty and sweet. It was actually a little more weighty than I expected, although it's not a solid piece. The chain is shiny and nicer than I expected.

The pendant was much bigger than I was expecting. It's very difficult to find an outfit that this necklace will go with because of the oversized pendent, I haven't been able to wear it much. The quality of the beads is good, the pendant is sort of plastic feeling but you have to touch it to notice. The cord everything is strung on is very cheap.

Nice peice if you really want to make a statement and no one's going to look too close

I LOVE THIS WATCH.  I WAITED UNTIL I OWNED IT FOR SEVEN MONTHS BEFORE WRITING THIS RERVIEW. IT KEEPS GREAT TIME AND BY LEAVING IT NEAR A WINDOW AT NIGHT, IT CALABRATES WITH FT. COLLINS. UNLIKE THE AUTOMATIC WATCH I PREVIOUSLY OWNED, IT DOESN'T STOP.  THE EARLY MORNING SUNLIGHT IT RECEIVES NEAR THE WINDOW IS SUFFICENT TO KEEP IT WORKING WELL. I WOULD HAVE RATED IT FIVE STARS EXCEPT FOR ONE FACTOR. THE SMALL WINDOW NEEDED TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS IS DIFFICULT TO SEE. I LOST THE MANUAL AND DON'T KNOW HOW TO ADJUST TIME CHANGES ( THE WATCH DOES THIS AUTOMATICALLY BUT ONLY ON THE DAY AFTER YOU GO FROM DAYLIGHT TO STANDARD TIME)AND TIME ZONE CHANGES.  I ASSUME THAT I WILL BE ABLE TO GET THE INFO FROM CASIO.  UNFORTUNATELY, THE MANUAL IS NOT IN AMAZON'S DIGITAL LIBRARY. I PAID $80 FOR IT ON AMAZON AND IT IS A STEAL AT THE CURRENT PRICE.  IF IT WAS EASIER TO READ THE INFO IN THE WINDOW, THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN RATED A 5 EVEN AT THE HIGHER PRICE THAT I PAID

I bought my first Wave Ceptor several years ago.  I got a good deal on it but the plastic band broke about a year ago and it is designed so it could not be replaced unless you sent it back to Casio.  I learned from that one.  These watches keep perfect time and this band is REPLACABLE.  The looks of this watch are terrific with the gold ring around the blue field.  Yes, it only has the day displayed, but if you become familiar with the buttons, you can find all of the other information.  Besides, if you don't know the month and the year, you need more help then this watch can give you.  This is a great deal on this watch. Almost half price.  I am happy.

Originally written for the Orange Monster, this review holds equally true for the black version.

From the moment you first hold this watch in your hand, you realize it is a quality timepiece. The first thing that strikes you is its large size and heavy feel, yet despite that, it feels comfortable on the wrist due to its fine balance.

BRACELET:
The bracelet end links (those that attach to the watch case) are solid rather than formed sheet metal like you will find on most other watches in this price range. The pins holding the bracelet to the watch are the sturdiest I have ever seen. Each of the bracelet's subsequent links is also made from a solid piece of steel, not folded sheet, each component being feather-edged to prevent it digging into the wrist. Its removable link pins are of an unusual machined pin and collar design which, though fiddly to remove and replace, nevertheless ensure that the pins remain under-flush and secure when correctly installed. The bracelet is perfectly flush on the side that contacts your wrist making it feel very smooth during wear.
The clasp is very high quality, having both a fold over security buckle, which deploys with a satisfying click, and an Omega style double button catch. The security buckle closes onto a spring pin whose ends are spherical thus ensuring a tight fastening which should not wear with use. All in all these features add up to a watch that is very quiet on the wrist, the only faint sound coming from its automatic winding mechanism.
Finally the bracelet incorporates a clever hidden diver's extension (to allow the watch to be worn over a wet suit).

CASE:
The watch case, back and bezel are made from stainless steel. The case has an attractive mix of polished, brushed and machined finishes which all add to the feel of quality and function. The overall impression is that this is a precision instrument rather than a fashion piece; that's not to say though that it would look out of place with a dinner jacket any more than a wet suit.
The unidirectional bezel is of a heavily scalloped design, protected by bezel-guards which extend upwards from each of the lug pairs. The lower guard also functions as a crown guard and, all in all, the impression is of a case machined from a solid billet of steel. The bezel sits slightly higher than the domed crystal, thus providing protection from scratching and the crystal itself is of a proprietary Seiko material "hardlex" which, as I understand it, is better at resisting scratches than mineral glass but less susceptible to shattering than sapphire.
The luminosity of this watch is astounding due partly to the use of Seiko's proprietary "lumibrite" paint but also to the large coated areas on the hour markers and hands.
The bezel only turns one way, as a safety feature for timing dives, and feels silky smooth, the best I've experienced on any Seiko or Invicta diver. It has 120 clicks per revolution and is nicely aligned with the face.

MOVEMENT:
The watch uses the 21 jewel Seiko 7S26 movement running at 21,600 bph (5 ticks per second). It is non-hacking which means that the second hand does not stop when the crown is pulled out. Although this makes it difficult to synchronize, if a slight backward pressure is applied to the fully extended crown, it is possible to stop the second hand. The watch can not be hand wound but the self winding mechanism is very efficient and I have found that it has a power reserve of at least 24 hours. The 7S26 has been around for many years and has a reputation for ruggedness and reliability.

ACCURACY:
There are several reviews where people complain of poor accuracy. Typically, when new, automatic movements will be set to run fast at the factory because they tend to slow down after a few weeks of use. I own three watches with the 7S26 movement and after their breaking in period all are now keeping time to within 10 seconds per day.
I have a few thoughts on accuracy. You have to ask yourself how accurate does your watch need to be? If it is running 10 or 20 seconds fast per day then set it one minute slow and you will only need to re-set it once every week or two when it has advanced to one minute fast. If you need more accuracy then, unless you are willing to pay at least five times as much for a swiss watch, then buy a quartz.

Finally, if you do a search on the Seiko Monster you'll quickly come to realize that in its various colours, these watches are firm favourites amongst those who are members of internet watch forums. I would highly recommend that you purchase one and see for yourself

Let me start by stating that Amazon prices are the best for this product. I also kept the free shipping (3 - 5 days), and received the monster in three days from the purchase date.

This time piece is awesome. I'm a avid watch collector and have had my eye on the one for a few months. A friend of mine purchased the Orange Monster and I had to have one too. I opted for the Black Monster with the rubber dive band; more my style. I can say without a doubt that I am very impressed. There are a lot of compliments to go around too. Everyone who sees it wants to check it out closer, try it on and/or ask where I bought it. Nice balance, accurate, attractive, and very, very large.

I received the Seiko "Black Monster" and basically the photos don't do it justice.This is a very big and bold watch and it seems that all the reviews I've read are positive.The price is such a steal on this watch,and it's very competitive with other diver's watches costing 2 or 3 times the price tag.I picked up the one with the stainless steel bracelet (which is a work of art itself).The only complaint I have is with the time frame  for the delivery...I selected the 1 day shipping feature for an additional $14.98 but it took almost 3 days to get here.It was no big deal... but it should have been more clear when I was ordering.  There was a little note that stated "If ordered within the next 2 hours you  get 1 day shipping"

There is far too much metal for the stone thats there.  Although this shouldn't pose a problem for those seeking some serious accessories, I was disappointed as the pictures gave me the impression that it was far more stone than metal.

This pendant is very pretty, but it's not quite what I expected.  The dimensions are given as 3/4 inch high and wide, but I was picturing it a bit larger.  I also thought the chain would be more robust, but it is very fine.  It is packaged in a cheap felt bag inside a cardboard box.  These are not bad things, and I do like the necklace, but I thought I'd put down my misconceptions to help others make a decision.  Overall the product seems to be of very good quality

This is a great watch made by Seiko for the lowest possible price for a fashion watch.  It is pink and silver with a clever band.  I love the rhinestones.  I bought this watch with another one just as nice for $11!!
You can hunt all over the internet and not find a bargain like this!  The band was a little tight so I used a removeable link from another watch I had.  Presto!  Two great, fun to wear watches
