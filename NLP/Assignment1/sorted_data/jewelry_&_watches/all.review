 I bought this watch for my husband, but didn't take the time to read the description carefully.  So it's my fault I had to send it back. He is in the Army and leaving soon for Iraq.  I thought this sturdy watch would be a perfect gift.  Unfortunately it does not work if you're more than 2,000 miles from Colorado. If you are not going to leave the continental United States I suppose it would be a good watch

These earrings were very uncomfortable.  I'm not sure if it's actually the size of the post so much as the shape and angle--more like an angled bar than a round post.  I don't have particularly sensitive ears, although I generally don't wear large or heavy jewelry, either.  These earrings are on their way back to Amazon.

I also wasn't thrilled to see how much the price has varied.  When I ordered--4/6/07--they were $34.99.  Some reviewers bought them for less, yet the current price seems to be even more.

Caveat Emptor

I was very disappointed in these earrings.  They were only about the size of a nickel, and for $50 I expected them to be as large as earrings I have found from several other merchants for the same price.  If you are looking for average size hoops -- say the size of a quarter -- these are NOT the earrings for you.  I can only imagine how tiny the $30 pair is

My 5-year-old daughter was thrilled with her locket. It is really beautiful. We were both quite disappointed, however, when the locket itself broke...the loop that attaches to the bail completely came off. She is a normal kid, but was not overly rough with the necklace. It is currently at the jeweler's to be fixed

We bought this locket for my daughter, and had it personalized with her initials on one side, and the year on the other.  This is such a small locket, that it will be very hard to put a picture in it.  Also, the locket is very, very hard to open.  The top of the heart wasn't closed all the way, so the locket kept falling off the chain, we had to have it fixed.  Now it stays together, my daughter loves it and wears it every day, but I would have bought a different locket if I had realized how small this is, and that we would have to do some repairs on it before it could be worn

The locket on this cable chain is so tiny, you will not be able to put a picture in it.  After opening the box and being completely disappointed, I opened the locket to see how it worked.  It would not close properly after opening.  The quality of this necklace is not good - do not waste your money.

These were nice earings, which I received as a gift off my wish list.  But after I wore them about 3 or 4 times, one of them fell out and is now lost.  The post does not stay in place very well.  I am frustrated because I put these on my wish list because they are advertised as having an "innovative clasp" which avoids lost earings.  But they did not work well for me.    
By the way, after I first wrote this review, I called Amazon to complain.  They sent me another pair right away at no charge.  This suggests to me that others have complained in the past.  I appreciate that they were so responive.

This is way too small for a men's watch, both the face and the band -- the band wouldn't even go around my wrist.  I think this must be a women's watch mislabled.  Nice looking, but I sure can't use it -- I'm going to have to return it

I bought this tool after reading all of the glowing reviews. I thought this would be a good way to save money by sizing my watches, rather than paying $10 each time to have a professional do it. I was so disappointed in this tool. The link remover only pushes the pins out halfway. You are instructed to take a pair of tweazers to pull the pin out the rest of the way. As you can imagine this is not easy. My husband ended up scratching my watch as he struggled to pull the pins out. Knowing what I know now, I would definitely have invested in a different link remover

The product pretty much snapped in half while I was trying to remove two links from one watch.  The other one I tried before this one didn't fit in the adjustment piece at all.  So with that said, do not buy this product at all.  It's very poorly made and terribly annoying to use.  Instructions are very unclear.  I ended up throwing it away and going to a watch shop to get it fixed

This supposedly "new" item looked like it had been either used a few times or someone had left it out in the rain.  It arrived with the one-page instruction sheet wrapped around the plastic tool.  The silver knob that you can see on the left side of this "tool" was rusted and would not turn very easily.  I'm not sure how this tool is effective in removing stubborn watch band pins.  Maybe this tool is effective in only removing pins from cheaply manufactured watches - much like this item.  When I attempted to use it, the entire plastic body would flex and I was afraid that it would snap if I twisted the knob any further.  Not worth the sale price that it was advertised.  The most effective way of using it was to remove the knob and pin from the apparatus and gently tap the end with a hammer in order to loosen the pins.  This is definitely not worth the sale price

I had loved it at first, but I am one to leave a necklace on forever. It started to get all kinked up and I couldn't figure out how to straighten it out. But the company did offer me a discount on a different chain, even though it was past their 30 day policy. Nice for once in a while wearing and be careful when handling it

for $10 these were too good to pass up.  First noticed that the gold balls are glued or welded into the stem.. the earring is not all one piece.  First time I wore them, lost one because the back slipped off though they weren't tugged or snagged to cause the earring to pop out.   

This is the second pair I bought... first set was fine.  Seems like the quality of construction may be slipping   (or a different supplier?)

Though the design is cool, the quality of this pendant is poor.  They are so light and the color is strikingly white, which makes them appear cheaper.  They look like toys!  I also bought the earrings set with the same design and I'm so disappointed with both.  :-(  Only the packaging is of good quality in this product.

I suggest that amazon collection makes white gold of a good quality with the similar design.

Though evenly matched, the color of the amethysts are much lighter than the product image. Both stones are feathered in areas and have visible blemishes though these aren't apparent if you are wearing them. About the quality you'd expect from Mervyn's or Sears on sale. Not terrible, but not great

The color of the actually received ear rings was quite light. A darker amethyst color would have been much better and the picture on the computer screen was really deceptive, since that showed a much darker colored amethyst. I won't buy jewelry from Amazon again when it comes to a colored stone. HSN depicts their jewelry much better on the screen and provides better stone quality products

There two major problems with this watch. One, Auto-atomic setting do not work as described in manual. Second, Unable to even set time using good old fashion manual way. Returned to Casio for repair, hope they get it right

If you check out the page you find this "womens" watch for $133.99 you will also find the "mens" version for just $98.00. Why would this be? If anthing because of the gold plating and the mens watch being much larger, it would cost more to make the mens watch. More size, more gold, more gold, higher price to make. Another little thing that bothers me is both watches are shown together with a little "better together" hook. Better for who? There is not once cent in discount for buying together.

I own an Invicta and have had no trouble with it. I would buy the pair for my wife and I. But, I am not going to toss out an extra $35.99 for the womens watch just because Invicta and/or amazon feel they can charge more for if anything a product that would not cost as much to make.

Man, it seems that the women would really get hot over this

Fair warning--had I had the benefit of some of the reviews that have since appeared about this company's watches, I never would have bought one.  Do yourself a favor and read the reviews for the various models before wasting your money.  The percentage of watches that work for any length of time is distressingly low

I was very excited to get these earrrings for my daughter for Christmas, however upon opening found that one of the front of the earrings was dented.  Now I need to return them.  Other than the dent, they were cute. Even though they were only $25.00, there should be some quality control by the manufacturer

I love the actually pendent the time it got there was great. But I really didn't like how they show the pendent on a chain because I bought it for the whole package (chain included). So when I got it I was SHOCKED that it didn't included it. So buyers beware this supplier doesn't give you the actually chain which can cost you up to and extra $15-$30 even thou they adversities it in their ad.

I purchased this watch for my granddaughter as her first watch.  However, it never worked.  I don't know if it had a dead battery or if it's broken.  The cost to replace the battery will be nearly as much as I paid for the watch.  I will try to resolve the issue with Amazon

The earrings are nice & a great value at $30. However, the posts are too thick for my liking and make my ears sore. The posts are not the typical size one might find in US stores. The posts are more typical of earrings that I have purchased in Central & Southern America; in fact, this is where the earrings were made. I returned them

This ring does NOT look as pictured.  It arrived today (almost 3 weeks after I ordered it) and is extremely thin, has tarnish marks, and the metal filigree on the crown shows up only in random places.  It looks like it came out of a vending machine and I'm obviously pretty disappointed.  I won't be buying anything from this vendor again

This bracelet is silver TONED, not sterling silver. The embossing is also not the greatest - clear on the one side, but hard to see the letters on the other

 First of all I would like to mention that the Invicta brand,that exists and produces watches nowadays,has nothing to do with the Swiss company that bears the same name,but went into bankruptcy a few decades ago.The actual Invicta company is an american one and has bought the rights to use this name.
 The mechanisms are Swiss made or made in Japan.About the ones made in Switzerland I cannot post an opinion.This particular model(9211),which I purchased this year,has a japanese mechanism(Made by Myota I think).Every 24 hours it loses some precious seconds,so,after a few days it becomes a matter of minutes.In conclusion it has a problem with precision,beeing unable to keep time with accuracy.
 I would advise anyone who wants to buy this watch to think twice.Of course the discount price is attractive but the watch doesn't meet it's expectasions;I consider that a "minimum" dose of accuracy is required.The only good aspect about this watch is it's appearance.
 Learn from other's mistakes...

This watch looks good but the movement is terrible. I got this watch as a Christmas gift but the 24 hour register was synchronized to the hour hand. I must warn you, if you purchase this watch then don't be suprised if it doesn't work right. It may look like a Rolex but it doesn't work like one

The clip holds the money, but the credit card holder is a bit scary.  It just doesn't work that well.  Plus, it is very heavy.  If you put 5 bills in there, even without the credit cards, this thing is like putting a brick in your pocket.  I would not recommend it

As title says.  There were kind of a "water mark" on the face of the watch, maybe a leak from the solar panel?  I did not exchange for another one because it is a cheap watch, no point paying shipping back and forth.
Anyways the instructions were easy to understand, buttons on the side a little bit hard to push.  Blue LED on red face looks bad, because of the dark face for the solar panel it is not easy to see.  This watch is now sitting on my desk collecting dust, I am just waiting to see when the solar panel stop leaking and the watch fail

This watch was a disappointment; it has a huge dial, but the chronograph functions are extremely tiny.  It's also an extremely "flashy" watch - the image on the web-site makes it look classy - not so.  Additionally, the watch is completely useless under low light conditions - it neither fluoresces, nor does it have a light-up function.  Returned it after a week, got my money back

Nice looking but with very serious design and/or manufacturing flaw - after LESS THAN 2 month of use in office environment glass CRACKED WITHOUT ANY IMPACT whatsoever. Now I'll have to find out if Skagen's customer service is any good. For $70 watch I certainly expected better quality.
After reading other reviews for this models I realized that many other people had the same issue. 
BOTTOM LINE -AVOID!!

These diamonds shouldn't be offered in this size for jewelry.  The imperfections in them seriously hinder the sparkling characteristics a diamond is known for.  Great price - but you get what you pay for

I bought these for my young daughter. I understood the basics of diamond ratings and wasn't concerned with the inclusions they may have contained. I expected low quality stones with some particles visable to the naked eye. What i didn't expect was the cloudiness. Although these weren't yellow in color they were the absolute worst pair of diamonds i had ever seen. There was  no clarity just two milky looking stones. These diamonds should have been grinded and used for diamond dust or chips only

I can see why they are priced so low, I figured that they would look like the photo, or something like it but the ones I received are very cloudy.  I guess you get what you are paying for.  As for the K clarity, I have no idea what that is so I never thought they would look this bad

By the time he looked at it there was no way for us to return it for a refund. Not happ

As per the review, I decided to buy the item. I received it. It was very thick and ugly looking. It just looks good in the picture. As mentioned by someone, it has plastic back cover which makes it worse. It also is very large and long. So to remove the small braces cost more. Overall unhappy and returned to AMAZON with loss of money in shipping

It was larger than I expected from the images, thicker too. In my opinion it didn't look as classy as the picture made me believe.

I was very disappointed that the regular second hand was NOT in fact the large sweeping thin hand, that's actually only for the stop watch. The regular second hand is one of the gimmicky minature dials in the middle.

Really, with the extra bulk and my dislike of which hands were which, and the cheaper look of the watch in person, I never actually put it on before sending it back

These were on my mom's wishlist, so I bought them.  They just arrived and I'm totally disappointed.  I'd return them if it wouldn't cost me and I wasn't so lazy.  

They look pretty darn cheap, for starters.  Also, they came in a little, plastic zipper bag inside of a little, pseudo-velour bag, with a price tag for $3.30 on it.

Save your money.  It's best not to buy jewlery sight unseen

The Topaz earring is nice enough and probably worth $45, but be aware that it is smaller than it looks on the web page. The shaft that hangs between the two stones is about 5/16" long; the larger stone is about 3/16" wide and 1/4" high; the small stone is about 3/32" wide. Essentially, you get what you pay for

I bought this to help change the leather strap on a beautiful watch.  The v-notched end was too thick to fit - I used my pocket knife instead.  Maybe there's a "knack" to it, but I didn't want to scratch my watch while practicing.
The pointed end works very well for pressing in those tiny spring bars and the small, recessed auto-set buttons for which a ball-point tip is too big and a needle is too clumsy. But you probably have something around the house that would work just as well (mini-screwdriver, the point of a phillips head...

I was very disappointed with how tiny this eternity cross is.  I don't know if the measurements were in the description for it or not, or if they were and I just didn't see or pay attention to them, but this cross is so tiny it really seems like it's meant for a very young child.  The necklace may be 18", but the pendant itself was so small, not at all what I was looking for.  So i'm going to give this as a gift for a niece.  What I was really wanting was a larger, heavier duty sterling silver eternity cross as a slide for an omega chain for an adult.  Never have found one yet.

My order arrived quickly but upon FIRST use, the clasp broke on this necklace.  Since it wasn't an expensive item, I joined the ends together with a small wire ring I already owned, since it would have cost more to send the item back and have replaced...perhaps with another faulty item.  As they say, "you get what you pay for!

I recieved it promptly, but it didn't work. I took it to Walmart to get a battery and they recommended going to a jeweler. I did that, buying a battery for twenty dollars and still cannot get the time to set right. I've read the manual over and over. My sons did the same. It looks nice but doesn't work and its been very aggravating. I wouldn't recommend it

I got this as well under the assumption that it wasnt a high end watch.  After wearing Invicta's for a while this feels like a gum wrapper on my wrist.

When I received it, I noticed the small scratches all over the crystal.  Nothing deep, but they really pick up the glare. 

Atomic signal, I am unable to get it to pick up one.  In Memphis, TN, I think I should be in range, and all my atomic clocks sync up fine.  I have tried it facing 4 different directions and also tried it outside to eliminate any interference from the house.  Still no good.

Basically I spent 30 dollars for a cheap watch that doesnt even have a backlight.  Lesson learned

I bought these for my mom, she was very excited about them when looking at the picture online, when they arrived they turned out to be a big disappointment.

The entire earring is tiny, the pink stones so small they hardly stand out against the silver, from not very far away at all, they just look like a gray blob, very hard to tell what shape. Not impressed, I suggest you look for something else.

I will be returning these immediatel

Here is an example of the deception of photos on the net. The smallest photo they showed of these earings was 4x larger than the actual product!!
We had to put them on our 9 month old grandaughter, and even then they still appeared tiny on her baby ears!! Rip off, never buy jewlery from amazon again!

I have owned several timex ironman watches over the years. Loved 'em all. I don't if amazon sent me one with an almost dead battery, or if it's a flaw in the watch. However, when punching through the modes, everything is REALLY SLOW. If I go to alarm, I have to wait a few seconds for it to appear, then wait a few more when I choose to modify it. Not quick an easy like my other ironmans. Great features though, if it wasn't for this annoying delay, 5 stars easy.
So I don't know to blame amazon or timex for this. Either way, it is a problem that dropped the score for me

It might just be REALLY bad luck, but after three fossil watches (1 x blue, 2 x titanium), I've never managed to make them last more than two years each. They are really cool, look great and the price is reasonable. But this is the third time Fossil lets me down. And to get them repaired through the warranty is extremely painful.

This time I'm looking for another brand as I feel I'm wasting my money

"I bought this watch as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend, after 2 weeks, the round thing on top of the watch came off. 
The seller says it has to be sent to repair..and it will take 3 to 5 weeks to get back. I am so embarassed of the poor quality gift I chose and can't belive they will not replace it ..with an apology...their answer is just not acceptable."
But there is nothing else I can do but write this review, I have two fossil watches myself and after the good reviews I read I was happy with the gift..but now ...I am so disapointe

I bought these for my 83 year old mom, she loves jewelry and helped me pick these out. We thought it would be a good deal for the price. She was happy with the look of the stones when they arrived, but as others have noted, these stones are mounted at the end of a rather deep mount (almost 1/4 inch) which makes them rather top heavy. Unless you have very thick and meaty ear lobes, these earrings are going to droop downwards, not sit pretty on your ear as you would expect. Needless to say, my moms ear lobes are very thin, as soon as she put them in her ears, they drooped downward at a 45 degree angle. She was very displeased with these and we sent them back for a refund

This watch stinks.  Crappy manual, the band is so big it could fit around my leg, and when I received it, IT DIDN'T WORK.  Now I have to pay extra to fix the band AND to get it working.  So much for what I thought was a nice looking inexpensive watch. I would've given it no stars if I could. DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID - AVOID THIS WATCH

I work in a bank where every year each of the branches does a stupid secret Santa thing around Christmas time.  I bought this as a gift for the guy I got stuck with.  

The thing comes in a nondescript box and looks like a paper clip.  If I had given this as a gift, people would have thought I raided the supply closet at work for a present.  Total garbage

I got the watches as party favors for my 10year old party guests, but none of the kids or I have been able to reset it. My daughter has been frustrated with it and says some of her friends she inquired from had the same issue with the watch. The 2 little knobs can't be manipulated as indicated on the accompanying  instruction sheet. Needless to say the watches are beautiful and attractive, but if kids for whom they were made can not reset them and use  them then the purpose is defeated. The service was great, but  the product is unsatisfactory.

I love the size (small) and quality of these earrings that were ordered for my 6 year old.  The website picture shows them as a blue and purple color.  When I got them they were pink and green, even the replacements they sent were pink and green.  I have not been happy with their customer service on these and will not order jewelry again.

I bought this for my daughter. The display was dead when it arrived. I took it a local jewelry counter for a new battery, and the live battery let some display show, but it was a garbled display and not able to be set or used. My daughter found a much cheaper watch at Target, with more features (a stopwatch!).  This one wasn't even worth sending back

I bought this ring for my girlfriend and 2 months later it completely fell apart.  The bands on the ring actually broke apart and piece by piece the ring crumbled.  Poor quality, I am not sure if it relates the thin bands that construct the puzzle ring, or the fragile nature of the metal.  I wish I had my 25 bucks back

I bought this ring for my fiance, since i have one, and it's a terrible ring.  We got it apart, and then.....have not been able to get it back together, it's been over a month now, we went online to get the directions, that didn't help either. Plus, the ring is so cheap, it warmed up with the effort from our hands and bent out of shape. It is cheap and completely useless.

I didn't feel it was necessary to read the reviews before I purchased the watch~ this is Disney and Tinker Bell!. The word "Flirt" didn't bother me either because Tinkerbell was a flirt.   Wow after reading the full product description with hot and saucy on the wrist band I was shocked that this watch is under the children's section. I needed this for my grand daughter's birthday. Like it was said before, I could have given this five stars but HOT and Saucy for a young girl, oh no

To much trouble to send back, but arrived with a dead battery.
Ended up getting another gift and still carry watch around in trunk to get a battery put in it. Watch looks nice - but it would be nice if it worked

Having read the other reviews I expected something small, but decent.  The particular pair I received had two defects: 1. one of the back clasps was bent so that it could not provide the correct tension on the post for reliable wear and 2. one of the stones had a very large, visible black inclusion near the top.  It was visible to my naked eye (I don't have a jeweler's loupe) even though it was partially hidden behind one of the mounts.  Maybe I just got a bad pair, but given those two problems and the small size of the stones, I sent them back and did not try again.

I bought these for my wife for Christmas 2005. By August 2006 one of them fell apart. The gold loop is attached to the white gold loop by a very tiny and fragile weld, which broke. It was not due to any abnormally rough handling. It would have cost $50.00 to have repaired. Now they're throw-aways

I was extrememly unhappy with this necklace.  The picture on-line makes it look beautiful with light shining thru the amethyst (ha, looks like cut glass not real amethyst!)/Even putting it up to the natural light it looked dull/fake/plastic.  I emailed and got a reply I would get a full discount just mail it back.  Well, I mailed it back with insurance costing $6.55 after already paying shipping to have it sent to me.  Because I feel it was NOT advertised in a 'correct light' I asked for my shipping back for both charges and disputed the charge with my credit card company.  The refund from Amazon was only the cost of the necklace with neither shipping charge.  I am still going to dispute the the shipping charges because this jewelry did NOT look like it did on the website

LOOKED GOOD ON ME THIS WATCH BUT I FOUND OUT JUST IN TIME THAT THIS DID NOT CARRY SEIKO'S REGULAR TWO OR THREE YEAR WARRANTY SINCE IT IS A GREY MARKET WATCH. HAVING READ THE MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS SEIKO MONSTER I DECIDED I NEEDED A WARRANTY. SO FOR THIS SIMPLE REASON I HAD TO RETURN IT TO AMAZON RIGHT AWAY AND AM IN THE PROCESS OF EXCHNAGING IT WITH ANOTHER BRAND THAT DOES HAVE WARRANTY.

When I first got this watch I was thrilled.  It has a nice movement and has very powerful illumination.  The problem started when I went to the store to get the bracelet sized for my puny wrists.  The guy asked me if this was some kind of overstock or gray market, because the pins in the bracelet popped out like nothing.  At the time I thought he was just po'd because I didnt buy the watch at the store.  As soon as I was home though the bracelet fell apart.  What a piece of junk!  I regret buying this watch and I advise against it.

Very disappointed in the watch and Amazon. The day/date did not work on delivery but I was unaware of it until the end of February when I tried to manually change the date. I found that it was broken at that time, about a week after I received the watch. The day/date did change automatically each night. Amazon refused t orepalce it because I had the band adjusted. Seiko refused t oreplace it but said they would repair it and have it back to me in 3-4 weeks! Had I purchased it from a REPUTABLE local store I could have exchanged it for a new watch.

I DIDN T KNOW THESE WATCHES WERE MADE IN SINGAPORE. MAYBE THIS IS WHY MY " MONSTER" DOESN T WORK. WHO KNOWS ,,,,,,,TOKE TO AUTHURIZED DEALER FOR REPAIR . HE WANTED $ 175.   DONT BUY SEIKO,,,,,,,

Pardon me if I also wish to review anonymously. I now can come forward with my negative experience with the Seiko Black Monster too after seeing a handful of other ex-owners post theirs. I had my Seiko Black Monster SKX779K1 for about three weeks when it also did a freeze of all its movements and sounds. No sweep motion, no tick-tock of any sort. But unlike someone else's experience, mine never sprang to life anymore. AFter I shook it gently sideways to wind it up, its second hand moved for only about 10-12 seconds then stopped again. I did this "Watch CPR" several times but still always failed to resucitate it. My watch also was forming a light miss on the inside of its crystal a day after I used in while doing the dishes of all things. This is a divers watch? I already packed it up last Thursday for return and dropped it off at my local USPS, and Im still thinking whether to give it a chance and get another Black Monster or to get an entirely different model or brand. I must day that I am DISAPPOINTED BIG TIME in this watch! I loved the way it looked and it really made me felt bad to return it. But to me a watch is an instrument first, an accessory only second.

I orginally purchased this for myself when it was $10.  As soon as I received it I went to put it on and it broke right away.  I was very disappointed so my boyfriend purchased another one for me for $10.  I went to put that one on and it broke as well.  I was never able to wear the necklace even once.  I do not recommend this product to anyone!!!!!

Okay, I may be picky, but these earrings are just too thin!  I get the idea of delicate, sparkly things, but these don't look so much delicate as they do insubstantial.  They are pretty and sparkly, but the crystal looks like all I could afford was a thin slice.  The picture also makes the crystals appear blue-ish, but mine are more of a yellow-ish tint.  Not what I expected

Recieved my Orange Monster Last September. I have worn it every day. I like the look and design of this watch but unfortunatly this watch does not keep very accurate time. Often losing about five minutes a week. I have friends who also own the Black Monster and anonther Orange monster and they have the same complaint. 

If I was to buy another watch I would not buy this Seiko again

I share my bad experience with Seiko Monster and some say Im stirring up trouble. Hey, we're in a democracy when I last checked. Duh.  Yeah maybe I am spreading the word about my faulty Seiko Monster but that's the TRUTH and I want others to know that my Seiko Monster was defective. At least Im not a dumb fanatic Seiko Monster cultist who idolizes this watch with a candle-lit shrine, chants, and ritual. For crying out loud, it's just a watch, an inanimate spiritless object, that does not have feelings or civil rights! But it did hurt that I wasted $150 for this bad watch. I dont care about giving the watch a chance, regulating, breaking it in, etc. What happened to my Seiko Monster is that it stopped, which is not good, so I returned for an exchange.

This thing is miniscule. It barely fits on my (petite) seven year old's neck. Although the size is mentioned in the description, the picture is misleading - the pendant itself is *smaller* than the image on the screen - and I consider that borderline false advertising.

I should have been a more aware buyer, so this review isn't to say the product is bad, just be aware of how small it is - my daughter couldn't even find it in the bag when I gave it to her, it was so small she thought I'd bought her an empty bag

 you can't use this watch opener alone. You need a vise to hold the watch. The gromets that go into the opener that are supposed to fit into the watch back grooves do not stay in. As soon as you turn it over they fall out. I've already lost two of them. It's a poorly made item, and if it woldn't cost about as much to return it as keep it I would return it

loved how quiet it runs, have one double the price and twice the noise! only one problem, the bottom turn table stopped within the first week!! yet the top turn table kept working. contacted amazon and they secured a return.  only problem cost $11.00 to return. seems the quality control needs improving

I bought this winder for my husband because of the price. But it is so loud!!!!  We had to put it another room because it was way too noisy for the bedroom. I wouldn't recommend this. I guess sometimes you get what you pay for.

I'm in the military,  It hard for me to purchase items especially stationed overseas.  It's always been easy to order from Amazon as always, I never had any problems.  the earrings were beautiful but the post was very hard to remove from the earrings, when i pulled to remove the post while in my ear, the post broke off from the ball earring.  I only had them for two weeks

I liked the watch. I had to send the first one back because the date would never change. I got the second one a month ago and haven't been able to wear it for the past two weeks because the band gave me a skin rash. Nice looking watch. Too bad I have to carry it around in my pocket now

I am very dissapointed with the band on this watch. The band absorbs and holds moisture. The last thing I want while exercising is a sopping wet watch band around my wrist. This could cause irration and a rash. WHAT WAS THE DESIGNER THINKING? Moreover, even when dry the band is rough to the skin and not comfortable to wear.

I have liked Timex watches and felt the company was innovative and thoughtful in its watch designs. This watch band is neither innovative nor thoughtful in its design. 

I don't even want to wear this watch. I really don't think I should have to buy a new watch band for my brand new watch.

Furthermore, Timex customer service is like dealing with a bunch of idiots. It is as if they read about 2 words of your email and then reply. I guess they think that if they keep feeding you stupid answers long enough, you'll eventually go awa

Big plus was the large digits on display: I'm short-sighted and run without my specs, so I needed that. The feel of the watch is nice. However, one big problem with it was that moving my wrist around kept poking the buttons and changing the display without warning (maybe because I have big wrists). Bigger problem yet: it took all of about 4 months for the plastic strap to break

There aren't any colors in this pendant, just a ugly topaz which ruins the pendant, same happened with heart I ordered from this seller. Normal Swarovski crystals do NOT have a Topaz covering the beauty of the crystals. Sorry I wasted my money, should have bought from Swarovski site

Come on!  I thought they had erroneously mailed out CZs!  These earrings dont have even the faintest tinge of blue in them!  What a RIP!   The sterling silver was nice and well-constructed but i purchased these earrings on the strength of what i thought were the dazzling blue topaz stones.  Quite a disappointment!  I had to buy an emergency back-up Christmas gift for my best friend

Please read Mr. Marcus C. Dunn's review because I agree with all his negative and positive points about these earrings.

In my case, I bought it as one of the many small presents for my fiancee. When I first received it today, I was really liked the "design" of the earring.  But after closer examination, I noticed that the "blue" stone was "very light blue". Good quality earring for a young teenager (9 to 14 years old) but not for the woman I'm going to spend the rest of my life with. Returning the earring and definitely learned my lesson - Jewelry has to been seen and bought with your "own" eyes and not through fancy "photoshop" website with touchup/enhanced photos

Amendment to below review (Mar 07):  My wife really likes them and wears them all the time.  I'd upgrade at least one more star, maybe two if I could.
----------------------------------------------------------

My son wanted to buy mama's present this Christmas so naturally, we turned to Amazon for computer skill training and the ability to view a lot of products easily.  

The earrings arrived today (very quickly) but the stone is not nearly as robust as the picture depicts.  The stone is white, like a fake diamond.  When viewed in other kinds of light, you can see a slight tint of blue but nothing like the picture.  

Another issue - the clasp or ear stud is flimsy.  I may return them (need to ask my son) but I don't think these earrings will last more than a couple of wears.

On the positive side - it really is a nice design

This was a present to myself for my birthday.  I thought I was purchasing a quality product.  Two weeks after receiving the item it stopped working.  I took it to a certified jewler for battery replacement and a few days after that it stopped again.  I sent it back for a refund and not very happy I have to pay a restock fee for a defective item.  I will be rethinking future purchases...

I don't know who's running the show at Amazon, but thier packing is atrocious... they packed this watch with only a single air bubble. of course when I received it it fell out of its tin, and was scratched... be wary of buying anything from amazon in regards to precious jewelry..... watch was fine though, so if you really want this item, purchase it somewhere else

Croton makes very superficial products - they look good on the shelf, but are very poorly constructed.  Once you get them home they start to fall apart.

They have no customer service at all.  Nobody answers the phone or returns email.  Before buying a Croton watch - call their customer service.  You won't get through

I am very disappointed with this ring.  It is very pretty, but once you take the string off it falls apart and there are no instructions to put it back together.  My husband and I have been trying to put it back together based on the picture of the ring on this website and have had NO luck.  Now all I have is a pile of silver rings that I cannot wear.  If anyone knows how to put this back together, please post how!  Thanks

The diamonds sold by this company contain heavy carbon deposits.  As a result, the diamonds are dark in color and don't sparkle like one would expect for the money paid.  I'm still waiting to receive a full refund after returning almost 3 weeks ago.  I do not recommend purchasing from this company if you're looking for a diamond that truly catches the eye

The chain was MUCH thicker than I expected. And it's pretty obvious that it isn't real silver. But, if you want some cheap metal bling, this will do it.

I received the watch and it is definitely a great looking watch.  Unfortunately the crown wouldn't pull out (to set the date/time) so I returned it immediately.  Fortunately, Amazon's return policy is very easy and convenient with no charge for shipping (either way) for broken items.  I'll probably try again with another Invicta from Amazon

I loved these earrings, and at the price, I thought they'd be great. However, when I got them, I quickly discovered that the back for one of the pair was too loose to actually stay on the earring. Within two days, the earring had fallen out and I have yet to find it. There $15 down the drain

The packaging the bracelet came in was quite upscale, nice black leather case, MUCH nicer than the bracelet deserved, however.
The bracelet itself is light weight and the heart attached is ridiculously cheap. It is not rounded as pictured, but flat like a dog tag (only much smaller). I'm using mine as a base for a charm bracelet but I would never wear it by itself. I understand though that it is NOT an expensive bracelet and the weight is probably about right for .925 silver at that price

These watches sounded like a good deal, given the original price.  I ordered two, one for myself and one for my brother.  They arrived today and both could not be set.  That is, the pin on the side of the watch which you pull out to set the date and time would not pull out.  They were both stuck in the case so tight I broke a nail in the attempt.  And I agree with the others that the minor dials are so small they are useless.  They go back tomorrow

I was very disappointed in this purchase, and eventually ended up returning it.  The actual product did not live up to my expectation.  While the cross was of average quality (not great, but OK), the chain was very cheaply made.  It did not even have a clasp on it -- you had to pull it over your head to get it on.  The price of this item did not match the quality of the product, by any means.  Even though I was disappointed with the item, I have to say that the company was extremely easy to work with as far as getting a refund.  Their customer service staff were very friendly and took the item back, no questions asked.

I have purchased eight of these units over the past year. Two of the eight have stopped working altogether, and this morning one of the turntables on a third unit now fails to revolve. The seller replaced the first unit that failed,  and when I requested replacement of the second unit, I was told that it has been replaced by a newer model with vertical stacking and more timing features. They could not offer the new model to me in exchange, but they did offer a $20 discount.  It arrived today and seems to be working well. If you are considering purchasing any  unit made by this manufacturer (Garnin), consider it as suitable for short term use, rather than long term usage

Skagen Watch Problem - Don't Buy Their Watches-Crystals Crack

I would rate this zero stars but the system will not allow me to do this - hence the one star.I bought this watch for my wife as a 2006 Christmas present. The crystal subsequently cracked due to temperature changes. The elegant design of a thin gold rim holding the crystal cannot stand large rapid temperature differences. I went to my local jeweler who was very familiar with the crystal issue with Skagen watches. I called Skagen, seems they are aware of this problem too. However the only option offered was to send the watch back for repair -pay $25.00 for repair of the crystal, pay $8.95 for s&h and then pay insurance and return postage. As I paid $65.00 for the watch I consider this a total ripoff. I would not buy another product from Skagen and recommend that Amazon discontinue selling any Skagen products until they become a responsible corporate partner. It is a pretty watch and seemed like a good deal - but it is not turning out that way. Or you can buy this watch and only wera it in warm climates

the watch is beautiful, graceful, even elegant...BUT the clasp is designed by a designer who likes complexity. this has, as do all of the mesh bands, has the clasp from HELL!!!

out of the box, it needed a manual to figure out...this the first warning sign. setting up to the wrist size was awkward and hard to do. then putting the watch on and hooking one mechanism over some rod is very hard, then there are more steps, each one a real challenge. then when i took my watch off, i must have pulled the wrong lever and zip the watch feel groundward. happy to say it ended up on the bed, for had it gone to the hard floor, i may be looking at a new crystal buying experience.

an older person with hands no longer working well will find this watch impossible to put on and take off.

i could never ever recommend this watch, not for it's looks, but just for the band and clasp...foolish foolish person who designed it

I understood the necklace and bracelet to be a matched set. When the pearls arrived the necklace was a different color and grade than the bracelet. It was really too bad because the bracelet was really rather nice looking. The neklace however was some kind of peach color and so full of flaws, Yeach..

The watch winder is very quiet and inexpensive.  However, the quality is suspect - one side stopped rotating after a week.  You probably get what you pay for. Too much hassle and does not make economic sense to ship back and incur international shipping charges

I've owned a fairly heavy Seiko Kinetic for several years and recently had it repaired when it began having trouble holding a charge. To avoid problems with my reenergized time piece, I decided to invest in a winder.  After comparing online prices and reading dozens of reviews, I thought I had found a reasonably priced solution to keep my Seiko moving.  This winder does everything it's supposed to do (spin, stop, reverse, etc.) but can't provide sufficient motion to activate the charging mechanism inside my heavyweight watch.  Unfortunately, my kinetic may have made it's final sweep around the dial.  On the bright side, I now have a winder that I can only hope does a better job with my NEXT automatic watch

Bought this for our 20 year old son for x-mas.  I was very disappointed with the quality of this $85 pendant and returned it the very next day.  The chain looked and felt like plastic.  My initial reaction when I took it out of the box and felt how light it was in my hand was that it came from a bubble gum machine.

Went to a Christian bookstore the next day and found a beautiful sterling silver cross pendant for $28 that was 1,000 times better than this $85 one

I had this heart rate monitor for 7 days.  The first couple of days it worked fine then it just stopped transmitting.  I tried everything and it just did not work.  The watch itself was fine.  I ended up sending it back and paying the little bit extra for a polar.

My wife received this heart rate monitor from me for Christmas 2005. First my wife, them my father in law and then finally I have been unable to get the chest strap to begin transmitting to the wrist watch. We have read the documentation and looked at the Timex web page without success so far. It is now January 2nd and I still cannot get it working. I may change my review later if I find this is all due to operator error, but at this point three well educated people have been unable to figure it out. At the very least there is a problem with either ease of use or documentation. 

In the Fitness Sensor User Guide there are pieces listed that are not in my box. However, the web page does not mention them. I suspect the guide is an older version. If not, perhaps there has been a shipping error. In any case, I am not happy.

I placed my order with little time to spare before Valentine's Day. Amazon delivered the item is a timely fashion as usual!! However, to my disappointment, when I opened the box the item came in... it looked TERRIBLE. I though the price was a steal, but feel as if I paid way too much for what was received. 

I would not recommend purchasing the item unless you intend to give it to someone who doesn't understand jewelry. Give it to someone for their 10th birthday and you'll find at least 1 smile in the room. 

I have all intentions on returning this item for a refund as I'd feel a little embarrassed giving this as Valentine's Day gift (unless it was for my grandmother).

The picture provided is very disceaving. This product could very well come packaged as a free prize in a box of Lucky Charms. I was planning on giving this to my girlfriend as a gift but was far too ashamed. Stay away, move onto a different product. I will be returning ASAP

The picture and description is not at all what you get. It is tiny, looks cheap and I was ashamed of bieng taken of advantage of. One expects better quality from Amazon. Do not buy ..go to a reputable jewelr. Amazon should stick to selling books

my wife wanted us to get exact watches for valentine's day and she saw this watches that look nice and trendy and had a good price.
So we decided to get 2 MENS LUCIEN PICCARD AUTOMATIC 3 EYE DATE WATCH 26570BU,in a matter of a week we got the watches but one of them came with the days hand off and some screws of the mechaninal part in the back were loose and you could see them thou the clear back the watch came with,lucky for us the other was intact.I understand that although the watch looks nice it's much too fragile even for the price since i owned a lot of cheap watches( casio,swatch,pulsar,etc..)and they are not this fragile.

I bought this for my grandson for Christmas and when his mother was taking it out of the box, the clasp broke and it's not repairable.  Apparently it's attached to the box with staples and unless you have a staple pulled, it's too fragile to just pull from the holder.

I made this purchase in Oct has a X-mas gift.  They arrived and at quick glance appeared to be fine.  I immediately wrapped the earrings and they were hidden away.  X-mas morning after my young daughter open her gift I more closely examined them.  One of the earrings was completely grayish in color; so dark that I would consider it to be defective.  I called the Netaya customer service phone number only to be greeted with "Hello".  After verifying that I had indeed reached Netaya I briefly explained the defect and requested that I be permitted to return the earrings.  I was placed on hold and then told that "the lady" I needed to speak with was busy and I would need to call back or send an e-mail.  I e-mailed the company twice before receiving notice that they would not accept the return because 30 days had passed since purchase.  I would not recommend

This watch is a good size, pretty comfortable, and nice looking for a sport watch. But resetting time or date, or figuring out how to turn off the alarm when you set it by mistake (when you were trying to figure out how to reset the time and date) is super frustrating. The buttons are impossible. I've had it with mine and will buy another product

The watch is quite lightweight and comes with good features.  However, I think it is very hard to use.  You have to hit the buttons just right and for the certain amount of times to change anything.  If you lose the directions, you will never remember how to change it.  It took me over 6 months to change it.  I had many people try to alter it, but it was to no prevail.  Additionally, the watch is not very water resistant.  I went swimming a couple of times and now I hardly see the time due to the water.  

I would recommend paying more for a lot better watch.  For this was a waste of money!

This product is not worth the price by itself.  It's fair at buy-1-get-4-free.  The time function works fine.  The compass, on the other hand, is virtually useless.  Having gotten 5 watches, all 5 compasses were pointing in different directions

i've had three of these watches, but the band loosens up and falls off with no way to put it back on.  its ridiculus b/c seems like the band worsens in water and this is supposed to be fore Triathlons.  however the interval counter is a great feature.  but whats the point of having a watch that the band wont last more than a year or two

This is not a rosary. It is just a necklace with a crucifix and medal attached. A Catholic rosary has 5 decades ( 1 Our Father, 10 Hail Marys) this has no spaces to designate the Our Father from the Hail Marys. It also has 17 extra beads on the rope, and 3 extra beads  on the beginning
just after the crucifix

I've had this watch for about 5 months now and the threaded crown or body stripped, so the crown no longer locks in place. I've tried contacting Citizen for waranty and they say it's not covered. Citizen claims that I over tightened it or cross-threaded it while screwing down, so it will cost $50-100 to repair. 

TOTAL JOKE! I'll never purchase a Citizen watch again. I've always thought they were cheap to begin with. This just confirms my thoughts

I really liked the watch as it looked in the picture. But, when I purchased it, I realized that its way too shiny. If you have a thin wrist, then the watch looks really bulky. Besides, the 12 o'clock mark on the watch is not exactly to the north. So, you have to tilt your head and make sense of the time...

I am going to return this watch..

When I received these earrings, I was delighted.  They were just what I wanted.  However, after wearing them for a few weeks, one of them had a major discoloration on the back portion.  It was not normal tarnish, which one might expect from sterling.  Additionally, I was experiencing extreme irritation, which might suggest that they are not as "sterling" as stated.

With much disappointment, I ended up throwing them away.

This watch is very attractive. However, the clasp is not stable and it has fallen off my arm several times. I rarely wear it as a result and am always surprised it's still there when I do. With a more stable clasp, this would be a 4-Star watch -- but this problem is severe enough that it makes the watch worthless to me (hence, 1 star)

I loved the watch when I first received it.  I wore it two or three times, then a piece of the wire mess that the band is made of broke and was sticking up.  I tried to bend it around but the loose wire continued to snag my clothes so I stopped wearing it.

Ordered this knowing it was inexpensive but what I received was worse than expected in part because Amazon sent the wrong item. Spoke with Customer Service who sent a replacement which they promised would be inspected first; however, the same WRONG item was again sent. The problem is the item has been switched with another silver heart locket, one even cheesier than the product listed. I contacted Customer Service regarding the replacement; they recognize now the real problem and are working to correct ... eventually. Both lockets have been returned; there didn't seem to be any way of getting the proper locket. I wound-up ordering a completely different design from another vendor

I agree that this is a beautiful product; however, I returned these earrings not long ago. The reason is that there is a half arrow at the end of the hook which is used to lock the earring. I tried to wear them, but the half arrow was too big, and I couldn't get them through my earlopes.

The instructions that you do get are wrong.  The items I get and the ones listed are totally different.  It doesn't tell you how to use each of the tools.  Some of the tools I'm still puzzled in what to do with it.  The soft head hammer that is used to knock the pin back into bracelet doesn't look too soft too me!

The kit is a batch of tools that are mostly not defined, with little to no instruction.  Most pieces are of junk quality and break after one or two uses if they last that long.  

Clearly not worth the price.

I've bought a LOT from Amazon over the years. This was the first watch though. I've bought and owned several SEIKO watches. This is probably the WORST experience that I've ever had with Amazon and Seiko too!

The watch came with a box that looked water damaged. The watch itself has a broken clasp. It looks beautiful,but I bought it as a gift. 

When she opened it, the clasp refused to lock. Its never gone far enough to have the time set or even being tried on. Amazon actually tried to sleeze out of it by telling me to follow the waranty pocedures. How long does she have to wait for her Birthday gift? The warranty process could take weeks

I bought this watch because of the stylish looks, the reported reliability, and the fact that it was a watch that would never need batteries.  There were also other functions advertised that appealed to me.  I have owned Casios before and they took extreme wear while still maitaining their function.  This watch I have now will not allow me to go more than five days without the solar battery running out - usually at inopportune times where I really need a watch!  It has become very unpredictable.  Please do not get me wrong, it is a nice watch, I have gotten many favorable comments.  But I want a watch I trust to work day-in, day-out and not one I am constantly worried about.  I guess for someone who has the time to set the thing out in the sun on a regular basis, it would be a good purchase

I order from Amazon frequently, and am consistently happy with the products and service.  However, I was very disappointed in this item--perhaps my own fault for failing to notice that no dimensions were given in the item description.  I wrongly assumed that the charm would be approximately the size of my thumbnail, and was surprised when it arrived and I could barely find it in the tiny blue velvet bag that contained it.  It is miniscule--1 cm long x 1/2 cm wide!  The enamel is applied unevenly, and though the charm is tiny, it is evident that the enamel is thicker in some places, and contains air bubbles in others.  It might be cute on a charm bracelet with a purse or shopping theme, but would not work as a pendant, as I had intended.  I'm sending it back for a refund

I am rather picky, but liked not only the look of these earrings on the webpage, but also the name.  They were not what I was expecting when they arrived.  They are okay, but not nearly what I thought they would be.  They are not very sea opal-ish -- they look too glassy and transparent.  The silver is also okay, but could be better.  I would not recommend.

This set of earrings was only $10 and the delivery from Silver Insanity was fast, but false advertising really pisses me off.  They do not look nearly as nice as the picture, and in fact the "glass" part of the earring is plastic...and it even has bubbles in it. It's ugly. The other earrings that I bought from them also do not look much like their photos

Not as they appear!, March 8, 2007
Reviewer: Rappster (Denver, CO) - See all my reviews 
I ordered these earrings on a 'Gold Box' special and waited eagerly for them to arrive. They were SUCH a disappointment, I returned them the next day. I did not expect the diamonds to be huge, based on their cttw, but the earrings themselves are miniscule! They look like they were made for children. I tried on one earring and couldn't even SEE the earring in my ear, much less tell there were any diamonds--it looked like I didn't even have an earring on!

I paid over $150 for this watch a couple of years ago, and I loved it when I first bought it (as do many of the other reviewers on this page). However, it took about 18 months for the band to break, and then less than 2 years for the watch to completely die. The solar charger slowly quit working - at first I just couldn't set the hands on the watch because it was stuck in "recover" mode, but the digital display was still correct so it was still somewhat usable. Then after a few months of this, everything went blank. I sent it off to Casio expecting a quick, inexpensive repair (or even a free repair, as I expected them to stand behind their product). Shortly thereafter, I received a repair estimate for $94.11 - more than the watch currently sells for brand new! So...in my opinion, the watch is probably worth the $69.00 that it currently sells for, but don't expect it to last more than a year or two. I won't be buying another Casio

I just received this locket, which was intended to be a gift for my niece for x-mas, and had to decline on giving it to her.  when i received it, i actually thought Amazon forgot to put it in the bag it came in.  I shook the bag, felt for the necklace, and finally out popped this itty bitty tiny heart pendant. it's so small, i thought it was more suitable for her doll then for herself. i was very disappointed. other then the size and over priced tag, i thought it was cute - but i will be returning it.
sorry

I had a very similar watch from pulsar that I bought in 1991 - that watch lasted over 15 years with no problems. the LCD stopped working so I finally broke down and bought a new watch. I was shocked and disappointed with amazon sending me 3 dead watches - esp after talking to them asbout making sure it just works before sending it. the final watch was the exact same watch I returned for NOT working.

This watch died (battery?) one year after I bought it.  I like the watch, it  fits well and I'm able to swim in the pool and ocean with it.  But I can't find a place to repair it here on Maui.  It has a 3 year warranty but I'd have to mail it in.  After the battery is changed it needs to be pressure tested.  What a hassle..

I had a watch like this from Pulsar years ago and it worked well. This one I am returning to Amazon because it can't keep time and the calender keeps resetting to Jan 1. It was made in China so what can I expect. I am deeply disappointed in this product. No more Pulsars for m

I bought a Nike Triax C5 heart rate monitor watch a year ago. The strap is already falling apart near the bezel. The watch has a 2 yr warranty but do not cover the strap or the crystal, even if the problem is poor workmanship.

I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 because their customer service (communication and such) have been very good.

I purchased this bracelet a few months ago and (a few days ago) had the unfortunate experience as the previous reviewer. I was taking it off and it snapped in the middle.   Once you could see the insides, it was obviously not pure Sterling Silver as the "materials" portion indicates.  I will be returning this item for a new one (already gave my girl a matching one) and may not even wear it at all...

*very disappointing

Although this product is pretty to look at, one must remember not to bend it to fit as it will crack the silver plating and the bracelet will fall apart in your hands. I do not suggest buying this item as it is not solid sterling silver as you are lead to believe

The good news is the watch's case is quite nice. Now the could-be-improved points. It's sized weird. It's a lot larger than you think. Add to that it's bracelet is rather small so now that I removed a single link I can barely get it over my average sized wrist, and once it's on it's still too loose. Weird , but true. Frankly it's good looking, but I don't think I'll get another one.

I ordered a Swarovsky crystal pendant which I thought was clear like one I had purchased once on a visit to a Swarovsky factory.  The one I received is clear but not like the first one.  It is transparent but has a gold tint which keeps it from being as transparent as the first one. I was disappointed.

Heart pendant does not look as pretty as in the picture, there's this gold topaz covering on both sides that totally ruins the look of the normal Swarovski crystal, in other words, no colors shine at all. Same thing in on other sites for like $1.  Speedy delivery was the only positive

The pendant is nice however the pewter wrap around kind of ruins the entire design.  It does not go with the center design.  I think it would look better with a slightly tarnished silver look.  Pewter is just too dull for this design and the necklace does not work well with the pendant either.

I have had an early version of this watch for 17 years, and when it malfunctioned, I decided it was time to get a new one.  The previous watch had been repaired 2 times earlier, and unfortunately every time I got it back from COSERV, it would be less and less accurate, thus I decide to get a new one.  The new one was made in Maylasia vs Japan (I have read on this site that one needs to be concerned about that), and was lighter in weight, but kept time well for about one week.  I bumped the watch on a table (nothing severe, the previous watch endured much more) and it immediately started gaining more than 10 minutes per hour.  I had high hopes that this watch would at least meet, and hopely exceed the durability of the previous watch, but it did not make it passed one week of casual wear.  I returned it in disappointment

I bought these earrings as a gift for my sister and the first time she wore them the post fell off. I felt like the biggest loser. When I contacted Amazon, they said that because it was over 2 months that I had bought the earrings I couldn't return them. What a rip off. These earrings don't even deserve 1 star

I chose these earrings because of the yellow and white gold combo.  They felt quite flimsy when I got them.  I do like a lightweight earring, but not a flimsy one.  The studs on these are not attached as firmly as I would like.  One has already come off.  They are however very pretty.  The quality was just not what I expected

Actual picture of band shows how replacemnt band fails to follow curve of watch body. Real Dud.
Monthly cost of ownership makes it as costly as a Role

I recived the watch and it is fine, however I want to complain above Amazon's way to pack purchases, Amazon pack a tiny watch box in a huge box, then I have to pay lots of money paying a mail forwarder because to  this policy.

I use a Mail forwarder from Miami to Caracas (Venezuela) and I Spread 19$ instead 5$ because box size and I recived a huge box full of air bags.

This situation is not the first time to happend and I hope Amazon compense me in any way

The watch obviously looks nice and the links have a nice, unique design. Unfortunately I have had terrible issues with the pins between the links. There are multiple links that wiggle out throughout the day and I have to shimmy them back in all day long. I tried having this issue addressed with a jeweler but it didn't last. This is the kind of issue I would expect from an inferior watch, perhaps one well under 100 bucks.

To be honest... when i saw the picture in the description area, it looks like an awesome watch!, but when i opened the package I wanted to return it.

If you see the picture you can appreciate the digital information, like thermometer, digital hour, day, month, etc... but in the real life, you must incline it until you are able to see it..

The other thing, is the thermometer, is not so accurate because your body heat affects it. When my digital home thermometer marks 72 F, the watch marks 92 F so if you want an accurate measure you need to take it off, and wait between 20min and 30min to reach an accurate measure (This information was extracted from the Manual). 

So in conclusion, if you want a watch with a thermometer built-in... just keep looking for other models.

This is a beautiful watch, but just a word of warning - it is BIG!  I actually returned it for a smaller one.  The watch face is 30mm, which is quite a bit larger than most women's watches.  The face was almost the size of my husband's watch.  If you like big watches, then you will love this one, it is beautiful, but if you want a normal size watch, I would reccommend that you keep on shopping

Though the design is cool, the quality of this earrings set is poor.  They are so light and the color is strikingly white, which makes them appear cheaper.  I also bought the pendant with the same design and I'm so disappointed with both.  :-(

I suggest that amazon collection makes white gold of a good quality with the similar design.

I received my new Fossil watch just a few weeks ago.  At first, I was pleased with the watch.  The overall appearance is nice, its very dainty with a thin band.  The green dial is a pale lime green, not too bright.  Everything was going good until yesterday when I noticed the watch seemed to have stopped working (and this is only after 2 weeks of having it!!).  I reset the time and it started ticking again, so I thought it was just a fluke.  Now it is working sometimes but is generally running slow (the time keeps falling farther behind).  If this is a battery problem already I am very disappointed that amazon would send out a new watch with an old battery.  I expect to take this up with them, as obtaining a new battery isn't very easy because there isn't a fossil store nearby.  In the manual it says to mail in the watch for a new battery, which costs $15!!  How inconvenient.  I am not impressed

I bought this thinking it would be a kind of sports watch - for swimming and running.  Unfortunately it is not waterproof for swimming, is unbelievably bulky, and has this strange time setting system which only works in the USA and Europe (I live in Australia). In the end I gave it to a relative in the USA

I think the picture is better than the real thing.   The gems are actually pretty decent.   They are a good size and have a hint of color.   However, the setting is so deep and so bulky that when the earrings are on, you can't see the sparkle of the stones.   If the setting was daintier and the stones had more color, these would look great.   But as they are, the earrings look like blobs, not tanzanite.

I have had this watch for about 4 months. If you don't have a job operating a jack hammer it will probably run itself down. I am very disappointed in the watch. It was not cheap. I paid about $200. for it and I expected better. I am one of those people that never take my watch off and it still winds down and stops. I made a big deal about this watch with my wife, and now I get a lot of grief when I complain about it. It is sturdy, having hit the wall several times

The description states that it holds large watches. But they hit the glass when the top is closed, especially Casio's larger G-Shocks. The lock did not work, but I don't care about that. The beige material on the inside and pillows peels off! I will not purchase another case of this brand.

This watch was of such poor quality that the second hand fell off by the third day of use. The cost of shipping to claim a defect under warranty was more than the initial cost of the watch. A total disappointment and waste of time and money, don't buy this watch.

I wear this watch every day and I usually work outside. I am very pleased with the features and the durability. It seemed daunting to work the features at forst, but a short time with the instruction book made them accessable and easy.

I have only two complaints: One is that the metal band has developed a slight "squeak" when I move my wrist sometimes. The tin man needs oil. The second is that despite being placed by a huge window every night, the watch does not always get the time signal from Ft. Collins. I have gone as long as several days without getting it - but when you consider that most watches do not get it at all, I am OK with the spotty reception

The watch is solar powered and time is synchronized with an Atomic clock.  I'm not sure how that works (radio waves?) but the watch is extremely accurate.  The watch charges easily - put it under a light when you take it off- and it has a powersaving feature that kicks in when there is no light source (i.e. it's dark).  The buttons/settings work similarly to a battery powered G-shock but there is a little more complexity because you have to set your home city for the atomic clock sync to work right.  It's the first Casio I've owned with a metal band.  Unless you're a gorilla, You'll need to remove some links from the watch band.  I did this myself but you may want to take it to a jewelry store cause they have the right tools.  I love the watch.  It is everything you would expect from a G-Shock

You'll most likely have to get the links adjusted
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
The strap/links on these G-Shocks are quite oversized: when I first got it, I could fit the watch around my legs! (You'll most likely have to get the links adjusted). Ironically, the four side buttons on the watch is small. So even if you have a huge wrist, you'll probably have trouble pressing the buttons! (Not for huge fingers) 

***BEWARE*** the picture shows the four side buttons on the watch in silver, but the left and right side buttons on this model is actually plain black! It is quite misleading! The silver side button is actually the MTG920DJ model (which is the 2005 version). According to Casio, the MTG920DA was actually released in 2004 with black side buttons. If you search the Casio website, it will only display the MTG920DJ (their most recent version); most websites that still sell the MTG920DA are just taking the latest MTG920DJ version picture from Casio's website. The MTG920DJ seems to have the same features as this one (MTG920DA), except the four side (left and right) buttons are in silver. 

For those of you wondering about the three circles on the watch: 
the first one on the very left is basically a wannabe-analog display - basically, every five minutes, a bar increases (or decreases when it gets full); it's just mostly there for cosmetic reasons. 

The second one in the middle is the battery status; it has an L (Low), M (Medium), and H (High) and the bar would display in one of those areas. If you get out in the sun a lot or know an area in your home where the sun shines a lot, then you won't have a problem with the battery ever going below High. Moreover, it has a power saving feature; the watch will go into sleep mode (display off) when it is in a completely dark area for a long time. 

Finally, the third circle on the very right is where it tells you what options are enabled/disabled. It shows SPL (split time for stopwatch), DST (Daylight Saving Time), SIG (Hourly Signal), ALM (Alarm), SNZ (Snooze), and Auto EL (Automatic Electro-Luminescent backlight - the backlight turns on by tilting it a certain degree towards your face without having to manually press the backlight button.) 

Keep in mind, synchronizing with the atomic signal is not instant: it usually takes around 3 minutes (at least for me, I live in California.) And if you're in a busy area or near an electronic, it might be difficult; try again or move to a different area. Moreover, it should show you the strength/level (4 levels) of the signal (while you're synchronizing) with a satellite icon on the watch. There is also a feature that automatically synchornizes for you while you're sleeping at 2:00AM, 3:00AM, 4:00AM, and 5:00AM. Therefore, it's not always necessary to syncronize it yourself because by the time you wake up, it should be ready to go. 

Overall, this watch is attractive and fun to wear. The atomic radio signal feature is very cool; having the official time is great - right to the precise second! I've had this watch for months now, and I enjoy wearing it daily. 

This watch does have a lot of feature - except, it's a pity it does ***NOT*** have a countdown timer! 

Pros: 
- Cool design 
- Water/scratch resistant; G-Shock are known for their toughest watches. (Update: I've worn this watch daily for almost a year and a half now and not a single scratch - still looks brand new!)
- Solar Power; battery life is excellent; never had the power ever go below High. Power Saving Feature. 
- Position of the time and date is easy to read at one glance. 
- Metal strap 
- Can display World Time with Local Time 

Cons: 
- The side buttons are small and tight to press (must use like the very tip of the fingers) 
- Atomic signal takes too long manually, and it usually is not possible to synchronize while wearing the watch; if you're inside the home, it is usually best to take off the watch and leave it near a window. 
- Alarm beep can be a little longer perhaps (even my inexpensive Timex Watch would beep and it would gradually beep faster, which I actually like a bit better.) 
- No countdown timer. (How could they forget this?!) 

Also, try to research other models instead of finding out the hard way (like I did about the side buttons) before purchasing.

I love knowing the exact time (even if my mom thinks I am crazy), and it works like a... clock! I never have issues with the updates (in Illinois), but I do have a few minor issues: the watch is too thick (5/8 inch), the band is made for a gorilla and is very difficult to adjust for a human, the buttons are hard to press, and the manual is too small and hard to read. Still, if I had a choice between this watch or my borhter's Rolex, I will take his Rolex and exchange it for 40 Casios. Thank you, Casio

I've owned several watches, including the older G-Shock and the Casio Men's G-Shock Atomic Solar Watch # GW1400DA-9AV (among others).

First, there are so many G-shock models to choose from. You could have bought the # GW1400DA-9AV (the stainless steel model) for the same price ($75) during the week of July 24, 2006.

This watch simply has everything one ever needs for time functionality: solar power (no need for daily rewinding, kinetic body movement, or batteries), synch with the atomic clock in Colorado (ultimate accuracy), time zone adjustment (ease for jet setters), light button (which also goes off when you tilt your wrist), stop watch functionalities, day/date functionalities, and countless other time-related functions. In this respect, it's much more functional than a Patek (even the complicated wrist watch models, or the more mundane Rolex, etc.). Of course, it's a lowly Casio, costing a mere $75 (vs. $75,000 for a low end complicated Patek)

Buyers should be aware that the watch is purtty bulky, probably 5/8 to 3/4 in. thick. One needs a sporty forearm/wrist to go with this watch.

For the fun of wearing it couple times a year, the price, and just to look at it as part of a collection of watches, I'd highly recommend it.

I live in eastern Pennsylvania, about 1600 - 1700 miles away from the atomic time signal station and this watch syncs fine right on my bureau, 4 feet from a window, and in a watch case.
When I received the watch, the battery indicator was on Medium, after about 30 minutes or less on a sunny windowsill, it achieved Full charge.
I'm quite pleased with it

I bought two of these for my twin two year old nephews who liked my watch.  They're too young to tell time but love the watches and asked to put them on in the mornings while I was visiting.  It has great features to help kids learn how to tell time and the watch is small enough for tiny wrists but with a face big enough for learning

I returned these, because they were too large for me. To be fair to Zina, they were as described, and I wasn't sure they would work. The only reason I'm not rating them a 5 is that, having returned them, I don't know how long the clasp would work.

I kept gold small hoops I bought at same time--very happy with them. Zina's  product descriptions are exceptionally good

I love the look and function of this watch BUT.....Guys if you have any hair on your wrists, be prepared to have it forcibly removed by the metal band.  I've had 3 other Fossil watches and never had this problem. I think Fossil needs to address the clearance between the links on this one. OUCH!

I got this watch one week ago. Its very good looking watch. Its $85 but looks like $150+ watch.
All of my friends are asking about this watch as it catches others eye very easily.
It upper dial (having number 05-15-25 etc.) rotates clock wise; this is a functionality to keep the time accurate while fast driving.
Its bit heavy, but now i am used to it.
I would recomend this watch to everyone who like heavy looking watches on their wrist

The earrings were very cute and the screw backs were definitely a good find. My daughter loved them so much she actually had them almost a whole month before she lost one.  But that is no bash on the earrings, the fact that she did not lose them the first week is a major accomplishment.

I would definitely buy them again.

I got these today and was so shocked when they arrived, wow, these are amazing hoops for 25 dollars. I am more than pleased, don't have an idea what some of the other reviewers were complaining about, I am floored at the price and the quality at the same time. With free shipping these are a must, great gift idea and everyday earrings. Amazon got them to me in a matter of 4 days and I'm in Hawaii, they also came beautifully packaged, I'm in love with them, don't let these sell out

I sent these for my cousin (who has everything!)on her 16th Birthday.  When i saw them later they were smaller than I expected----but she wears them everyday and they look very cute and understated.  They are a nice color and look better than cheap silver ones.  Plus if you are like my cousin and your ears get irritated with anything but gold--I would recommend these

This Invicta 2699 watch, it's a nice watch, the case of stainless steel, polished, looks very well, solid. with transparent case back, although there is nothing exceptional to look at.
Dial of mother of pearl, clear and clean, with not too many words or other dials on it, looks elegant, the Roman numbers are very good for that dial; the hands are big enough to be seen even in poor light conditions.
The movement is a Miyota automatic with 21 jewels, works fine, for the price.
It has poor power reserve, so if you do not use it for 24 hours, it will stop, nothing to worry about

These have quickly become my favorite pair of earrings.  They look substantial when worn, but they are lightweight and comfortable.  They go well with either silver or white gold necklaces.  They are shiny and have a classic appearance.  Plus the snap bar locks them securely in place.  Buy them and you won't be sorry!  They also make a great gift item

I was getting worried if it would arrive before my girlfriend went home for the holidays.  Then as promised it arrived today, last day in the estimated delivery window.  Hey its christmas I understand shipping sucks this time of year but I still would have been angry if it was late.
  Ok item itself looks great, I love the chain that came with it.  The box looks a little to cheesy on the outside to be romantic, but the wrapping was high class enough to make up for the box.  
  Im sure my girlfriend will love this, it will go great with her tattoo

This is a great watch for a woman!  I can't see it fitting a man and the watch face is too small for a man.  I ordered it for my sister who has a large wrist and it is perfect for her

My watch band was wider than the tool allowed, so I used a milling machine to  let it accept 1/8 " more. Ad should have stated how wide a band would work in this device. Otherwise worked well

This quote became my all-time favorite the first time I read it.  I was so delighted to find it on a piece of jewelry!  I had it on my &quot;wish-list&quot; for over a year -- this year my husband finally took the hint and bought it for me!  It's a beautiful piece, is very comfortable and is made of quality silver.  I highly recommend it for anyone who finds herself needing a boost of self-reliance throughout the day

I have been suffering from depression since I was 15 years old. My mother bought this bracelet for me at the age of 21 as a surprise (after some hinting; I was patiently waiting to buy it on my own!) I must say it is one of the most beautiful and meaningful gifts anyone has ever given to me. I don't believe I have taken it off for a single day in the several months I've owned it; it fits perfectly, matches everything and its beautiful message keeps me more centered and hopeful. It also keeps me feeling close to my mother while I'm away at college. She doesn't know it yet, but I hope to buy her the same bracelet for Christmas. It's a simply amazing gift for yourself or someone else

I purchased these at $16 in December 2006; they are currently running for $15, which is so worth it for 14K white gold earrings.  At this price you should be thinking about next year's Christmas presents.  Otherwise, if you are looking for a treat for yourself, you will not be disappointed.  The reason they lose a star with me is that for the 7mm size, the earring backs should be larger; they are on the small side

This is a great looking watch, and I like that it is lightweight.
I took it to the jeweler to have a few links removed. It's just techie enough for a geek like me (updates via satellite, days of the week in several languages, etc). Enjoy.

I was a little apprehensive about these Waveceptor watches after reading reviews for them.  Common complaints included scratches on the face, atomic synching problems, and difficulty setting up the watch for the first time.

I received my watch and it was in perfect condition, no scratches, light or otherwise.  It is light but the construction feels solid.  I was wondering what the initial setup was going to be like, since others had claimed it had taken hours(!!!).  It literally took me 15 seconds.  It involves holding a button down for 5 seconds, and pressing the other button a few times.  Once it was set up, the watch immediately synched itself to my local time with no problems at all  (I live in central Florida.)  I've only owned the watch for a day now and I must say I'm impressed with it so far.  I haven't experienced any troubles mentioned in the other reviews, and I'm very satisfied with my purchase.  Also, I chose the Super Saver shipping, Amazon told me it'd take 3 weeks to get it to me.  I received it in 4 days

  This watch is a high quality item for low money. You might think at first the color of the face is a little loud but you grow to like it, and as most of you know, if you have to grow to like something, you like it for a longer time than something that just "grabs you" quickly.
  It keeps perfect time at all times as it is updated with a signal from Fort Collins, Colorado every night. I would definately reccommend this item/brand for anyone looking for a watch

This is a great watch for my husband, Mike.  He has wanted a watch that he didn't have to worry about changing the time on all the time.  He travels often in his work.  I also has a nice lighted face which is easy for him to read.  Getting older posses some vision problems, so being able to read the time on your watch is a wonderful advantage.  He also likes that it is on atomic time and energy

In locker rooms and office corridors across this nations, a battle rages for the souls of men. Perhaps only the fratricidal dispute between boxers and briefs has more violently bloodied the masculine nose of our generation than this battle. Yet the jury remains out: wallet or money clip, what'll it be?

Lives and careers are savaged by a choice of one over the other, yet the passion that drives guys in the direction of the traditonal leather wallet or - alternatively - to the minimalist money clip continues unabated.

The Titanium Money Clip scores a victory for the latter. Small, lightweight, attractive, it cleans a hip pocket out, straightens the hang of the trouser, and facilitates the quick snatch of a bill when the wallet guys are still sorting through receipt they carelessly shoved in with their banknotes.

The only complaint regarding this product is that it requires five or six bills, minimum, before it has a sufficient wad to clasp firmly.

Other than that ... well ... I can't even remember where I tossed my wallet

Product matches expectations; no problems. Some other customers complained about how lightweight it is. To me it seems like what you should expect from titanium (after all, that's why they use it to make aircraft). The predictions of it getting sprung (losing its spring tension) were more of a legitimate concern to me, but I've had it for a month or two and it seems fine. It seems no more likely to do that than any other money clip, which is to say, maybe it eventually will, or maybe it won't, them's the risks of life. Go for it

I purchased these earrings for my infant daughter. Since most earrings are too large in my opinion for a 3 month old's ears, this was the perfect solution. As my daughter likes to lie on me when taking a short nap, the first earrings she had poked into me and it was uncomfortable for me. These are small enough not to bother me.
The prongs do cover a bit more of the diamond than is shown in the pictures, but they are still very cute. I also like the backs, as they screw on to the posts, and are nice and safe for baby's head

I needed something to express how I felt in a way that few words would say exactly that and the yin yang necklace did it for me.

I purchased this item as a present for my friend and I. The piece is beautiful and is a great gift for anyone. I myself have the Yin half of the duo. The only problem is that the black paint in the Yin half is easily washed away. Now I don't mean that it all washes away but it does erode. The Yin looks a lot better with a little silver shining through the paint, however, but I do worry about all of the paint eventually going away. Other than that minor defect the necklaces are wonderfull. I'll definately be buying from this seller again

I didn't realize how picky my taste is with rings until I scoured Amazon for hours looking for something that would interest me.  This ring is one of the few I found, and I am far from a fan of having stones in my rings.  It has a nice low profile.  I've yet to have it catch on anything.  I'm also not a fan of open knot work on rings, but this again managed to sidestep that distaste.  The stone has no backing, so it gets an interesting red tinge in the middle, tinted by my finger

I read the reviews of the other buyers while I was purchasing ing this ring. The first review makes it sound mediocre while the other made it sound perfect. I promised myself I'd write a TRUE review of the ring once I recieved my own. The stone is neither large nor gawdy. The silver pattern is slighty thick for my tastes however not noticably thick. The stone is not high nor fake looking. The picture gives an acurate display of the product. All in all, it's a beautiful ring and a lovely buy for the price asked.

I'm quite happy with these and writing to say so, because other users' comments were very helpful to me--especially the person who said that the earrings were substantial: i.e., though diminutive, they have bulk so are visible, with nice warm glow

I bought these earrings for my 10-year old grandaughter for Christmas.  I think she has worn them everyday since - she loves them.  They are not large hoops; if fact, they are a bit small -- but perfect for her. For an adult, I think a little bit larger size would be better. All in all, I was very pleased with the earrings; the quality is very good.

When I first ordered these, I wasnt expecting anything of high quality since their price was so low. It was more of a side gift for my girlfriend. But upon recieving, I was taken back at how nice they really look. You cant pass these up for the price. Shipping was very fast too.

This is so cute and if you are a pig collector you need to add him to your collection.  The blue eyes and rhinestone ears are what make it. Nice pink color, not too bright or too dull and so small, it's cute. The little compartment can fit a few rings or earrings in it. Very, very nice

I was impressed with the quality and detail of the ring. The person I bought it for loves it, and as a jeweler herself, that says alot. I was afraid of the metals when I bought it, but she has had no problems. Overall the ring is a gorgeous imitation of history and I would highly recommend it and the company I bought it from

This is a very grown up looking watch and my son who is seven, loved it, but it bothered him that it didn't fit very well. The velcro part didn't go very far so it was too big and we ended up putting this one away for maybe next year and buying another timex that was easier to adjust, which worked pretty well by the way.

We bought this watch for my 8-year old-- who loves it.  We deliberately wanted him to develop his time-telling skills (i.e., no digital watches please!), and have a "cool" watch, too.  The velcro strap, the second hand, water-resistant qualities ("I can wear it in the shower, Mom!"), and the indiglo face (very cool in movie theaters) made this a great buy.

The watch is very colorful. It is even safe to wear in the shower. However the watch cannot be read in the dark and the hands are even hard to see in daylight. It takes an extra few seconds to figure out wear the hands are. But adults who can't get enough of Harry should consider this watch

My husband likes watches and is a bit of a geek, so this was the perfect Christmas gift for him.  I was a little bit apprehensive when I recieved it but it works just like it should.  It is not apparent from the discription, but this watch does have the date feature.  I couldn't have gotten him a better gift for the price, he wears it every day

I bought this watch two months back and am using it as a casual watch. But it would go with a formal dress even. Works as promised; I have tried synching this watch in two countries, three signalling stations and several time zones, and it works perfectly well. To quote the cons, it IS a bit chunky, but that's ok since I'm using it as a casual watch. The back of the watch is plastic, which makes it look cheap but don't know if there is any specific reason for that. Also it would've gratified my every needs, had there been an 'Indiglo' or 'Nightglo' feature. In complete darkness, the irradiating hands look fine, but if it is half light, then I have to spend a second or two searching for the hands. These are minor things and I am a perfectionist, so here I stamp 4 stars on it.

I bought this as a gift for my husband. He loves it, it works great, looks great, and the price was awesome!

The bragging points of this watch are that the face is large, the numbers are easily readable, it keeps great time because it is atomic,  and the hands and numbers glow in the dark for nighttime viewing. 

The model we bought had a metal-link silver band, and I wish I could have bought the plastic/leather band, but it was not available at the time.  The silver band looks great and my husband liked it, but for work he has to have a non-metal band. We replaced the band with a plastic/rubber one, and the watch is still looking great, and my husband can use it for work or dressy situations!  

I can't believe the great price we got this watch for. It is really a perfect watch for men.

The watch has a nice weight, beautiful face and is generously sized.  I need to have several links removed before I can wear it.  It comes nicely packaged, although at first, I didn't think that instructions and warranty paperwork were included.  They were hidden inside the top of the watch box.  It was difficult at first to pull out the pin in order to set the time, but once I got the pin out, it was a snap to adjust the date and time.  

All in all, an excellent watch for a great price!

I've only had this watch for about a week, so can't really comment about the long term durability.  However, it is ultra cool watch.

Although I've not got a scale handy at the moment, but it seems to be lighter than my iPod Nano.  Really a featherweight watch, and therefore very comfortable to wear.  

The dial color really can't be adaquately captured in a picture.  It is VERY attractive, much more striking than the image indicates.  Several people have asked where I purchased it.

I'm very happy with this choice

This Skagen watch is full of class, yet it's perfect for casual wear too. Very thin, so it's not clunky like a lot of other watches. Titanium black... and the band is black metal as well. Had to bend the clasp a bit to get it to hold, but now it's perfect. And because it's not an expansion braclet, it's very easy to adjust the band to fit your wrist. I hope to have this for years to come, because I've not seen anything like it. And the price is right too

This watch is so light and thin but so good-looking that even my husband, who doesn't like watches weighing him down, wears it every day.  After three months I don't see any wearing away of the band and the face seems to really resist scratching, because it still looks perfect

the watch is everything I hoped for except I wish the blue dial was a little brighter blue. Handsome as is, just not impressive or eye catching. Other than that minor complaint, it is very slim and very comfortable to wear. You don't even feel it on your arm

Don't buy this watch, unless you want it (and your good taste) to be admired.  It's just beautiful, sort of like man-jewelry for guys that don't wear jewelry.

But I plan to wear it only when I wear certain clothing, to certain events.    I have other watches for other situations

I loved this watch the moment I put it on at Macy's.  I get home to see if I could maybe get a better deal than $135.  As always Amazon comes through yet again with a price of $69 plus I don't pay sales tax on it.  SOLD!  If you've not seen this watch in person the pictures definitely do not do it justice

This watch is for occasions only. you wear this one to weddings dance parties and or formal occassions. 1 you don't bring this to a fishing camp or use it climbing a rock face. 2 it's not a chonographic face so not for military so its not roughed enough to take out into the wilderness to go romping through with your M2A1 rifles. its sole perpuse is to get stares and look pretty on occasions like Birthday events. let your girlfriends buy it for you guys. I bought it because it was titanium mesh, not because of it's latching method. Again its almost 18th century... it's 21 century material used in place of a 18th Century design

I had been looking at the Skagen watches for six months and could not find any sales.  They are priced around $110.  When I saw this particular model for $69, I was excited.  I read some other reviews on other watches and was cautious when some said that they purchased watches that were not in boxes and had no instructions.  This watch arrived three days after I ordered it and was in a beautiful box just like I had bought at the store. It was brand new and I love it.  I especially love it when I get something new on sale and a great deal.  Amazon is a great place to order.  I get merchandise very quickly and at a great price

This is a perfect anytime gift. I bought this for my gf for xmas and she loved it. We have only been dating for 6 months i did not want to get anything that was over the top.  Perfect for any occasion. She'll love it. 

This will wow her but not worry her to think you are rushing anything 


Plus it's under 100. Can't beat the price. Thanks amazon

These earrings are perfect! Perfect in size, color and weight. They're not much bigger then a quater and very light, in a beautiful white gold shine. Yes the post are thicker then most, but after a few days you get use to them. I had a pair like these that were given to me as a gift and I lost one. When I found these on Amazon I wasn't sure how much they would be like my other. They are a perfect match and my old pair was at least 7-8 years old. If you want a perfect hoop that is good for day or night these are the ones

I was hoping that they were a little larger in size and not as thick. However, I think it's a decent buy for only $30.00 I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my girlfriend. It comes packaged in a beautiful velvet blue box thats almost big enough to fit a watch. Very clean presentation when you open it up. The white gold really shines. The free shipping was FAST...and I do mean quick. I ordered this late at night and it arived the very next day. I've never had a quicker shipment for free before. If your looking for a great deal on white gold earings, I think you've found it

The picture for this pendant is deceiving; it is a lot smaller than it appears.  I know the dimensions were given but the picture gives one the impression that it is bigger than it really is.  Nevertheless, my wife likes it very much and that's good enough for me.  The price was right at $18.00 so overall I think it was a good buy.

Being part Irish and born 3 days after St Patricks day, hence my name I was lucky enough to find this item at Amazon.com and it is a top class item with a good finish. The ring seems to keep it's shine with no maintanence required. As usual the service and delivery at Amazon.com is second to none. As an American living in Australia there are so many things I can't get in this country which is why I get things like jewelry from them. Couldn't be happier with this ring

Loving the look of the Rolex Daytona, I spotted this watch on Amazon and just had to have one (at the price).
Arrived in a well padded display box, with all parts of the watch and strap covered in a protective plastic - so no scratches.
Taking out a few links for that custom fit just took a couple of minutes.
The watch looks great - better than the images on the Web - and it works as described.
Other posters that have had issues should read the manual! It does all of the chrono functions, and has full adjustments for hand alignment etc. - Fantastic

I would recommend this watch to anyone who is in the market for a very good watch at an even better price.

I sent this watch to my five-year old grandson as his birthday gift. He was very proud wearing it because the second hand had a soccer ball on it and the strap did not need adjusting. Besides, he started playing soccer at that time.

I am the type of person who has to have a watch on; I feel lost without it.  Therefore, my watch has to be something that I can wear every day.  But I also wanted something that can go with a dressier outfit.  And this watch is wonderful.  I've heard that Skagen is a good brand and it's true.  It's very lightweight, beautiful (I love the little crystals at each number), and durable.  Great buy

I bought this for almost 50% less than it sells in the local department store and am happy with my purchase.   The only trouble I have had is with the clasp.  It is a little tricky and you have to make sure that is catches correctly.  I found my watch on the floor recently because the clasp came open

It's not the most expensive watch but it doesn't have to be. It's a looker of a watch. Classy,clean and sharp looking. Mesh band on the wrist (any- I have a Skagen also) is most comfortable and easy to use and sure locking. Terrific buy & price

The watch is extremely reliable. I've had it three years and it's never lost time and is running on the original battery. I wear it every day so it takes a lot of abuse. It's simple design is elegant enough for me to wear to work or out for a casual evening, but casual enough for me to wear on weekends. The mesh band is the most comfortable band you will ever wear, you don't even feel it against your skin. I have a two-tone Movado and I far prefer my $89 Skagen to my $900 Movado.  My Skagen is also easy to read the time. I just love it more than I can say. I own numerous watches, many from Switzerland. But the Skagen is the KING of my lifetime watch collection. Simplicity as its very BEST

The learning curve on this watch if you use it for fishing may take some time.  The moon phase is nice to know about and the sunrise and sunset is pretty cool too, but I didn't give this watch 5 stars because for the money it didn't give me the one option I used more than any other on previous cheaper watches, a timer.  This one has the stopwatch but there is no timer you can set for say 10 or 15 minutes.  It keeps great time so far, but that's typical of Casio.  The backlight is very bright, enough so that you can almost use it as a flashlight, and the option on this model where you can set it for the backlight to come on everytime you hold your arm a certain way is cool.  If you're looking for a good water proof timepiece and you don't really care about the timer issue, this is the one.  And yeah I'm vain about what it looks like on my arm; it looks manly and cool

My son loves his new Timex watch.  It has an elastic band that is easy for him to slip on and off.  He wears it every day, and he is getting so much better at telling time!  If you push a button the face lights up.  My son enjoys using this to tell time in the dark

The Fossil Watch Bentley Gunmetal, it is an excellent purchase, because it is a watch of high quality and to a good price. If they want to have a quality watch and that it likes the people who know, they do not doubt in buying it

apart of great look and seem durability, it is strange feature in such kind of dial. You have chronograph, but you do not have idea where it stops. 23 or 26 seconds? Difficult to find out with such a dial..

even if you are not, buy this watch.  I am a nurse, much like many of the other reviewers.  In fact, I bought it due to their reviews.  It is a fantastic watch.  Easy to read, has an illumination option and a handy date feature.  The only trouble I have is the size of the band (too long).  I will take it to a jeweler to take a few links out, however, the directions for doing this yourself make it looks easy (it's not).  Don't even bother looking for another watch, this one is a steal

I was a little surprised at the size and weight of this watch, its almost 0.5in thick, and the bezel is a full 1.5in across so the case is a bit bigger than that.  The mineral glass crystal seems substantial and durable, but the clarity is just average.  In addition to having glow-in-the-dark markings (which don't work too well) on the hands and dial-markers, it also has an Indiglo style back-light (which does work well).  The bezel only rotates counter-clockwise, and it seems very tight at first.  Overall, it's a decent everyday watch.

The styling on this watch is very nice.  The silver and the grey colors look really good. The lightweight titanium is great and the size is just right. Now for what I don't like about it...first after purchasing online I took it to a jewelry store to have a couple of links taken out...I'm out $15 for that. The the clasp pin has broken twice another $20 for repair. And the watch is LOUD.  When I'm driving to work or am sitting in the office and everything is quiet I can hear the ticking....I don't guess that should bother me..but it does

I bought this watch because I wanted something inexpensive, but still professional looking.  I like the lightness of the watch, the thin size, and the simple design.  It does make an audible ticking sound that is louder than I would like, but still not very noticeable.  

If you haven't seen other comments about getting the watch sized, pay attention.  I took it to a professional jewelry repair shop, and they still couldn't remove some extra links without leaving some minor scratches.  I would recommend having any size adjustments done by a professional jeweler who has been selling this brand of watch for a while.  The jeweler I went to has a good reputation, but does not sell Skagen.

The Casio G-Shock Atomic Solar Watch #GW1400DA-4AV is sort of middle of the road in terms of price (I paid $99). It's not cheap but it's not too expensive either. The display diameter is not large but it is a thick, tough-looking watch (a real man's watch... :) ). It's also on the heavy side. So, if you're looking for an elegant, thin watch, look somewhere else.

When I first got it, the power source was at 50% charge. After leaving the watch on my desk facing up towards a desk fluorescent lamp that was left on, the charge reached 100% the next day. The solar cell seems to be working. The time is accurate too. I checked it against the computer time (which also gets synched everyday). It comes with a small manual (with very small text), but I found that there's really no need to use the manual at all initially. It works right out of the box and all the factory settings were correct. (The manual will come in useful when you have some time on your hands to browse through it to get a clearer idea of all the available features.)

The watch's steel wristband was much too large for me and I had to shorten it (removed 4 links, actually). I used a Swiss army knife blade to accomplish the task. The knife tip has to be strong enough to apply pressure to the spring loaded rod that holds the links together, but small to get into the small area between the wrist band metal links (watch for the arrows: these tell you where to apply the pressure). You need to push down on the ridges of the rod, and out (away from you). (Down, so that you can make the rod shorter, and out so that when the rod is shortened, the wrist band link will pop out). I did accidentally scratch the band but it wasn't too bad since the scratch was on the inside. (It's easy enough to shorten the wristband and almost everyone who gets this watch will have to do this.) Be careful not to slice your finger open. Always turn the blade away from your finger when applying the pressure.

Overall, I give it 2 thumbs up for looks and functionality.

(Note: this watch is sold by multiple vendors on Amazon. You should check for the one that has the best price. When I bought it, I wasn't aware of this but found out later, a little too late)

As other people have pointed out, this is a very solid watch. I really am not afraid of it breaking if it falls, or anything like that. However, this is partly due to its enormous thickness. It's not that the diameter of the watch is surprisingly large - it's how thick it is. If you have a small wrist, this watch is probably not for you, as it will be very noticeable. It's also not especially light, obviously, but it feels comfortable enough.

It keeps excellent time, and I've had no problems with the automatic signal searching

This watch is great. It recharges itself, self adjusts with the atomic clock, world time, auto lighting, etc... just to mention a few features. As this is from the G shock series, it is really sturdy and scratch/water/weather/heat/shock resistant! It has both the digital and the analog hand to view the time(whichever is convenient). This synchronizes with the atomic clock(time and the daylight savings) which means you need not adjust the time. Another interesting feature is that if you tilt your hand in the dark towards you then the watch lights up showing you the time!

There are a few cons. There is no seconds hand on it(but there is a digital second indicator). This watch is slightly heavy and huge. But after a few months you get adjusted to it. You need to go through the manual as there are so many features and you have only four buttons

this is a very nice, affordable watch.  i like not having to replace batteries and knowing that it will ALWAYS be accurate.

people who own $1000+ watches ask me about it a lot.  when i tell them that it is solar powered and automatically synchronizes with an atomic clock every night, and that i only paid $60 for it while on sale from amazon, they immediately tell me that they paid too much for their expensive inferior watches

I bought this watch as a gift for a friend who requested this exact one.  He loves it.   Personally the lights that come on and off far too frequently for no reason would be a little too much for me.  It is certainly the largest wrist watch I have come across but if this is what you're looking for and knowing that it is a G-Shock which makes it a great watch, this is the one for you

The watch is an excellent timekeeper.  Automatic calibration really works (although some reviews I'd read indicate otherwise).  I like the dial, features, (changes to dst, calendar knows how many days in a month,etc.)   Do not, though, travel with this watch for a while without the instruction book.   The four control buttons take some time to figure out, and most of them are so rarely used that when you do need the stopwatch, or one of the various other options, you'll likely need the book (at least I did).  Also understand that this is a BIG watch--probably at least twice as thick as the watch you're used to and considerably heavier.  It will hang up on a jacket or anything with long sleeves.   The G shock, though, is tougher than a hammer and if you don't mind the bulk I'd recommend it.  RLM in Iow

I've seen very inconsistant reviews for Silver Insanity items.  I received this necklace for Christmas last year, and it's pretty nice.  Generally I always receive a compliment when I wear it.  For the price, it's worth it. If you're looking for something nicer, you're simply going to have to pay more

I bought this watch for my husband and he absolutely loves it.  He has received many compliments.  It is high quality and arrived in perfect condition.  It is great as an everyday watch and still nice enough to wear for dressier occasions as well.  Almost bought the watch at a dept. store, but saved $25 using amazon.  Great product!

I recieved this watch for Christmas and I'm still blown away looking at it.  Had to take it to a jewelry shop to remove a link (my wrists are small) because the links are difficult to do themselves, but that's probably just for emphasis on quality.  It came in a Fossil christmas tin, very well packaged.  I'm very satisfied and recommend it for someone looking for a nice dress watch for their collection

Recently I got into a more "grown up" field (commercial real estate) and decided I had to look the part.  I decided I needed a great watch to go with those new Brooks Brothers suits and got an Invicta Speedway.  At over a little more than a hundred bucks it was the greatest deal of my life.  I get compliments on it, especially from women, almost EVERY SINGLE DAY.  Several of my older colleagues mistook it for a Rolex Daytona and flipped when I told them the price.  I highly recommend it.

Furthormore,  I have found that INVICTA is an amazing watch company to say the least.  Around the same time I also bought the 8926 Pro Diver to use as my casual watch and also get endless compliments.  It is amazing that I got both of these watches for less money than a run of the mill Seiko or Citizen.  They will have have my money and compliments for years to come

It's a great watch for the price.  I think I paid $130 for it. It runs great, keeps good time, and is probably one of the best watches you can get for the money.  High quality work, very close in look/feel/weight to a R*lex.  We'll have to see how the gold plating wears over time, but other than that, it's a great watch

Believe it, this is a stunningly beautiful watch and no one will guess the price unless you tell them.  It gets more attention than my gold Rolex!

As for the weight, it is normal for stainless which means a solid feel and you know it's there.  If someone wants a flyweight watch why would they buy stainless steel?

It reliably functions exactly as described.  You'll love this watch.  Buy the 5-year extended warranty for $25 and enjoy it.

P.S.  If you need to remove links, just put a smoothed paperclip in a vice to push the pins out.  No big deal

The watch was even more attractive than it appeared. I had none of the noise problems that were described in other reviews. The mesh bracelet is not as comfortable as the leather bands I am used to. In low light it is sometimes difficult to see (my eyesight is good). But basically I am very satisfied

I read the reviews on this diamond just before Christmas when it was on sale for $99.00. The diamonds are better then expected and I consider them to be a fine purchase for 99 bucks. No visible flaws. I am sure if I used a loop I could find some but no visible yellow on these and the clarity is fair. Their great for $99.00 diamonds

My friends purchased this watch for me in 1998 as a graduating college/leaving for the Army gift.  I have worn it daily for nine years.  It survived the hardships of an Army lifestyle (I wore it daily then, too) and is still going strong.  I have replaced the battery once and had to have the date bezel removed (the thin silver border) because it popped out after my toddler daughter beat on it on the ground various times (yes, I should have moved it to a higher location).  The lens has minor scratches, but nothing that deters from its simple function and aesthetic charm.  This watch has never failed me.  It is simply the best, most durable, watch that I have ever owned

I'm a pretty big guy so it doesn't look out of place, but this is really an extra large watch that is also quite heavy.  It runs well, keeps good time and the movement has a very good reputation for reliability.  If you're an extra large person and don't mind a heavy watch, you may be interested in this.  If you're average size or smaller, I wouldn't recommend it.  Personally, this is my weekend watch because it comes across as being pretty bullet-proof in normal use

Yeah, it's a money clip alright.  Going from an overfilled wallet down to a 5 card/cash only clip was surprisingly easy.  I found that I was carrying a whole lot of "stuff" in my wallet that I didn't need and was just causing my wallet to get bigger and bigger.

With just 5 cards, a couple receipts and a little cash this clip is much more comfortable, easier to manage, and looks a lot better than my old wallet.

I do agree with the previous reviewer about the clip forcing the cash to bunch up under the clasp when it's closed.  However, it doesn't take long for it to become second nature to keep the cash pulled out a bit before securing it down.

I haven't used any other money clips so I can't compare this one to others, but if you use a wallet I can say that this is, hands down, my new preference

I've had this for a week, it may not function as well in a year, and that is something you might want to keep in mind reading this.

So far, however, it's been a great replacement for a wallet. Don't get me wrong, I still have my wallet and will likely use it when travelling. But for everyday use this is far more practical and comfortable to carry. It's also as easy on the eyes as it is in the pocket - equally pleasant to carry and look at.

Feels sturdy and durable; light but not flimsy. This can hold upto 5 cards and maybe 20 bill notes.

Be warned, however, although the clip does hold 5 credit card-sized cards (ID's, and whatever else you may have) it is only really easy to remove the topmost and bottom most cards. That is, if you have 5 cards you use quite often you may want to look else where.

Personally, I have an ID on the top and my credit card on the bottom. The other three cards are ones I almost never use, or use very rarely.

One of the concerns I had purchasing this is whether or not it will securly hold less than 5 cards. It does (there are pressure clips on the sides of where the card goes in), but I wouldn't recommend it. Just didn't feel safe enough, even with 4 cards.

Something I did not foresee purchasing this is that the clip secures the money very tightly. Consequently: 1) When you press down the clip, it drags the money back a few millimeters. If you put the money in too far back it'll crumple it up. 2) When secured, you can't just pull out a bill, you will have to lift the clip up. The first point I've found a little more bothersome than the second, but after playing around with it for half an hour or so I've got the hang of clamping it without crumpling the money.

That being said, it really is a very nice item and would be an awesome gift to give to a friend, husband, father, or for your own personal use - if it suites their or your dress style.

(If you are wondering why it is a 4 star and not a 5... well, for no real good reason. It does deserve 5 stars, but the little issues with the clip tugging on the money as you clamp it down - although it means money is held more securely - that holding less than 5 cards didn't feel too secure, and pulling out any card other than the top and bottom most cards is difficult, dropped it down to a 4. It may just be that these are issues that were neccessary to keep the product as fanatastic as it is. 4.5 stars might have been a welcome option, this is as close to perfect as it gets.

They are comfy and I am able to wear them for long periods of time where with some other metals I can not. The thing is I have smaller ears than some people so the stones are a little big for my ears I think but other than that they are just fine

  I just recently had my ears pierced and needed something small that I could wear continually on a daily casual basis without the earrings looking too dressy.  These earrings are just perfect for that purpose.   They are simple elegance with genuine pearls and sterling silver findings.  They are even confortable enough to wear while sleeping. I am wearing the white pearl set right now.  Love them!

I love these!  They are such a good deal for the price, and come in a nice box.  They are much better than what I was expecting. : )  Colours are a nice pastel, and would go with lots of different things.  Pearls are large but not too large - just right

We happened across these as a Gold Box item, and decided they were the perfect size and color for our daughter as an Easter present.  They came nicely packaged, and are some of her favorites.  My wife now wants the same in different colors :

These earrings are really pretty.  There are not real great variations in the color between each set (they are all pastel, after all!) but each has a beautiful sheen and color.

They are also set very firmly on the backs - I was worried that, for the price, they wouldn't hold up.  But they are very nicely made.

The packaging was okay, but not deluxe.  What I appreciated was that there was a little flyer enclosed telling how to take care of pearls, which I found informative.

All in all a good purchase and well worth the money

I am very pleased with the pretty shades of the pearls and the size was even bigger than I expected.  The only thing that would have them even better was bigger flat backings.  I have very small ear lobes so they flopped forward.  I remedied that by changing the backings.  I am wearing them with so many things and really enjoying them

As with all natural pearls, the shapes are not perfect. Only cultured pearls are perfect, because man controls them. The dye is uniform and the size is perfect, big enough that they can be seen easily.  The colors; pink, white, gold, and lavender are clear.  Even the green is a clear green, just not my favorite green

I was skeptical about this watch because of the very low price but I was very pleasantly surprised. It has a quality finish and band, is comfortable, and works great here on the East Coast. It reliably synchs with the Colorado time signal so it's always accurate. Great watch for the money, I highly recommend this yellow dial watch and its black and blue dial siblings

I purchased one of the Casio Men's Atomic Waveceptor Yellow Dial Watch #VQ200HDA-9BVCF from amazon. This watch is great, it updates the time automatically (just switched to daylight savings and I didn't have to touch a thing).Instructions say to position watch in a window or where it has view to the sky for updates, My watch was in a drawer under a marble top and it updated just fine.I saw in other reviews complaints about the plastic back, this is a must to allow the auto updates. Again, Cool Looking,Great Watch!!!!

This watch is pretty much exactly what you would expect from the picture. The case is a bit thick and the backplate is plastic, but that might reduce overall weight and compensate for the size. It certainly doesn't feel like the lead weight my fossil watches seem to be. I have a smaller than average wrist and it was easily sizable down with the proper tools. Atomic time reception is good even as far south as I am and it rarely misses updates. You can force an update if you feel like it and its really easy.  What is not easy is the initial setup.  I've never had to really read a manual on most electronics, but you will need it with this one.  Keep that in a safe place for when the battery dies.  At least for now, the price is a deal for the functionality and quality

Hello all, you cannot go wrong with this watch. It is a very good looking watch. The web does it no justice. Great Deal for the money. This is the most expensive watch I have ever had, I have always worn Timex, but no more. The features in the Perpetual Calendar and the Kinetic and it also has a Leap Year Calendar, which I did not need, but no problem. If the watch sets still for more than 12 hours it actually stops. Then the moment you pick it back up it automatically reset's itself, pretty cool feature. When I received it, the watch blew me away. It was delivered quickly and tags were attached and I registered it with [....................]. I can go on........I give it 10 stars if it would let me!!!!! Enjoy.

I love this watch, I've had it for almost a year.  Its absolutely beautiful, but simple. It keeps time very well.  For the work I do I don't wear this watch to work.  So I can go sometimes a full week without wearing it.  The hands stop after sitting still for 24 hours but as soon as I pick it back up and give it a shake, the hands spin around and sets itself.  Its not to dressy for casual wear, but it also fits perfectly with a suit and tie. I highly recommend it!

I bought this watch as a gift for my boyfriend, and he was pleasantly surprised to say the least.  The human-powered kinetic movement of the watch really appeals to the gadget lover in any guy, and the sapphire crystal face of the watch will not scratch.  Although I bought the black-faced Kinetic Coutoura Seiko, the gold/silver version of this watch is lovely also.  Great quality, gorgeous appearance, reasonable price - definitely consider this watch

First impressions: It's a nice watch with a clear look. I was a little worried about the lack of backlighting, but was pleasantly suprised that I was able to see the luminescent dials clearly at any hour of the night.

Pros: Quick atomic time synchronization (usually within one to two minutes after the initial synchronization). Simple to use. 

Cons: Case is described as stainless steel, but back piece is plastic. Originally listed by Amazon as a solar-powered watch, but instead powered by regular battery. Battery life expectancy about 2 years, though it may lost longer by disabling the auto-sync feature.

Overall comments: This is my first atomic time wrist-watch. It automatically synchronizes with atomic time once at midnight (a function you can disable if desired) or on-demand with the press of a button or two. It does this by scanning for a radio signal. According to the instructions, you're supposed to leave this watch near a window with the 6-o'clock side facing the window for best radio-signal reception. Reception can of course vary depending on your location, but the watch has successfully updated several times even while I was wearing it.
I like watches with flat crystal surfaces, because it allows me to paste a PDA screen-proctector (cut to size, of course) on them, which keeps the crystal from scratching. The crystal on this watch is only slightly curved, and in only one direction, meaning a screen protector sticks nicely and evenly to it.
The watch is waterproof to 50 meters, which (in Casio terms) means you can go swimming with it, but you should not press any buttons underwater. I try to keep my watches away from water when I can, but it's always good to know that it should survive most water-related mishaps

I received a lovely pendant necklace several years ago, and wear it everywhere, but my long hair always tangles in the chain and trying to get the hair out usually breaks the chain.  I average buying about 4 new chains a year.  Since purchasing this chain, my hair is not tangled nor ripped out by the links, clothing fiber doesn't catch on it, my pendant does not get stuck on the clasp-in short, this is the worlds most perfect chain!  I cannot tell you how happy I am with this purchase

The watch was shipped in a timely manner, actually I receive the watch a few days sooner than the expected delivery date. I purchased this product as a gift for my son.  When I opened the package it was everything the site said it would be and more. My son and I am very pleased with the watch. I do agree with a previous review stating that this watch is not for a small frame man. Although, this is not a problem for me because my son likes the larger watches, I took it to have it resized for him and it fits perfect

This is a great and stylish watch.  I always get compliments.  It is heavy, sturdy and looks much more expensive than what the actual price was.  It looks great with any suit and looks really good with a nice blue shirt.  Highly recommended.  The stainless steel is much shinnier than what the picture shows.  Ignore the comment below.  You will be happy with this watch!

Had these on my wish list and received them as a gift. They are even more lovely in person. They are one of my favorite pairs - I wear them all the time. They're very simple, yet elegant, and very well made, especially for the price. I will definitely buy more from this company.

I first came across the Silver Insanity line of Celtic jewelry last year, when I was looking for Christmas presents. Jackpot! I confess I spent a good hour and a half looking over their featured items, both on Amazon and on the Silver Insanity website. The teardrop earrings I picked out were quite a success, so much so that I recently went back and got this lovely pair of silver Celtic knot earrings for myself. I've been very happy with my selection, and I just went to pick out some silver starburst earrings as a wedding gift for a friend. I highly recommend the items from Silver Insanity, and plan to order from them again

Having only owned Fossil watches prior to this one I must say that I was a little jaded.  My latest Fossil bit the dust after many long, good years of use.  I happened to find this just browsing one day and was hooked by the color and overall design.  I have to say, I was highly impressed with what I received.  It is an absolutely beautiful watch

Lovely jewelry, great price, but the clasp is pretty tough to work. This is not the necklace for anyone with stiff fingers. I'm also worried that the clasp might not hold up to repeated use and wish it was the more traditional link to link closure than this insert-key type clasp. It's probably a great choice for very occassional use, though with the quality and price, it really is a regular-use type of necklace. I think it's best suited for the nimble-fingered, traditional-fashion person

If you are trying to buy a decent set of pearls and don't really have a good frame of referance - these are for you. My wife was a jewler and she likes pearls. I bought these and got positive feedback. I was nervous but when they showed they were heavy and looked great. You will be OK if you go with these

I ordered this jewelry piece with the gift box and card.  The box, while attractive at first glance, is flimsy, got slightly crushed in transit, and the ribbon on its top is frayed and pasted-on.  The card that came with it is much too large to fit inside the box or even on top gracefully, and the message inside is not centered, making it impossible to trim down.  Said message inside appears to have been written in plain old Times New Roman script.  I could do far better on my own printer, and for the cost, I could get a much more attractive card at a store.  I will say, however, that the piece itself looks every bit as nice as it does in the photos.  I might order from Silver Insanity again, but I'm not paying for any of the "frills"- they just aren't putting enough work into it to make it worth it

These are beautiful earrings.  They are a bit small but the stones are vibrant and rich looking.  My only complaint is that the post part of the earring is not very substantial and I feel as though I need to handle them VERY carefully.  They are extremely comfortable and have just the right amount of movement to them.

I received these earrings today and am delighted with them.  I read the reviews carefully, so I knew the actual size of this item, and the only surprise was how exquisite these little earrings are.  The presentation (bag and box) is beautiful -- looks like materials you would be given in a traditional jewelry store.  I've posted a couple photos in customer images so you can better visualize the size and see what the earrings are housed in

Paid $45 for these and worth every penny.  They are delicate, the color is brilliant, the stones are very clear.  I wore them to work as soon as I got them and received more than a few compliments on them.  They would make a wonderful gift for someone, and even better for yourself

The bracelet didn't look as I expected from looking at the picture, but is very pretty.  I didn't realize it would be so delicate-looking, because there is nothing to compare it to in the image.  It is very nice, though.  It is small/thin, the kind of thing you might wear with a dress, yet seems strong.  The metalwork seems done well and I think it's a bracelet that would be right for wearing someplace special

I bought this for my sister for Christmas.  I have a similar one that is bigger, that I bought while in Charleston, SC.  She fell in love with mine, and since driving 4 hours just to buy a necklace was out of the question, I decided on this one.  At first, when it arrived, I thought it would be too small, but my sister does not wear large neclaces, earrings, etc... Turns out she loved it.  It was just perfect for her, especially since her neck is thin and her complexion is olive

The 18" description is for the necklace on it's longest extended setting.  Without using the extended part of the chain it is really closer to being child sized.  It is pretty and will end up being a gift for my daughter rather than the friend I had intended to give it to

I received this pair of hoop earrings as a Christmas gift from my boyfriend.  When I first open the box, I thought they were earrings for an infant.  The earrings are very very small; however, they are cute.  As I started wearing the earrings, I began to really like them.  They are the smallest pair of earrings in my possession.  If you really like dainty jewelry, I highly recommend this item

I received this watch yesterday and would like to counter some comments in other reviews. The watch I received has no scratches on the crystal. It was packaged nicely. It does not seem too thick. It does not appear cheap or lightweight. Although the back plate and two buttons are plastic, the rest of the watch is sturdy metal, and it feels solid. The wristband is just the right size for me, although I do have a gorilla wrist. I didn't find the manual difficult to understand. The watch attempted to auto-sync overnight, but didn't get a signal, so I manually sync'ed it the next day according to the instructions with no problem. Easy-to-read dial, low price (about $35), overall a great atomic watch worth twice what I paid

Nice watch that keeps super accurate time. However, it is very basic showing only the time and date. It would be nice if it had backlighting, but the hands do glow in the dark for some period of time. It is a little tricky to pick up the time signal so I would recommend finding a place in your home where the signal is strong and leave it there every night.

I ordered these earrings a little over two months ago and I am very happy with them. They are very light weight and they do not pull on your ears. The size is perfect; very "in" right now. You do have to pull on the stem pretty hard to get them off because the clasp is very tight. However, so far, so good. They have not broken and the clasp has not become loose or anything. I even accidentally left them in a pocket once and they were put through the washing machine. They were completely fine afterward. I do wish the earrings had been about $20 less expensive. But, overall I love my earrings

I have had this watch for more than 5 years, and wear it daily. I purchased it in Cayman Is, and I think I paid a lot more than the Amazon price.

I love the Eco-Drive, as it never needs attention. About a year ago, the Eco-Drive mechanism went bad, and I sent it to Citizen. They replaced the mechanism for free, saying it was their issue. Kudos to them on that.

I have been able to scratch the crystal, but only after heavy abuse :) The number band around the outside still turns as well as the day I bought it. The numbers on the metallic band around the face have never worn off, but the outside of the band has a nice smooth edge to it now. 

The lettering wore off the band after about a year, so if you plan to use the dive table that is on the band, don't wear it daily. Else, be smart and carry your own dive table on the old plastic card or on your dive computer. 

The band has now finally worn out after 5 years (which is how I ended up here). The two small strap holders just broke off in the past 2 weeks (they wore through), and the band is cracking but only in the holes (still holds just fine). 

I would buy this watch again, and obviously recommend it.

I have owned this watch for almost 4 years now with absolutely no complaints.  After going through several cheaper watches to wear at work and on a casual basis I decided to spend a few extra bucks to see if I could get more wear out of one and I am sold on this one.  I work in a facility that deals with chemicals that are hard on watches and I also work with mechanical equipment that is hard on crystals and this watch has held up in my working environment quite well. Because I am not a diver, I am not sure that this is a good diving watch but I do fish and play in the Atlantic and this watch has held up through use in the sand and salt with very little care given to it.  I am still on my first band and battery and the watch still keeps accurate time.  The band is starting to crack a bit but, after what I've put this watch through, I am surprised it has held up this long.  The crystal is a tad bit scratched but the other watches that I have had would have blown apart or would at least be cloudy from the blows that it's taken

The first watch had a broken crown the date could not be changed.To amazons credit,they sent me a new one right away.This watch is fine.I needed a rubber band because I am in water a great deal of the time at workand I live near the ocean.I am always in the water with my children.So far the watch is great and has held up to expectations.No problems except when the first one was shipped broken.I would buy it again

I love the look of this watch!  I have enjoyed it for almost two weeks now and it has kept perfect time to date.

Originally I was attracted to the Seiko SKX173 which I came across first.  However I was concerned that the physical size of the Seiko might be too large for my wrist plus reviews indicated its automatic/mechanical movement might not be as accurate as I wanted. 

Later I found this Citizen watch which looks virtually identical, yet it is smaller (diameter 38mm vs 43, height 10.5mm vs 13.5), and has a more accurate battery-driven quartz movement.

It also has a longer warranty (5 years vs 3) which probably indicates that the movement is more likely to be trouble-free than the self-winding Seiko.

The only negative I have encountered is that it (as well as the Seiko) come with a fairly bulky rubber strap.  While this is more comfortable than I expected, it does tend to interfere somewhat with the drape of the cuff when wearing a long sleeve shirt.

I wanted to buy a claddagh ring for my son - and came upon this ring.  When it arrived, I really was in awe of just how beautiful it is!  It is a larger, more bold ring - definitely more masculine.  This is a gorgeous gift for someone looking to buy a quality piece of jewelry for someone they love.
It's too bad that the ring will eventually be outgrown because my boy is only 12. Hopefully I can have it resized later or find another one that is this nice

My fiance is a horse finatic.  I bought pendant as a present for her.  When I received it, I was impressed with the detail.  It is lovely and shines as only silver does, and I know I'll get big-time brownie points when she opens it on X-mas.  Also a great stocking-stuffer

Sounds a little strange, but I needed another digital watch just to have a hourly chime, so that I could do hourly "reality checks" that make it possible for you to have lucid dreams. Ok, nevermind. Check out Stephen Laberge's books for more on that.

I've had it for only a couple of weeks - bought it at a certain nationwide store that has a crosshair symbol as the emblem -  and then accidentally saw this page on Amazon, so I thought I'd review it.  

It's very comfortable as another review said. 
It looks great.  At first, I was a little self conscious about wearing this big thing when I first got it home and tried it on, but come to think of it, it's not that much bigger than my Seiko diver's

I'd highly recommend it. Defintely happy with it, even though I won't be using most of the many features on it

My boyfriend found this watch at a retail store & put it on his Christmas list.  I purchased it at Amazon at a much better price.  This was a replacement watch for an old Timex watch.  My boyfriend says he loves this watch - no complaints at all.  He says the buttons are easier to push than those on his old watch & he especially likes the large, easy to read display.

Amazon shipped the watch very quickly, it arrived two days before they said it would and I was very happy with the weight and styling of the watch.  "A good purchase" I think to myself.  The only piece of styling I was not happy about was the large magnifier above the date on the watch, which is not visible on the amazon photos. When I pulled out the crown to set the time and date I got that sinking feeling that something wasnt right, and that feeling was followed by the whole crown comming out of the watch.  I was able to put it back in and set the time, but setting the date was not possible.  I used Amazons online return procedure, filling out an HTML entry field box about the problem and printed out postage and a barcode to put in the box.  I took it to the post office and the shipping was free, although the post office was not able to insure the shipment which kind of worried me.  That was 4 days ago and I still havent heard anything from amazon about the return, although they did say expect 5-9 days to process returns.  I hope it all goes well and I get a replacent watch.  I did read about this same problem on other Amazon reviews for similar watches by Invicta, so it is worth looking into before purchasing.

I ordered these for my 18 month old daughter, and was a little nervous, I had never bought earrings on line before, I wanted something with the safety backs, but I had expereince with some backs that "screw themselves off".  I loved the butterflies and wanted to try them!  My daughter has had them in her ears for a few weeks now and we haven't had any problems!  I keep checking the backs and they are on nice and tight.  I wanted a good quality earring so she didn't have problems with infections...and we havent!  I will definately order from here again

Sometimes, you realize you need a watch but don't want to spend a fortune, something that'll last long, is solid, yet fashionable and easy to use. This watch has it all, many times girls have stopped me to see this watch, it is sophisticated, stylish, and only $85 no matter where you go. The metal stays shiny, the glass, virtually scratch proof. Days of the week, military time, day of month (problem with this is it does not know, if month is 30 days or 31, so u have to set it yourself sometimes, but rarely, and worth the effort) I highly reccomend this watch to everyone

I bought this at a fossil store for $85, and its worth every cent. It has the time, day of week, date, and military time. Its waterproof up to 100 meters. It has a double lock to stay on your arm. It is glow in the dark. It has a spinning number thing. It looks good and is always shinny. its only 85 bucks. ITS PERFECT!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I bought this set for my wife as a valentine's day gift. She really liked them! They are a good size and color, so they give a striking impression from a distance. The earrings come in little plastic ziplock bags all packed inside a not too special velvety bag. If you purchase this as a gift, go the extra step and get something to make a better presentation. I went to wally-world and bought a $3 wooden jewelry box, which conveniently enough had a heart-shaped decorative glass in the top. It was well received.

I actually bought these two years ago, then again for my mother this past Christmas. We both love the sets. They're great for someone looking to start or expand their collection. The colors of the stones were very nice and equally matched. Nice size, not too small, not too big.

  This is not the first tool I'ld add to my work bench, but it has some pieces I'm glad to have.  I re-sized my watch band in just a few minutes and only had one little incident with doing something the wrong way.  Did I mention that the instructions are somewhat lacking?  In hind-sight I should have figured it out before I made the mistake, but that's hind-sight for you.  If your good with working with tools, and you have a need to adjust a watchband at least every Christmas, then this is a good deal

I don't know for whom watchebands are sized.  Perhaps the Incredible Hulk in his green phase?  All I know is I'm constantly resizing my watchband based on the band, the climate, my activities.  This procedure can be somewhat difficult with some bands.  This complete kit does the trick.  A couple of minutes and a clear spot on my desk and I'm done.  Couldn't get much simpler.  I finally got this kit after wrestling with a new Fossil band that would not cooperate.  Used this kit and the bugger was vanquished in a trice.  Wish I had it years ago

Great kit for working with watches.  The tools were quite good quality, and not flimsy and cheap.  The case was also good, and thankfully wasn't just the typical throw away plastic crap.  The inside of the case is firm foam that keeps the tools nicely in place.  The case itself is firm black leather-like  material and snaps closed.  The kit contains a hammer, band holding base, and several different sized pin drivers for removing band pins.  Also includes the clamp type pin remover (the blue thing), a set of screwdrivers and a thin but sturdy wedge for removing watch backs.  All in all I'm quite pleased with the product.  It was just what I wanted and wasn't very expensive

Atomic watches are highly-accurate quartz watches which are synchronized each day with a time signal broadcast from the definitive U.S. Atomic Clock in Ft. Collins, Colorado. Thus, all atomic watches are always accurate to within a fraction of a second at any time. Since atomic watches adjust automaticaly to and from daylight saving time they are the ultimate in accurate watches. Casio makes -- and Amazon sells -- a wide selection of styles of atomic watches to suit various needs and tastes, but all are equally accurate. The Casio G-Shock series is especially rugged and the solar powered models, such as this, never require battery replacement. Atomic accurary, solar power, and G-Shock ruggedness is an appealing combination at a quite reasonable price

Keeps time very well(obviously).  No problems getting signal to sync with atomic clock.  Chrono, second time zone, all other functions work well.  Love the light function, better than any Indiglo I have owned.  Only quibble is that the alarm needs to be louder

This is the best G-Shock I have owned. It looks sleek as well as casual. I had no trouble receiving the nightly signal (I live in Northern New Jersey). The solar power is an added bonus. A really good deal for the money

I've had a couple of casio watches in the past, pathfinders to gshocks. This watch is not too big, though it has a pretty thick face, the material looks and feels pretty sturdy.

Setting of the watch is not too difficult, it's similar to other casio watches. I did not have problems getting the hands to match the digital time, it appeared to do it automatially, although i believe you have a feature to intentionally set them out of sync. Radio atomic reception is great, (Austin, Tx). The light is based of two led's on the left and right of the watch face. Although it's not as bright/easy to read as the full illuminator watches that casio/timex has, it sufficiently lights up the screen to read the time, and is quite pretty.

Pro's
-great value, for 79 usd, you get gshock, solar, atomic, metal band
-as a previous reviewer mentioned, you can remove links from the watch in about 10-15 mins with a sharp tipped knife

Con's
-A little heavy
-Digital readout is tiny but adequate (the watch can actually display the current time of day in that tiny circular lcd panel)
-No countdown timer
-Alarm is really short and pretty soft, but that seems to be the case of all casio solar watche

I'm a bit of a collector it seems (by as many watches I've accumulated and rotate out in use)... And I'd compare this watch to my others (Citizen, Seiko, Vostok, Casio) quite well.

Band is well built and easy to resize myself with the tool.  No problems with losing time (wish these things did DST themselves!!!), and date, although somewhat hard to read, does its job.

The numbers on the dial are easy to read and each one (1...12) are phospholuminescent and easy to read in the dark with normal light exposure.

The watch isn't heavy, nor is it on the light side for waches like this, and having buttons on the side has proved useful when timing things - sit-up competitions, runs, etc...

Overall very pleased

Since I had never purchased a watch by Croton, I did not know what to expect.  The watch came in 2 boxes, the first being a black cardboard box detailing the Croton brand in silver on the top center of the lid.  Inside of this box, the watch itself is encased in a nice padded black leather case with the Croton name embossed on the top center of the lid.  On the inside of the lid, there is a "pocket" that stores the instruction guide and a warranty card, which is neatly concealed behind a black piece of material with the Croton logo in silver text.  Needless to say, I will feel good presenting this gift to my boyfriend.

The watch itself has substance to it.  The shape of the watch face is unique as it looks like a more rounded rectangle. The face is blue, and what is nice is that there is a bit of light texturing on the face.  The blue color seems to change from dark to lighter depending on the lighting in the room.  The numbers are clearly visible, but the date is a bit on the small side, but not terrible.  When I took the watch out of the case, I noticed that it was not running and at first, I feared that the watch battery was dead.  This was not the case however, I found that the watch pin on the side was pulled out, which had stopped the watch.  I am not sure why this was done, perhaps it is done to conserve the watch battery?  

The back of the watch has the Croton name etched into the center and underneath, it states that it has a sapphire crystal, Japanese quartz movement and the water resistant details. As for the bracelet, it does not seem to be as heavy as I thought it would be, but I will have a better idea after my boyfriend tries it on.  However, I am expecting that he will need to get the watch sized to fit his wrist, but this not at all surprises me as this has been common practice with many of his watches.  As other reviews mention, the instruction booklet is not for this specific watch and is not so helpful.  

All in all, I think this is a nice watch.  Its design is simple, yet elegant.  I think it will be a good business casual watch, as it can be dressed up for the office, yet be worn after hours and on weekends.  Another nice feature is the fact that it is water resistan

I just received this watch and I have to say it's very sharp looking not to mention has some weight to it. This is not a flimsy watch by any means. It's all stainless steel and the clasp is the easiest I have ever had to negotiate of all the watches I have gone through over the years. It's very secure lock yet simple to unclasp. I would recommend this watch to anyone. Also, it's dressy and casual ~ all purpose watch

I ordered this watch for my husband.  He absolutely loved it!  The
watch band is designed narrower at the point where it connects with the watch.  My Husband especially like that design because he says he can wear it for extended periods without the band pinching or rubbing his wrist.  I was unsure what the quality would be because of the low price, however the watch was an excellent quality product. tmccann, F

This is my 2nd one. That's just because I dropped the other one on my hard tile a few too many times and was tired of sending it in to get fixed.(it was just the watch face that broke, the watch kept on ticking) All you have to do is read the simple directions on entering your age, weight, sex and hit start during your work out. When you're done you can see your average heart rate during your workout, the length of your workout and the calories burned. There are many other things you can do with it such as set an alarm if your heart rate gets too high/too low, set an alarm to wake you up from your power nap, do lap times, etc

It is so detailed, even the tiny thorns are so delicate and perfectly placed. This is such a beautiful piece of jewellery that no woman should be without. This Valentine's Day (or anniversary or birthday) instead of buying your woman chocolates that she doesn't need or flowers that will die after a few days, buy her a gorgeous, unique rose that will last forever

THe charm is gorgeous... Any mother would love it from their husband or children. But okay if you are buying this necklace for a mother under the age of 30 they will be okay with the length of the chain, if you are buying the chain especially for a woman who is over the age of 40 they might be bothered by the short chain.. or if they have a large neck not saying my mother has a large neck she just has three surgery scars that the short rubbing chain bothers

Ever notice how hard it is to find a watch that really fits the arm of your 6-year-old? Not any more. This not only gave my kids a watch that actually fits, it was fun for them to assemble them, and they are still mixing up the colors of the bands. You can simply add or subtract links to get the perfect fit. The different links provided means if it breaks, there's plenty of spares. There's no spare clasp pieces, so if they break the clasp, they're done, but the clasps are quite sturdy, the kids have broken a couple of links without breaking the clasps already. They have learned to be aware of the watch on their wrist, so they haven't broken any more links since the first few days (and there's twice as many links as what we need). 

Overall, this was a great product that my kids enjoy.

If your little guy or gal is struggling with telling time and is a Lego fan this is the best deal money can buy. Under $20 and is expandable etc. Probably not the most durable diver type watch you'll ever buy but it is really good looking, easy to assemble (it's a Lego) and all the kids think it's neat to boot

His wrist was too small for mens, too masculine for a womans watch but way too grown up for those babyish kiddie watches.  This IS the perfect accessory for all of your LEGO maniacs! Fun to re-design as well

These watches are awesome.  My two sons, ages 6 and 8 are crazy about them.   They get to customize it to their own likings which makes it easy to tell their watches apart.  When they get tired of it being the same way they just change the Lego pieces around (which helps them in patterning skills and math) and they have a different watch.  My 8 year old had no issue changing his around but the 6 year old might have touble with this since the peices are tiny and snap tightly in to place (that's what Mom's are for).  This is a great beginner's watch but also large enough for older users.  I wore it and thought it was great as well.  It was very fun to wear, everytime I looked down at it I smiled.  In the day and age of digital mania, it is nice to have something so fun for the children to be able to tell "regular" time.  The price was very reasonable especially when the chances of it being lost are very great.  I highly recommend this watch.  I wish they had girl colors

I purchased this watch for my 7 year old son. It is a eye catching and because it's Lego, it was an instant hit. It has numbers on the face (not Roman numerals or lines) which is important when they are beginning to tell time. The price is fair. The only complaint he has is that it is very difficult to put on and because the band is plastic...it gets a bit sweaty.  All in all it's a fun, "Cool!" watch.

The keyring is very nice.  I had no idea just how light titanium is.  The caps screw on and while the engineering and tolerances are quite tight, it's easy to see the caps coming unscrewed, making the ring kinda useless.  Definately advised to crank the caps on very tightly after putting your keys on it.

Additinally, the metal is quite plyable and i've had to stop myself many times from bending the ring while fidgiting with my keys.

i must say i was hesitant to buy after reading the reviews, but they are for my two year old, so i figured they really couldn't be too small. and they are not. i also purchased other earring from some other vender for a lot more $, and guess what, the quality of theese is soooo much better. all in all, yes they are tiny, but very cute and don't lack detail! will buy again

I bought this watch for my 5 yr old and though it works just fine, the watchband is WAY too big for him.  Fortunately, I am handy with a sewing machine and was able to take a pinch in the band, but it makes it bulky and uncomfortable.  Therefore, he only wears it in bed so that he can play with the indiglo feature in the dark.  As soon as he gets up in the morning, though, he takes it off.

These earrings are quite nice.  Yes they do look brown up to the light, but they are a definite red when backed with any type of shadow.  They can be worn to accent an elegant look, or add style to a "Friday" casual look. They may not be heirloom quality, but could last quite a long time in the modern costume jewelry category.

I bought this as a present for my daughter. I was very pleased with the quality and the finish of the ring. (If anyone wants additional instructions about how to put it together, check wikipedia. I believe there is even a video.) I highly recommend this ring for people who enjoy sterling silver, symbolism, and something just a little bit different

This is a very nice watch. The pink mother-of-pearl face is lovely to look at and the leather strap is very soft. The date is a little small but the watch is so nice that I didn't even care. The only complaint I have is that Amazon sent me this watch with a dead battery inside. I had to get a new battery on my own, but as soon as I told Amazon, they credited me the $10. That was great, but they should have sent me a watch in working condition. Otherwise, the watch is highly recommended. Even nicer than in the photo

I like the stop watch functions that this watch has.  I also like the seperate dials for the different timekeeping functions.  Unfortunately, this watch is hard to read in bright light. Such as sunlight and well lit spaces.  Overall though, I like this watch because it looks good.  Well, it looks good on me anyway

I have owned this watch for over a month now and I can note the following:

The watch has a diameter of approximately 40mm and is around 10mm thick. Both these number seem average and it looks good on an average size wrist.

The watch is a bit heavy, but sits comfortably on the wrist. The bracelet rarely pulls the hair, although I have plenty of it.

The watch is easy to accumulate scratches, but not on the glass. I have scratched the steel around the glass (as well as other places), but the sapphire resists remarkably.

The time keeping is very accurate, compared to the atomic clock on the web. After a month it has advanced less than half a second ahead, which will result in a six second difference at most per year. I guess results may vary between different watches, but it seems nevertheless impressive and trustworthy enough.

The timer is very easy to start, stop and reset, with one button pushes. Very fast and convenient.

The alarm can barely be heard, so is not appropriate for waking. It is useful though for reminders, in a noise free location. Not difficult to set, but takes some time, comparable with setting an alarm on a cell phone. Since it is relative to the secondary time keeping mechanism, you can have a second time zone set and advance the alarm relative to that.

This watch does not seem to attract special attention to it and has not gained any comments so far, without me bringing it in a conversation. Is pretty conservative, but I personally like that.

The price of this watch in amazon seems to fluctuate between 100 and 140 dollars. If the price is higher than 130, I would wait a tad, but not hold my breath too long. It is definately worth the money though, since i have seen several Seiko watches like this one enter their 20 or 30 years of age and still continue strong. For a dependable, accurate, water proof watch for every occasion, most probably you cannot do better than this

I couldn't belive my eyes when I saw diamond earrings with such an affordable price! I definitely think that selecting white gold is the way to go because it won't distract from the mesmerizing glamour of the diamonds. All my friends were wowed and shared that they will also consdier buying a pair. I am so happy.

These earrings are very small, maybe somewhere between 3 and 4mm each. They do appear white, (I don't see any yellow tinting)  with a slight, slight bit of grey, which I prefer over a super white look (as you might sometimes find in a cz). These earrings catch the light nicely, showing a bit of rainbow effect. They aren't super, super sparkly or faceted, but they do possess shine and detail. I am very happy with these earrings as they are just what I wanted: something petite and real, set in yellow gold, and with a nice, clean and "believably" sparkly look! I also like the fit of the earrings backs, very tight and secure.

I bought these for my wife and she liked them very much.  7mm is not as small as you may think.  I certainly wouldn't buy anything larger in this style.  I got them on sale for $15.00, can't go wrong with that price for 14K gold

I bought these earrings as a Christmas gift for my wife and they look great.  My wife has long dark hair and the 7mm size really stands out.  They came in a dark blue velvet jewel/ring box which comes in another dark blue box.  My wife really loves them so that's a bonus for me.  They are a nice little something for yourself or as a gift

These earrings just arrived, and for $10 (Friday sale), you cannot beat this value.  Luckily I bought two pair, one as a gift, and one for me, on the off chance I liked them.  Otherwise, I thought, I could hold the second pair for one of my granddaughters.  No way; the second pair is mine

I am not the type of person that wears JEWELRY, but when I went shoping for a watch, because I needed one, one brand caught my eye...Fossil. Everyone knows Fossil, so, Everyone knows that they make good watches. I like this watch because of the color and because it has the day # on the face. It is like your everyday watch, but with that BLING look. VERY COOL and VERY JAMES BOND. If you know what I mean. I plan to wear this watch everywhere I go. You should get this one not only because it looks cool but because of the price. You know that $$$ makes up your mind for you

I'm very pleased with these earrings. They are a good weight...they aren't so heavy that they drag at the ear, but they are substantial and a perfect size. I'd recommend these to earring lovers

I had these on my wish list and decided to order them for myself after Christmas, after looking in stores and not finding anything that looked quite the same!  They just arrived and all I can say is WOW!  Nice look, substantial size and plenty of "statement".  Picture does not do them justice.  All I can say is don't hesitate, you will be dissappointed if they sell out

This is a great choice for a business casual style watch. With it's crystal clear face and smooth shape, it complements most business attire nicely. The adjustment button doesn't get pulled easily, so there is less chance of accidental time loss. After several weeks of wear, still no scratches on the watchface, and the metal remains untarnished. I still get questions about it. Definitely an eye-catcher

The watch itself looks preety elegant. However the bracelet is a bit too rigid and it cand be very unconfortable until you get used to it.

I don't regret buying it. It's worth the money

Got this watch for my one son for christmas, but ended up going to the other son,, since his arm is on the small size, and this is a pretty good size watch. IT is beautiful and well described. Arrived in perfect condition and had no problem requesting extra links using the fossil toll free # and then the local store that sells fossils put the links in for me. I went with a small dress watch for the other son.. everyone was happy

I am very impressed with the detail work on this ring. It is really eye catching and quite lovely.   The shipment arrived very quickly.  The stone is a true emerald shade of green and the cut is nice, but the clarity of the stone could be a little better. However, for the price,  it is an excellent ring and I would gladly give it as a gift

I was searching the web for weeks... I saw thousands of watches... and I didn't like them. When I saw THIS watch... that was IT - one of the most beautiful watches in the world.

I think design of this watch is superb - very simple, but astonishingly beautiful and original.

But there is one PROBLEM with this watch - it can be purchased only in North America. Being from Europe, I had difficulties to get it

I have thoroughly enjoyed these earrings.  Very nice size and great quality.  They are light-weight and have a great hinge.  I have a baby who sometimes grabs them, but they have yet to be bent out of shape.  I sometimes keep them in for days at a time and my sensitive ears don't ever develope a reaction

This will wow her but not worry her to think you are rushing anything 


Plus it's under 100. Can't beat the price. Thanks amazon

I really like them.  They look elegent on me.  One of the most favorite parts besides the looks, that I "especially" like is that they are the french loop kind that are easy and fast to put on and that they are heavy enough that they stay in place.  This reduces the risk of losing them.  But they are also light enough that I don"t feel bogged down with them on my ears.

Very good quality for the price.  They are simple, understated, and classic in design.  If you want flashy, however, these are not for you.  You can ignore the 1-star reviews--the 1-star rating goes to those who a) don't read the description before ordering, b) don't know what mm stands for, or c) don't have the visual-spatial skills to estimate the size of the earring in the picture by comparing the overall size to the earwire (which tends to be a fairly similar size on most earrings).  And please, if you can't tell 14k from $5.00 dimestore stuff that will likely turn your ears green, then your money is wasted here.  Go to Walmart and get yourself something big and cheap

These are delicate, classic gold hoops that go with anything. I like the fact that they are unadorned and simple and small enough to be understatated but large enough to give you an elegant look. The price can't be beat, either

The best dive watch money can buy, bar none.  For $150, you are getting a product that is unparalleled in quality and performance.  It's not perfect, and at around $150 it doesn't have to be, but what you are getting for that amount is far more what I can expect in Swiss Automatics 3x this price range or more.  And don't listen to the lone naysayer out there...I'm not sure what pipe they are smoking out of, but the luminosity of this watch is legendary among watch collectors....charge it up in light for a few seconds and watch this bad boy light up like Chernobyl.  I will echo a truth a fellow collector once related to me..."Any serious watch collector should have a Black Monster in their collection."

I have owned both the black "Monster" with bracelet ( my daily work watch )and the orange with the rubber strap ( which I sold to an envious friend ).
Besides all of the compliments that I have received from those who cant help but to notice the robust build of this model, it has also paid dividends in durability under rough service on the job. I have not been diving in many years however this is the watch that I would be most confident to wear at depth. As usual, Seiko does not disappoint

Great value for the price.  Better than expected in person.  Quality watch for the price.  Love this undersea face better than the other models out there.  Was happy to find out that even though the band is "kid sized", it also fits adult women's wrist.

Highly recommend.  Will probably buy one or 2 more

Although this watch (#MC0478) is labeled for kids, it is best geared for a girl 12-years or older. The timepiece portion appears to be better quality than the jelly strap, which looks very cheap. I purchased this as a gift for my 18-year old sister and went to a local jeweler to replaced the plastic band with a nice blue/green leather one. Overall my sister, who loves the Little Mermaid, is pleased with this watch. So far she hasn't reported any problems with the timepiece.

For the price, it's a good value for the timepiece, but I would recommend upgrading the band. The Little Mermaid face is the main reason I purchased this watch, but if you are looking for a good quality timepiece/band, you may consider another watch

This is the most beautiful bracelet.  The piece is awesome.  The sentiment is so true.  I love this bracelet and decided to keep it even though I'd bought it as a gift.  The workmanship is superb.  The bracelet arrived 2 days after I placed my order in a well packaged box; the bracelet was in a white box with a gold  ribbon around it

I bought two of these faux amber necklaces and they are quite well made. The pendant is almost 2 inches in length it does look larger in the photograph but by being smaller it looks more realistic. It is actually a good weight not to heavy not to light it looks as if some effort has been put into the making of it. I think it is a good purchase for the price because it does not look cheap or tacky

These lovely little gems are perfect for those women who, like me, have a second or third ear piercing. Small enough to be dainty but large enough to be seen without being unnecessarily ostentatious. 
These would make a great gift for a little girl as well.I particularly liked the price point where they were being offered as I suffer from a nickel allergy and always wear gold posts in my ear. Having recently transitioned from yellow to white gold these were lovely additions to my collection. At the price of under 10 dollars I was able to give them to a few others as a little hi there, how are you.

I bought these as a gift for my beautiful fiance for Christmas. At first she wasn't overly impressed, but when she put them on (to humour me) she found them very pretty, and unusual. The crystals really reflect the light, and she was extremely pleased with them

I bought two pairs, one as a gift for a sister-in-law and the other pair for myself (otherwise I would regret it!) Now my sister keeps complementing how beautuiful the earrings are- I bought another pair as a gift for her! The earrings are absolutely beautiful, the colors that reflect in the light are truly gorgeous. I recommend these for anyone that loves Swarovski crystal

because of not having saphire crystal

I'm a regular collector of diving watches and this is one of my favorite ones.  There is something about diving watches that is really attractive though it could be subconscious and because of the fact that you can get it wet and it would still work.  This watch feels rock solid like it just came out from a huge chunk of metal.  For such a quality feel, the price is super amazing.  I would have to go for my Submariner for a similar feel and on some days, I prefer the feel of this than of my Submariner!  The luminated markers are the brightest I ever seen on any watch, diving or non-diving.  Clasp is super-awesome, better than the Submariner.  Bracelet is not as nice looking but ok.  The moveable bezel has the best click of any of the diving watches I own and this is the least expensive dive watch of all but unfortunately I paid a little too much.  The only downside and may not be for you if you don't adjust your bands, but if you do, it's a chore.  I spend hours trying to do this and was only successful after improvising as the linking system is very unusual

From the moment you first hold this watch in your hand, you realize it is a quality timepiece. The first thing that strikes you is its large size and heavy feel, yet despite that, it feels comfortable on the wrist due to its fine balance. 

BRACELET: 
The bracelet end links (those that attach to the watch case) are solid rather than formed sheet metal like you will find on most other watches in this price range. The pins holding the bracelet to the watch are the sturdiest I have ever seen. Each of the bracelet's subsequent links is also made from a solid piece of steel, not folded sheet, each component being feather-edged to prevent it digging into the wrist. Its removable link pins are of an unusual machined pin and collar design which, though  fiddly to remove and replace, nevertheless ensure that the pins remain under-flush and secure when correctly installed. The bracelet is perfectly flush on the side that contacts your wrist making it feel very smooth during wear.
The clasp is very high quality, having both a fold over security buckle, which deploys with a satisfying click, and an Omega style double button catch. The security buckle closes onto a spring pin whose ends are spherical thus ensuring a tight fastening which should not wear with use. All in all these features add up to a watch that is very quiet on the wrist, the only faint sound coming from its automatic winding mechanism.
Finally the bracelet incorporates a clever hidden diver's extension (to allow the watch to be worn over a wet suit).

CASE:
The watch case, back and bezel are made from stainless steel. The case has an attractive mix of polished, brushed and machined finishes which all add to the feel of quality and function. The overall impression is that this is a precision instrument rather than a fashion piece; that's not to say though that it would look out of place with a dinner jacket any more than a wet suit.
The unidirectional bezel is of a heavily scalloped design, protected by bezel-guards which extend upwards from each of the lug pairs. The lower guard also functions as a crown guard and, all in all, the impression is of a case machined from a solid billet of  steel. The bezel sits slightly higher than the domed crystal, thus providing protection from scratching and the crystal itself is of a proprietary Seiko material "hardlex" which, as I understand it, is better at resisting scratches than mineral glass but less susceptible to shattering than sapphire.
The luminosity of this watch is astounding due partly to the use of Seiko's proprietary "lumibrite" paint but also to the large coated areas on the hour markers and hands.
The bezel only turns one way, as a safety feature for timing dives, and feels silky smooth, the best I've experienced on any Seiko or Invicta diver. It has 120 clicks per revolution and is nicely aligned with the face.

MOVEMENT:
The watch uses the 21 jewel Seiko 7S26 movement running at 21,600 bph (that's 6 ticks per second).  It is non-hacking which means that the second hand does not stop when the crown is pulled out. Although this makes it difficult to synchronize,  if a slight backward pressure is applied to the fully extended crown, it is possible to stop the second hand. The watch can not be hand wound but the self winding mechanism is very efficient and I have found that it has a power reserve of at least 24 hours. The 7S26 has been around for many years and has a reputation for ruggedness and reliability.

ACCURACY:
There are several reviews where people complain of poor accuracy. Typically, when new, automatic movements will be set to run fast at the factory because they tend to slow down after a few weeks of use. I own three watches with the 7S26 movement and after their breaking in period all are now keeping time to within 10 seconds per day.
I have a few thoughts on accuracy. You have to ask yourself how accurate does your watch need to be? If it is running 10 or 20 seconds fast per day then set it one minute slow and you will only need to re-set it once every week or two when it has advanced to one minute fast. If you need more accuracy then, unless you are willing to pay at least five times as much for a swiss watch, then buy a quartz. 

Finally, if you do a search on the Seiko Monster you'll quickly come to realize that in its various colours, these watches are firm favourites amongst those who frequent the many watch forums. I would highly recommend that you purchase one and see for yourself!

I've had a lot of watches in my life.  Some dressy, some functional, and some practically indestructible.  This watch is a combination of all these factors.  Very solid feeling (and much heavier than my titanium dive watch).  Looks great and functions well.  I also like the wetsuit link which allows a quick adjustment to fit over your wetsuit.  The orange face is very legible, and at night, the watch glows almost bright enough to read by!  The clasp is very secure, with a dual button release and an extra clasp to prevent accidental opening.  Day & date are easy to adjust and very readable (much better than my Citizen).  This is a solid performing watch and worth the  money

The watch looks great; prominent, yet not overly large.  The orange really sets off the look.  The large luminescent indexes are easy to see long after dark.  I also like having both day and date complications, and to find an automatic watch with these features for less than $300 (way less on Amazon) is really a find.  You will need a pro to adjust the bracelet, though, as each link pin is held in by two tiny bushings that are impossible to replace without the proper jeweler's tools.  Another bother is that the watch gains over a minute a day.  Overall, I really like it.  It's become my daily wear watch.

I was a little worried that the bracelet would be too large for a 5 year old, but I got this for my daughter's birthday and it fits her perfectly.  I was also a little concerned that it might be cheap looking like other things I've bought from Amazon lately, but it's actually a very cute, well-made, cheap bracelet

Good looking, stylish, smart and clean design, "handsome".
Once I was specifically looking for "animated" watches. This was one of the results. Although, given Amazon description is really lacking details. I bought it and didn't really know what are the features in general and also specifically concerning the animation. So, now I know. It has a button aside that is switching between two animation schemes. One: seconds numeric value rotates clockwise on the display; two: seconds drop down in two halfs on the display. Thats all for animation and features in general. No light, no more animations, no stoppers/timers, nothing else; just plain watch.
For me, the good looks somewhat compensates the "thing" I was originally looking for

I have had this winder for about a month now and I am very happy with it. The major convenience is the well-engineered slots and iserts holding watches that are of a very good quality. The inserts are holding watches steadily which contributes to proper winding. All previous more expensive winders with cushion type inserts were falling out (with watches!)and eventually were rendered useless. Highly recommended unit

I have seen many other winders in the market with the same features but with much higher prices.  This winder is so quiet that I have no problem sleeping even with it on.  I highly recommend it

Once I got the hang of it it worked like a charm. I needed to mount a magnifying glass to the table so I could see for perfect alignment. If not perfectly aligned you break pins.  Now that I got the hang of it I have one pin left I keep e-maling seller to buy more pins but seller won't answer. Does anyone know where to get more pins? I would buy another unit but seller went to the bank on shipping charges

I have several Fossil watches, and every time I needed to adjust the band, it cost me around $10 - $15. I found this tool and figured it was worth a try. I was able to remove links from 2 of my Fossil watches, though my newest Fossil watch band was too wide to easily fit in the tool. 
 I even used it to adjust watches for 2 of my friends.It worked well, made the adjustments and they were very happy with it! they plan to buy it for themselves!
 you do have to make sure the pin lines up correctly with the pin, but beyond that, it works like a dream

wind the pin in ever so slowly and watch if you aren't going into the hole. the smallest inaccuracy can cause the pin to bend. I straighted mine out and go the pin hole next try and it worked a dream.
Also good lighting is a must

I was expecting this watch to be a little more chunky than it is.  It is a little smaller than I pictured, but it is a nice, non flashy watch.  I haven't received any compliments on it after wearing it for a few weeks, so if you are looking for a subtle, but cute watch, this is for you.  BUt if you want a watch that makes a statment and that people will notice, I'd look elsewhere

I ordered my unit directly from Jewel Jet. Aside from receiving the unit in a box that was severely damaged as it was drop shipped in its own box,  I have no complaints with it working as advertised. The unit is quite large so you may not want to leave on the counter but the results are SPECTACULAR. It definitely out cleans my Sonic Cleaner.  I have not been able to see a difference between this and the results after I get my jewelry steamed at a large retailer like Fortunoff. I first used it on a G Color VS stones, but it has caused me to start pulling out pieces of lesser quality that I have not worn in ages to give them a revitalizing breath of "fresh steam" and I still label the results as SPECTACULAR. I love that I am achieivng these great results with just adding tap water. With my own experimenting, I honestly couldn't tell a difference when using after precleaning pieces in a detergent solution as a competing model - that uses BOTH detergent and distilled water - claims

I purchased this version of the Ironman Triathlon 30-Lap for my two pre-teen boys.  They love it!  Very durable...easy to use...lightweight.  Can't beat the value either.

I own the larger men's version of this watch.  I'm on my second one though.  The first one lasted about a year before it developed condensation under the glass, then stopped working.  I surf 3-4 times per week and I wasn't rinsing the watch well with fresh water.  I'm guessing that the salt deposits compromised the seal on the watch.

I've had my second one for over a year now and it's like new!  I highly recommend this watch if you're very active and want a good lightweight watch that's waterproof

I have owned several Ironman over the last 30 years or so and I have been pleased.  However, my last Timex watch had a twist of the dial control function and was a great disappointment as the dial became difficult to twist and finally the watch stopped working after only six months.  I was very disappointed in Timex and almost didn't buy this one.  This watch is the traditional men's Ironman, but smaller than I had purchased before and it fits nicely on my large wrist with plenty of band length. I have owned the new watch for three months with fairly rugged use and it functions great with easy to operate controls and it is very readable.  My wife and adult children tell me that it looks like a women's watch but I think they are used to oversized wathes that have been in style and I assure them that I am on the cutting edge of a new trend towards smaller (and more reasonally sized) wrist watches for men.  I am happy to say, that once again, I am very pleased with Timex.

These earrings are a good size but still very light.  It is a little tricky to learn how to fasten them, but once hooked they stay safely closed all day.  The clasp sytem does not show once the earrings are on - so this is a very clean and classic look.  I have long hair and the clasp does not tangle in my hair

This is a very nice piece... I've been looking for a key pendant for a while now... But all the ones I've seen have been very feminine.  And this one, while slightly satanic... Fits nicely to the meaning I wanted, without making me feel like a fairy princess.  

Shipping even got here early...!

My only problem with it is having to pull out the pliers to get it to fit on a different neck piece from the same seller.  4/5

Silver Insanity has the best accessories!!! I saw the image of the ring on Amazon and immediately fell in love. I love rings that covers your proximal phalanx (the bone in your finger closest to your hand). When I received the ring, (earlier than counted upon), I was a little disappointed to see how little it looked and how dainty but that was before I tried it on. I was expecting the ring to be bulky and glad it wasn't. The fingers surrounding it wasn't bothered or irritated thx to the rings slimness. I recommend using the ring size chart b/c I had thought I'd be a 6; turns out, I'm a 7. What was misleading, though, is the picture. The leaves are shown bright, but it looks noticably darker (inside the outer rimming of the leaf, to where the gems are) when you have it in your hands. My fingers are long and slender. The ring didn't twist or turn about, but it didn't cover my proximal phalanx completely. I'll measure... from the end of the bottom leave to the end of the top, it's about 3.3cm. My middle proximal phalanx (the bone in your middle finger closest to your hand) is about 3.8cm. And if you should run your fingers through your hair, the leaves will not get entangled! Nice!
You can wear the damn ring everywhere!!! I love it

As other reviewers have stated - this watch is large and it's heavy. I think it would look best on a larger person with big wrists or arms.  The night light is cool and effective.

Classy look and very durable. Very nice watch for the price. I bought mine at a discount store and paid about $6 more for it. I like it, despite its 10mm thickness. Not that heavy if you're like me, 6'2" and 250lbs. It's a man's watch, practical yet with some style while not being trendy. I haven't had any problems with it so far, despite having dropped it twice and worn it outside while working and getting it soaked with sweat multiple times. I don't find it uncomfortable at all and I forget I am wearing it. (I suggest taking it off, the leather band doesn't clean easily like a metal band.) I'm considering buying a second one and keeping it cleaner this time. (Lesson learned.

I wanted a basic watch that would be for everyday use and liked this Timex design.  I was very pleased that it looked even nicer in person...clear face, leather band with slightly heavier stitching than some, good weight (not too heavy).  I have received a few compliments at work/co-workers were surprised at the value for the cost.  Overall, a solid Timex offering that you will enjoy if you're drawn to the style/image that appears here in the product details

I ordered (not from Amazon) a black titanium watch with a black face and white hands (model 530LTMLB, for those of you scoring at home). After an apologetic out-of-stock phone call from the dealer, I settled on what I thought was going to be the same watch but with a white face and black hands (model 530LTMLW, for you precise types). 

What I got instead was this watch. In the photograph, it looks like dark gray matte metal with a white face. It's not: It's eggshell light gray metal with a mother-of-pearlish face.

I hadn't worn a watch in five years: after all, who needs one in the cell-phone age? (Definitive answer: anyone driving across country with a Sprint cellphone). I took my sweet time selecting a new watch, and got something completely different from what I ordered. I could easily have returned it. Before I did, I slipped in on my wrist to see what it felt like, and promptly forgot that it was there.

(To the nice lady who answered my request for the time with a drop-dead-you're-wearing-a-watch response, can I say that it wasn't actually a pickup line?)

The titanium thing is not a gimmick: this watch is (obviously) very light indeed, and solid. I have hopes that the light gray colour is undoctored titanium alloy, in which case it will still look good after life deals it some hard knocks. 

I set it to the exact (down to the second) correct time when I got it a month ago. It either has a very good movement, or it's secretly communicating with that atomic clock in Colorado without my knowledge.

Some reviewers have complained about a poor latch: I respectfully suggest they don't know how to close it. The watch has a very secure double-latch, which is poorly-explained but is not rocket science - I've added the instructions at the end.

Some complain about noise: this might be a quality-control issue. I can't comment to it because my watch is as quiet as the heartbeat of a fetus.
(Update several weeks later: The watch is slowly becoming louder, but the loudness changes irregularly, even when the watch is sitting by my bed. It is still very quiet, but but the fact that it is changing does not speak well to long-term durability.)

It gets 4 stars because I can't tell the time with my glasses off, which is why I wanted a high-contrast watch in the first place. But they're not getting this one back.

LATCH INSTRUCTIONS:
To get us properly oriented, lay the watch flat, with the face up. On one end of the strap is the half of the clasp that also contains the strap length adjustment. Open up the clasp part. Next to the strap length adjustment mechanism you will see a plain bar. Now look at the other end of the strap: on the very end of it is a solid, curved clasp. Swing it open, and you will see a wide double hook. 

Put the watch on your wrist, and attach the double hook to the plain bar. Next, close the solid clasp until it clicks. Next, close the other clasp over the first one, also until it clicks.

It is provably impossible for any single brush up against an object (say, an outboard motor) to loosen it

I've had this watch for about nine months now. I wear it every day. It keeps great time and looks great as well. Many people have complimented me on the design of this watch and asked me who made it. The mesh band is the most comfortable and lightest band you will ever wear.

I saw these Skagen watches in a local clock store, and fell in love with the titanium model. It is extremely light and comfortable. I was a little concerned about quality because it was so inexpensive for titanium. Though the movement is made in Japan, the rest of the watch is assembled somewhere else, I would assume Hong Kong. The word "Denmark" on the face is strictly for style, no part of the watches are made there. Regardless, it seems to be very well made; I've had mine for a year now, and it keeps excellent time and runs reliably. I bought a different Skagen model for my wife at the same time, and hers is just as well made. It has been a great watch and I heartily recommend it.

EDIT: I have been taking swimming lessons, and wearing this watch during them. It has not leaked a drop. I was told it was not suitable for any real depth, such as those encountered while snorkeling or scuba diving, but every other underwater test I've given it, it has passed.

The pliers do the job & seem to be well made. My only problem was the awkwardness in trying to align the link. I guess if you remove the band from the watch, it would make it easier. In that case I recommend one of the pin removers that sit flat on a horizontal surface. BUT...this did do the job (even leaving the band on the watch). It comes with a smaller sized push pin that is a breeze to swap out

I never adjusted a watch band before and I thought it was going to be difficult after reading the other reviews on the other watch tools. This tool could not have made it any easier, I didn't break any pins and I adjusted two watch bands the night it arrived with ease. You will need a pair of needle nose pliers to pull the watch pin completely out of the band. I adjusted an Accutron Lady's York and a Swiss Army Men's Maverick. I used the tool to remove and replace the watch pins, just line the pins and squeeze the pliers slowly. The accutron used solid pins and the Swiss Army used pins that looked like they were screws but were pins that are cut or bent in half so always push from the end that looks like a screw head

I first purchased this watch in 1994 when I entered the selection coarse to be an Air Force CCT.  I lost the watch years later but I would occasionally try to find a replacement with no luck.  I now work for US DOJ and will be deployed to Baghdad for a while and I need a watch I will be able to absolutely depend on in extreme conditions.  This is the only watch I will ever own.  I cannot say enough about it.  Maybe I'm sentimental but I love this watch

I bought my first Casio Diver's watch with the gold face years ago.  I wore the heck out of it, and eventually, the band broke.  I must have hunted for a replacement band or a whole new watch but to no avail.  A long-time friend then just sat in a drawer.  Recently, I found these watches were still available so I got a new one.  I even found a replacement band (made by Timex) for my original watch.  I must say I once again feel whole again.  This watch has timeless styling and wonderful functionality in a very reasonable priced watch.  I'm thinking about getting the black and the white ones so I can switch it up from time to time

This watch was great. I really loved the digital feature residing in the analog face. 
I don't know about others out there but analog watches are the only way to go. I love the fact that I can visually see what time it is in a graphical representation, but I love having the digital features such as the alarm, timer, stopwatch, and date feature.
I wore the watch 24/7 and it never ever gave me a problem, however, when I was filming an independent film within a west texas silo I lost the watch climbing the ladder out. I was climbing a straight vertical steel pipe ladder and as I reached the top hatch, which lead to the top landing, my watch face caught on the side of the steel ladder and the band pins broke. Next thing I knew I heard a "plop" and new my wonderful watch was on its way to the bottom of a 120 foot watery depth!!
I will probably get another one but I really would love one with a metal band

Overall the watch is awesome.  I do actually use it when diving, though it is only rated as water "resistant" and not waterproof.  I can say it holds up to at least 90 feet.  The dial is very readable at depth, the digital display however is not.  The multifunction display has no backlight and at times can be hard to make out, even on land.  The display does have luminescent hands and numbers that can be make out with no problem.  Very comfortable and functional

I first got one of these when it was issued to me in the Air Force back in the early 1990's.  As a fighter pilot (former) I've busted more watches in cockpits than most but this one held up.  Now that I'm in the more sedate confines of an airline cockpit, I still wear it.  It has dual time zones and an alarm, perfect for international travel.  Beware, it's a BIG watch!  If that's not your style, you may want to see one in person before you buy.  The only drawback... the plastic/rubber band will crack after 2+ years and need replacement.  I put a nice leather band on mine and even had a passenger compliment me on my "Breitling".  When I told him it was a Casio and cost $4950 less, he wanted one too.

After nearly two months my two automatic watches are ticking happily away. The mechanism is very quiet and the winder looks tidy.
The only critisism I have is lack of instructions to mount the watches. Maybe all winders work the same way but this was my first experience with wone and it took a while to work out the watch mounts are spring loaded to accept teh watch band. Once I sorted that out - no problem

The product, as i recalled, cost about $36 for a double winder.  The product works quite well and is reasonably quiet.  If one reads one of the watch magazines on the market one will quickly find out there are many watch winders out there and most cost a lot of money--in the hundreds to thousands of dollars. This product is in the tens of dollars and works very well.  I am very happy with the product--as well as Amazon (dot) com.

I recently received the item and I love it. It is whisper quiet, works in both directions, and is automatic. I have seen other winders at 5x this price that don't do the same. Any of the winder would be a waste of money unless they sell a single winde

Recommended for those automatic watch lovers, you can buy 4 of these for the price of an others model

I needed to replace another Timex Ironman 100 lap watch I had purchased a few years back (the rubber frame that holds the strap broke).  Really liked this watch because of the large readout, ease of use, lap calculation.  I'm a Marathoner and novice Triathlete, so a good, simple, versatile watch is an important piece of equipment for me.  After looking for over a month, I decided to purchase the Timex Triathlon 100 Lap Flix System Watch, and I'm glad I did.  Great readout, easy button control (start and split are much more pronounced - great improvement) and a very sturdy velcro strap makes this a winner for me.  I've already used the timer function with alarm for my swim and bike intervals, and of course the chrono function with splits is easy to read and use.  This is a great watch!

This is the second pair of earrings I got from Silver Insanity, and I can tell you you won't be dissapointed.  They may be synthetic, but no one will ever guess while you're wearing them!  They catch the light beautifully, and the delicate silver design compliments the gems perfectly.  I always get compliments when I wear these.  And you can't beat the price

My son tells me that he loves his watch and would give it 500 out of 5 stars.  He saved up for it, and he bought it with his own money after his ADHD and Asperger's self had trouble walking home from the library one too many times when it was time (and after more than a few reminders).  He'd also missed cello lessons at school and was very frustrated with himself for the difficulties he was having.  It is a cool watch.  It looks good, it has two alarms (cello lesson and whatever else he needs) a stop watch and a countdown timer--that he's found a use for so far.  It is waterproof/or resistant, so that means when he forgets to take it off before his bath it's ok.  This watch was a way that he could solve his own problems, and reorganize his own life to make up for some of his difficulties.  That's why I like it so much.

It has all these features and looks really cool and it doesn't cost an arm and a leg.  That's the best, I think. I'm not sure if he'll ever need the lap timer or the pacing feature or anything like that.  I suppose those features are awesome for those who use them, but for our purposes and our budget, this watch is perfect

This is a must have watch for serious runners.  I have had mine for over a month and I love mine.  I am a professional track and field athlete, and I train very hard to win races.  This watch helps me train better than any other watch I've ever had.  It gives you up to 50 lap splits which are great for any workout that is over 800 meters on a track.  Not only that but it has 5 interval timers, which you can set your appropriate rest time on.
   If you are a serious runner like myself, I highly suggest you get this watch.  It is definately something that you will need

I have longed for gold hoop earrings for years.  These seemed liked they were the ones!  But I waited a while, still debating..... finally 'went for it' and got a pair. I haven't regretted it at all.  I find these earrings comfortable, and I like the way they look on me.  I am very happy with these and recommend these beauties!..... Now, if they would make them in white gold..........

Zina makes wonderful jewelry and that is why I am frustrated that they use such a cheap chain for this pendant. The pendant itself is beautiful and the silver SHINES, but the garnet is very small.  It is a nice red color though. I purchased this on sale and that is why it gets four stars and not three.

If you want a subtle piece of jewelry that will get attention, this is it! I have gotten more compliments and questions from strangers when I wear these (earrings and pendant) than I have from all the Swarovski jewelry I have created and worn.  This is a very different color than I have ever worked with; it appears as if two sides only are 2x AB and the other two aren't - quite unusual which makes it fun

This watch is you would expect from any Timex watch.  It's easy to read the face while running, easy to set, big button on the front for the light so no fumbing when wearing gloves for the little side button on some.  It's lightweight if a bit stiff to start with, but eventually easied a bit with age.  I only use it for running timing, not my everyday watch, but I'll buy one again when I lose this one (as I usually lose them long before they wear out).  I haven't had it long enough to notice any real wear in the band yet, not sure if it'll wear out easier or not, but so far, so good (1 year)

Great features on this watch.  I especially like the linked timers and the three alarms.  My wrist is tiny, and the selection of holes is great (I use the tightest).  This does leave a gap because the band is still bigger than my wrist, and the extra band wraps all the way around, but it doesn't slip and it feels very comfortable.  The alarm sound is pleasant.  The color is great too

Its tough to beat the price of these 1/2 ct. diamonds for $199; they looked really good and the wife loved them.  The only reason I gave 4 stars is because they only have non-screw backs and they didn't come with a diamond spec sheet to verify what you got.  But for the price, a minor quibble... you won't be disappointed with your purchase

These are beautiful.  At a total .50 carat for the pair, each .25 carat stud is well matched for color and clarity.  If you like white gold and diamonds, you won't be disappointed.

This is my third Skagen watch.  The design is ultra thin and the titanium consturction makes it ultra light. The design is sophisticated enough for dress and sleek enough for sports wear. They have proven to be reliable timekeepers and I liked this one so much I bought two more for my sons. At less than $80.00 each they are a real bargin

I've had two Skagen Watches and have to say they are my favorite. I love the large face and the Titanium bracelet (you don't have to remove the watch in order to shower!). A lot of people have complimented me on the watch, too. Given the price and quality, you can't go wrong. If you ever need a part replaced, you just send it to Skagen; the work is completed in a couple of weeks! In summary: an elegant watch at a reasonable price

I read the reviews about people saying their watch scratched and lost paint on it.  Mine has not done this with the exception of the clasp.  Since the watch and band are titanium it should be anondized, meaning it's not going to come off.  However the clasp and a few other small parts (watch hands) are made of stainless steel, so they will start losing their finish after awhile.

After wearing this watch for a few weeks, I went and put on my old stainless steel Citizen watch.  It felt huge and felt like it weighed a ton.  I went and weighed each of them.  The Citizen came in around 4.5oz, while the Skagen came in at around 1.5oz.  It is also very thin, I used to not be able to wear a watch since typing on a computer all day the band would irritate me, have not had any problems with the Skagen.

One other thing to note, the picture for this item shows the Steel watch (you can see it on the face), if you want to see a picture of the titanium one, take the product number and go to skagen's site, or google.

The skagen lost a star because of the paint coming off the clasp (not the band)

My roommate got this for his girlfriend, and after examining his girlfriend's ears, I have decided that these earrings are great for the price. Not something you want to give your wife, but an excellent gift for a young boyfriend trying to impress his young (or old) girlfriend with an entry-level "nice" gift. They are a decent size, and no faults are noticeable at a normal distance. Recommended

I am extremely impressed with the feel, look and general quality of the watch.  It contains the Citizen Miyota 21 jewel automatic movement that is a true workhorse for a fraction of the price.  The comfortable stainess steel pinned link bracelet is worth the price of the watch. It has rounded flexible brushed steel wrist links The foldover adjustable double safety clasp uses pins as well. Can easily be mistaken for a watch costing much more.  The Mineral Glass crystal is scratch resistant - but not as good as a sapphire watch face, but is less prone to chipping or shattering than a sapphire crystal. The display watchback is also mineral glass - displaying the undecorated Miyota automatic movement. It look as stylish and run as well as my other watches, and, I receive as many comments if not more from the Invicta's.  It is a great looking watch!  Good value, accurate and stylish if you like the Sub' look. This is a good day-to-day knock about watch that still looks better than the quartz stuff in the same price band. If it lasts 5 years it's more than paid for itself

I bought one as a gift. It looks great on him. But it ran out of battery after half a year, and my friend need get it fixed. This should not happend for a new watch. As the watch was already started when I received it, there was a possibility that it wasn't brand new when I bought them. Other than that, it is a good buy

Because I teach, I wear a man's watch so I can keep my eye on the clock without seeming to look at my watch all the time.  This beauty has a very easy to read dial.  And it looks very cool and retro--I've gotten many compliments.  I should probably have the bracelet made smaller--it's one of the bigger-sized men's watches I've ever worn--so I think it would be a great choice for big guys.  I am quite pleased with my purchase.  The price was nice, too

This watch is generally a good watch, but there are some flaws in ours--not a surprise considering the price.  One, there is a white haze under the crystal when viewed in the sunlight--perhaps the result of careless manufacturing and cleaning.  Two, my son has had the band come apart twice in one month.  The later probably a design issue relative to all the spring-loaded retainers and such, and the general range of movement of the clasp

This watch looks like business.  The movement is what I really like.  You get about 5 ticks per second instead of 1 so it looks more sweeping (though I wouldn't call it sweeping).  I give it a 5 based on looks and cost.  I haven't had it long, and it took a couple days of wearing it for it to keep time correctly (it was losing a few hours at night).  I guess it just needed to get charged up.  It's no Rolex, but it's no Casio either.

This watch looks and feels great on me. Yes, I had to take out about 6 links to get a good fit, but that was fairly easy and only took 5 minutes (which included figuring out how to do it, which I'll explain at the end).

The clasp locks well - firm, but not difficult to lock/unlock, and is very secure. I was a little suprised with how lightweight the links/band is. That's the only part of the watch that feels a little cheap. Don't get me wrong, it's well constructed, but it's not like a Big Manly Steel Band. At the end of the day, I found that I loved it because it ISN'T heavy.

I didn't give it a full 5 stars because after having it a few weeks there's a teeny tiny scratch that developed on the face/crystal. I'm really cautious and have been gentle with it, so I'm rather disappointed this happened. (And it very possibly might have been me knocking up against a brick wall or something). If you're especially rough on your things, this might not be the best watch for you.

Taking the links out is EASY if you're not completely inept. You'll want something small and sort-of pointy (I happened to have had a filed-down mini screwdriver, but a nail would probably work just as well). I found it easiest to first disconnect the standard clasp - just push the pin in (on either side) and wiggle the clasp apart. Make sure you don't drop/lose the pin. 

For the links, it's fool-proof - it has an arrow engraved on the back of the links, showing you which side the pin/insert comes out. Stick the nail/whatever into the small oval hole and pry the pin out the side. Pull it out with a pair of pliers (it's in there pretty tight) and you can then remove the link

The watch arrived in great condition, it is a very stylish and affordable watch, the only thing is that it is a tad too big and my boyfriends had to take some links out.  He has a big wrist so it was a little unusual.  Nice watch though! No regrets

this ring is just about what i expected.  it's fun and puzzling, and it looks nice.  i figured it out after about 20 minutes of messing with it(i've always been good with puzzles, so it might take someone else longer)

This ring is absolutely gorgeous and I havent taken it off since recieving it. But when buying this ring, be careful not to take the string off of the bands. This string protects you from well....insanity. I unfortunately took off the string and my ring separated into the 4 separate bands. Luckily I found a website that gave me instructions on how to reassemble it. My dad put it back together and it was fine, but I have to admit I'm a little distraut about how there is no indication or warning telling people not to take it off. If this does happen to you, google "puzzle ring solutions" and there are many websites to guide you in restoring your ring to normal.

I love this ring! It's interesting to look at, and I like the design. I haven't taken the string off for fear of not being able to figure out the puzzle. Maybe one day I might try it, but I like it so much I don't want to chance it now. Shipped fast

I loved the Wiccan Protection knot pendant, I purchased it for my daughter for Christmas and she hasn't taked it off since.  She had wanted a Celtic tricetta necklace, but absolutely adored this one just as much.  
Thank you

I was very pleased when I recieved this...I love that it doesn't look like every single other pendant on the market and although it looks like it in the picture, it's not enormously huge.  Just the right size and very pretty

I have been looking for a bracelet for what seems to be years. Never found the right style/size/design combination to fit until now. This bracelet looks great on the wrist. It is well constructed and very comfortable to wear with no pinching; I'm giving it the full 5 stars without any hesitation

This bracelet looks better than the picture.  It looks beautiful on my wrist. The fifty bucks that I paid for it was a real bargain. I love it. There's only one drawback, it's 8 inches long and that's too long for my wrist. If it fit perfectly, I'd give it ten stars. I'll pay to make it smaller. It's made of titanium, and maybe it's too tough to alter. I want it to fit over that knot on my wrist. If I can get it altered, I'll wear it until the day I die, which I hope will be 100 years from now

I got this bracelet for my boyfriend. Initially, I was looking at two different designs, but I'm really interested with this one. I made up my mind to buy this bracelet. When I received it, I'm vary satisfied with it. It's really nice, and the good thing is my boyfriend really like it. It's a worth buy.

As a gift, this bracelet will not disappoint.  It appears just (or better) as it does in the picture.  The only downside is that, for a gentlemen with a thicker bone structure, there will not be any give, nor do they provide extra links to make it a bit more comfortable.  Otherwise, one cannot go wrong with selecting it

Beautiful Watch!! I was already familiar with Invicta and know that they're worth three times the price and that in the future they will be.  Had it in just a few days.  Don't let the picture fool you.  It does not do this piece justice and you would be better off going to another site to view what this watch actually looks like...looks like it cost a whole lot more.  I've been watching Invicta's for about a year now and if you find a better price than this...It's stolen!!!

This color was on a price special and I liked the look in the picture so I chose this model.  I found that the silver on silver makes it a bit more difficult to read than I would have liked but it's adequate.  Good, accurate movement as the other Invicta timepieces I've owned or known of have also been.  This one is quite heavy and has a feel of a more pricey timepiece.  Mine is running about 3 seconds slow per week which doesn't seem bad but former Invictas I've had were a bit better than this.

Update to prior review....  Now that the watch has limbered up, the accuracy has improved and I've hardly needed to touch it

I had one exactly like this one for over 20 years, but finally the crown fell off.  I am keeping it for a backup as it is still running just fine.
I expect the same quality of my new Seiko.  I highly recommend this model.  Easy to read dial (especially the white face) and also a fine looking piece of jewelry

Extremely reliable, easy to read, looks like the Rolex style, only it is very lightweight. Good for everyday use because you can wear either gold or silver jewelry with this watch. I would have given it 5 stars if it were one of those models which does not need a battery

This item was very nice.  The chain was longer than I expected and hangs really low on my neck, but it only looks like the real one.  You can tell that it is a knock off, but you get what you pay for.  For $5 I think that it was worth it, but it does look different than the "real" one.  Good service and delivery

This invicta is a really nice watch but with some problems: All metal surfaces are polished on this watch so they scratch very easily and quickly. And the clock face is a bit too shiny in my opinion (hard to read in direct light).
Also, who needs a 24h dial on a chronograph (instead of a 1/10s dial)?

But overall for this price a good deal and good looking

The bracelets were as advertised, shipping was reasonably prompt.
The only thing that I am slightly worried about is whether the elastic band which holds the pearls is strong enough to last for some time. These were not intended for me, I bought them as a gift for my mother and I can only comment on its longevity only after she's used them for some time

Obviously the pearls are flawed, but because of their size you can't tell even from a short distance away.

They're super cute, but I suggest getting them 2 or 3 at a time as they look a bit awkward on their own

I ordered one each for my 5-year-old daughter and her 2 friends for Valentine's Day.  Nice pearl color and oval-like shapes.  Slightly too big for a 5-year-old but would be good for older children or a small wristed adult. Very dainty.  A great buy for the price

I haven't worn pierced earrings in years;I thought they were sealed. When I discovered that they were indeed open, I sought some simple gold post types to wear. When I saw my March birthstone set in a simple gold setting, I couldn't resist it. The actual earring is so elegant! 'Tis exactly as described, and more! Wearing such graceful simplicity in my beauty-starved lobes makes me feel like royalty! And for such a small price with the security of Amazon!
What a joy! 
Sincerely,

These earrings are so exceptionally shiny and cute.  The are a nice size and look very well made. A couple of small drawbacks:  The pointy edges of the sunshine's rays are kind of sharp and also, the hook part seems to be extra thin because a normal small rubber back does not fit and will slide right off but if you wear the earrings without a rubber back, they will slide out and you will lose them (I know this because I had to backtrack in the grocery store only to find my missing earring in the produce section!).  They DO provide a rubber back that fits but it is so very very tiny that I could easily lose it and it's hard to handle with fingernails.  BUT don't let those things stop you from buying these earrings because they are so distinctive and attractive.  I always get lots of compliments when I wear them

This watch is definitely something that I will keep with me for a while.  It is simple, elegant, and came to me for relatively cheap.  The free shipping is always a bonus, and I also came across it in the Gold Box deals, and when I saw it I knew I had to have it.  It is pink and is lighter pink in the center.  The bracelet was large with the extra links, so I removed them and took it to the store to make it smaller. I think its a great watch for both casual and more formal settings

As soon as he shook it, the watch did exactly what it was suppose to and set itself to the right time, date, and month. He's absolutely thrilled with it. And I was thrilled with the price from this company. Thanks all around

My wife commented to me on the attractiveness of this watch, something she has never done before as she doesn't own a watch, and has no interest in them. It is a beautiful timepiece.

What can you really say other than what is listed in the specifications. It works just fine, and keeps perfect time.

So, what is my small criticism? There is a lot of gold and white coloring on the face of the watch, and there is a lot of gold and white on the hands. The problem is that at certain times it is somewhat difficult to distinguish the hands from the background. If you have perfect eyesight this might not be a problem. My eyes are decidedly not perfect. Gone are the days when I can surreptitiously glance at my watch while listening to some boring conversationalist. I generally have to bring the watch to about a foot from my face to read the hands.

Still it is a great watch, and I feel compelled to give it a full five stars

I have enjoyed the oregon series watch.  It is good looking.  The band is comfortable and is holding up nicely.  The display is easy to read, and the light is quite good.  My one complaint is that the chronograph is often difficult to clear.  I run a good bit, and I was doing a workout the other day.  I had to keep holding down the clear button to get the old time off.  Other than that, I have enjoyed the watch immensely.  I thought the price was extremely reasonable as well

it's got an alarm, stop watch, timer, lap timer, 5 alarms actually, a water break alarm, water resistant, although don't go aggressive swimming with it because water leaked inside mine, and when it gets hot outside, water vapor rises to the glass dial and it blurs out the time...but other than that, it's a great watch, finest i've owned in terms of digital watch, i highly recommend it

I bought this watch for my son, a Marine, serving in Iraq, because he requested a sturdy digital with an alarm. This one had a large face which he says is extremely easy to read in any light, especially at night.
It is comfortable, and sits close to the wrist with very little profile.
He loves it, and asked me to order a second one because he wants a back-up!

Atomic watches are highly-accurate quartz watches which are synchronized each day with a time signal broadcast in the U.S. from the definitive U.S. Atomic Clock in Ft. Collins, Colorado. Thus, all atomic watches are always accurate to within a fraction of a second at any time. Since atomic watches adjust automaticaly to and from daylight saving time they are convenient as well as highly accurate. Casio makes -- and Amazon sells -- a wide selection of styles of atomic watches to suit various needs and tastes, including G-Shock watches for extra ruggedness and solar-powered watches which never need replacement batteries. But all atomic watches, including this budget-priced Waveceptor model, are equally accurate to a fraction of a second at all times. If you want a numbered-face watch that is always accurate this model is a real bargain

I like this watch as it was pretty cheap and it keeps good time, right with WWV time clock for the last couple of months since I got it. I am extremely hard on watches. The crystal is not hard so it is scratched already. The time is very accurate with the Colorado WWV time station. For 30 bucks or so, except for the scratched face is the only issue. Worth the mone

I wanted an inexpensive watch which keeps accurate time. This fills the bill quite nicely. It sets itself daily and even uses WWV's "leap year" flag so you don't have to worry about the Daylight Savings time change.

It is a bit fussy here in Pittsburgh (hill country). It took a bit of experimentation to find some place to sit it overnight where it will get a good signal. It instructs in the manual to sit it near a window with the "six" on the watch pointed at the window and to let it sit for up to 10 minutes.

I followed the manual instructions several times. Then I picked up the watch right after I initiated the manual search for the signal. I moved it around until it showed a steady "3" (highest signal level). Problem solved.

Adjusting the band should be as simple as looking for the arrows and pusing out the pin, etc. Except it require brute force. I broke a jeweler's screwdriver and small punch in the process.

I should have bought an expansion band at the same time

This was a pleasant surprise for the money and the craftsmanship is quite good. Only criticism is the adjustment of the band is a bit tedious. It is certainly worth while and a durable product. I would certainly buy this product again

Actually, it's a fabulous watch.  It looks great, does everything that you would expect, and is a joy to look at - I've swapped it for a watch that my wife bought me for a wedding present "just to get used to it for a bit" (which obviously she's less than pleased about), and everytime I look at it I see a really great watch that I'm really pleased I bought.

HOWEVER, if there was a design fault, it would be this: when you start and then stop the stop watch, you cannot reset without pressing and holding the reset button; surely it would be better for a one-touch reset?  Also, with the Timer - loop 3 (which is continuous countdown) the reset button (again press and hold) resets the timer to zero (as you would expect the 'set' button to do), and the set button (press and hold) resets the timer to the original timer setting (eg 5 mins) - surely these are the wrong way round?  All a bit odd, but sort-of OK once you get used to it.  Seems a bit sloppy though in its design.

Nonetheless, overall an excellent watch.  I'm really please I bought it and it's very useful for triathlon events, using the lap on the stopwatch

My last Ironman lasted 12 years of very hard usage in the restaurant business---lots of heat, grease and water! My new Timex Combo Dual Tech Watch has all the same features, especially the timers which I can set at different intervals. You can't beat the price for this rugged but sleak looking watch. A plus---it has both digital time and good old watch hands

This watch met all my requirements, and it well suited for my hand. 
I liked the feature of turning the digital display ON & OFF. The strap is also smooth, doest hurt ur skin. 
The only negative remark I found with this watch is the INDIGLO night-light is not that bright as I expected or was not equivalent to my previous watch.

This watch is great.  It has full iron man functionality and actually looks nicer than a geeky casio - unlike prior iron man watches.  I probably should have gone with the steel band as it could be worn out as well.  It has solid construction and easy functionality.  The indiglo could be a little brighter but I am sure that would cost battery life.

I'm a wristwatch fan, and I have a modest collection of nice luxury watches, and I was looking for something inexpensive that I could use for "rough" activities where I don't want to damage my nicer Omega or Rolex watches. I wanted something with sport functions and alarm.

Most sports watches with digital displays (e.g. Casio or even other Timex Ironmans) are pretty ugly, they look out of place wearing anything but sweats and sneakers. But I was pleasantly surprised by this Timex model. You can turn off the digital display and it looks like a reasonable handsome analog watch, but one press and the display functions appear again. However, there are some drawbacks:
- the digits can be hidden by the thick hands of the analog display.
- The white on black digital display isn't very clear except in good light. You'll be using the Indiglo backlight often.

The rest of the watch is pretty nice overall. The casing is heavy, and thick but thanks to the comfortable rubber band, I don't find the watch annoying on my small wrist. The loop on the band to hold the end of the band secure stays put pretty well. The overall weight is hefty but not as overbearing as some other watches with metal straps. The finish isn't exactly Rolex quality, it looks like what you expect a $50 watch, the brushing is a bit uneven. The design is modern and smooth, and the watch looks a bit more expensive than it is.

The functions of the watch are pretty typical of any digital watch. There isn't anything about the watch I find confusing. As long as you walk through the functions once in the manual, you shouldn't have problems doing it again later without the manual. Usually you have to hold the top left button to go into set modes, and the other buttons go up/down or advance the setting mode. I could completely figure out the watch without the manual. 

As for the sport functions, the three loop countdown timers allow you to set up intervals. For example, you can one loop to time running interval, and then a second loop for the walk break. The chrono function keeps track of 42 laps, and you can see each lap time in the recall mode. However, because the hands can easily cover the digits, I wouldn't suggest this watch if you really need to be able to read the digits at all times, stick with a digital only Ironman model

The Indiglo backlight just adds enough light to the digits to allow you to see the light in any lighting condition, but as I said, you'll more likely to use it in this watch because of the low contrast of the digits. The Alarm is average for a digital watch, it is good enough to wake most people when placed on the bedside (it isn't very loud worn on the wirst)

This is a Big watch for the price!
(44mm I believe)....You have to buy a vintage dive watch to find one this large..... I agree with the other reviewer about the strap.I  lost a Casio just like this before @ the beach .I now have a "waterborne" dive-strap on my new one.....a one directional bezel & a screw-down crown would be nice on future models...Also be ready to be asked  "What Time is it?" a lot when you wear it to the Beach ...;)

This model has been out for a long time. I like the look of the black more then the white or gold. The reason the watch loses one star is because the band. It looks great, but the rubber will wear out and break in about a year. The replacement band that Casio offers looks close the orginal, but not exactly the same. I lost one of these, and another was stolen. So the fact that I am on my third is a statement to how much I love this watch. I have been wearing it since about 1993

I bought this necklace along with 13 other Hematite Necklaces they are all Absolutely Beautiful and the quality is exceptional and the price is awesome you can not beat it. Shipping and handling was very reasonable also. Here is some information on Hematite and why it is one of my favorite stones:
Hematite: Element Earth 
Chakras: Root (1st)
Hematite is the most effective of all stones for grounding oneself in the body and physical world. It can counteract spaciness and confusion, helping one to see the practical concerns and move forward with useful action. Hematite can be used to balance the auric field and align the chakras. It pulls stray energies down through the meridian sytem to the root chakra. Hematite can help one see the silver lining on every dark cloud and the light at the end of every tunnel. It lends one strength, courage and fortitude for moving through adversity. It is excellent for energetic support of recovery from any ailment of the blood and of blood production within bone marrow. It can work as a strengthener for the liver and can assist in the detoxification process.

These earrings are very pretty-- not too big not too small, just right.  For the price you can't go wrong.  The gift box they arrived in was sort of cheesy, but they were for ME so I didn't mind.  If I were giving them as a gift I'd put them in a prettier box before giving them to the recipient.

Overall very pretty earrings, good value, no complaints

The earrings are gorgeous, kind of a hematite color--but they look darker, nearly black, against fair skin.  Beautiful!  And this COMPANY!  The earrings went on sale after I ordered (and paid for) them and they automatically credited my card/account for the difference.  Wow!  I am *very* happy with this purchase and will definitely buy from Securehoop again

I got this because it was a simple design but still looked good without costing too much.  My only complaint is that my wrists are super small and I had to get links removed, but that was no big deal.  I only wear it when I need to dress up, so it's still in good shape.

I received these earrings as a Christmas gift from my sister.  They are perfect.  Their size is about the circumference of a dime.  Platinum adds elegance and yet, they are perfect for simple everyday wear.  You know they will never tarnish nor will they irritate your ears.  They are also perfect for young lady's first introduction to platinum jewelry.

This is a really nice little pendant/necklace.  The stones are not too small, not too big -- the pendant is about 1" long.  The bail is large enough to accommodate a nice chain (it comes with an 18" fine chain, but you might want to replace it with something a bit more substantial).

For the price, I was expecting something a lot "cheaper" looking.  I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of this.

I had a previous Expedition watch that lasted many years and served me well. I purchased this new version and so far haven't been disappointed. If you're looking for a basic watch that tells time and has a backlight, I don't think you can go wrong for the money

I purchased this item to show my work to potential buyers. I found that it is effective to show many of my pieces, and the materials used to make this folder is exceptional.  Very professional looking and easy to carry around.  If you have a ton of items then they tend to get tangled, but I don't believe it is intended for that purpose

The pendant is gorgeous and feels substantial. Quick delivery and the product was delivered as promised. The chain is a little long (for me) so the pendant hangs at about breastbone level, but it's so lovely I haven't bothered to find a new chain

I love this watch. It was my Christmas present to myself.  The ribbons are easy to interchange, and I wear them with the silver bracelet, as well.  It comes in a cute and durable box that I now use to store all of my watches.  A perfect gift and good quality.  I especially like the little heart on the minute sweep

This is the first time I settled for "byzantine" style of jewelry but I like it. It is a big and shining bracelet that perfectly matches with dark or black clothes. It would make an excellent gift for a man especially if the guy is not skinny

I have received many compliments on the Sterling Silver Byzantine Bracelet, 7.5".  It is a nice size (~1/4" diameter).  It is a beautiful link.  It is a really nice peice:  perfect for both casual and formal wear.  The only things I did not like are that the bracelet is not totally cylindrical (it is flat on one side) and some of the links are welded together (not that this really matters because no one can see this).  However, compared to the byzantine bracelet I had had in the past, it is fantastic.  That one kept breaking apart any time it got caught on anything because the rings were not welded closed.  The fact that these are (even if some are welded together) is a fantastic feature

I own about 27 various expensive brands of quartz watches and finally decided it was time to invest in an automatic. I knew stories from other people who own them and claim that it's important to have a good watch winder, so, I saw this one and decided I'd give it a try. I could not see the point in spending hundreds of dollars on a winder when I could use that money towards another watch! :)   I ordered this before I even received my new Invicta Automatic Pro Diver watch.
I have very tiny wrists, and because of that, at first I did not think the spring loader was going to work for me. I struggled a bit to fit my watch in the holder but after about 15 minutes, I got it.  I have been using the watch winder off and on now for over a week and I think it does a great job. My automatic is only 1 minute fast, and although I'm not sure if that speaks more for the quality of the watch or the winder, all I can say is I think the product is doing what it is supposed to do and the watch is keeping time well.
I put it on the winder each night before bed. It's fairly quiet but that is just my opinion. I have read other reviews where people said it was loud. I expected it to be louder than it is.
Like other reviewers, I am unsure of how much is "too much" winding. I think most watches have a built in mechanism that prevents overwinding so I guess putting it in the winder each night is ok.
My only problem now is the lonely empty space where another automatic needs to be since it is a double winder. Hmmmm......time to get another watch!    :)   If you need a winder, get this. It works well and you can save the extra money and get yourself another watch to add to your collection

I went onto Ebay and found the same product for slightly less but the shipping was outrageous!  Great product.  Clockwise or counter clockwise rotation.  I have it in my office on the back of my desk and I can barely hear it working if I pay attention to it.  Nice design and looks good

I purchased this watch winder as part of my husband's Christmas gifts this year to pair with his new Tag Heuer Carrera. I compared this winder to many others out there in all price ranges and this one is actually the same winder many luxury stores (ie. Neiman Marcus) carry, sans branding. It's very quiet and the interval winding keeps his watches running without risking over-winding. 

You can save a lot of money by forgoing the leather wrapping or wood veneer packaging on the more expensive winders and just get this one.

This dual watch winder is awesome.  Not only is it ultra stylish but it works great.  Although I have expensive tastes when it comes to watches, I cannot justify paying more than $100 for a watch winder that no one will ever see.  This dual watch winder works great with my Tag Heuer-Link and my Movado.  It's truly a great buy, no reason to spend more money

I love the watch expecially, with the black white color. Looks the casio of the old, with a modern twist. The watch is very basic in design. A dual digital, fully funtional chronograpgh watch. One other thing; it is very easy to set. The only problem is, it is not back lit. So the digital part of the watch is useless at night (if incase you happen to be doing something in the dark, at night).This is the only disappointing fact about the wrist watch.            You might think a watch that cost $60 will have a self supplied light, but it does not. SAD. SHAME ON CASIO. Apart from that, i love the watch

I have bought this watch for him every 6 years.  He has owned three so far.   After replacing the battery, it is not as water resistant.  Also, the band has broken on two out of the three of the watches.  I gave it 4 stars because of the degradable band.  No other watch has movable bezel, analog and digital time, with an alarm, for under $100.00.

This is a great looking watch.  It is handsome and elegant. The face is large and easily viewed.  The style is easily those you see in $1000+ watches, but obviously does not have the engineering of the more upscale models.  A real bargain for such a handsome watch.

I am very pleased with this product and have had numerous positive comments about how sharp the timepiece looks.  The dial is much larger than most watches but I have big wrists so it was perfect.  The size also gives an updated look.  The only negative comment I have is that the watch is pretty thick and binds on shirt cuffs but that is a minimal problem.  Great reproduction watch

This pendant is small, about the size of a dime, and very light. It is one-sided - the opposite side is hollow. It appears exactly as shown. The chain it comes with is 18", which is pretty standard, and has a circular clasp with the knob you have to pull on

Shpping items like these to an african country will always be scary, but it arrived in very good condition. Nothing was damaged, and the chain and little black pouch was well picked. It was a surprise pendant for my girlfriend, she expected just one item, but this moon was well priced, so I bought it with another pendant. You are lucky to get such beautifully crafted art at this price. It is strong, so no need to worry about breakage during shiping.
I like it, and wish I could keep it, but it was a gift.

Very beautiful pearls. There are visible blemishes, which makes them appropriate to wear at work without me feeling overdressed. The uniformity is very good. All pearls are more or less same size. Beautiful clasps too. However I have to agree with the previous reviewer that it is hard to handle without help, especially the bracelet. Took me about 10 minutes to put it on my wrist. The color is slightly yellowish. The shape is good: kinda semiround rather than potato. They'll make great gifts.

The set is absolutely gorgeous in person, and I'm sure that it will only get better over time as the pearls gain in luster. The clasp is also very beautiful with an intricate design, and it's incredibly secure when fastened; however, it's difficult to maneuver and I can't imagine ever being able to put the necklace on - or get it off - without assistance. That's the only reason I wouldn't give this five stars - the quality and the value of this set are otherwise great

I have recently bought this pair of earing and the matching bracelet for my son's care-giver.  When it arrived my sisters and I were tempted to keep them for ourselves, they were lovely.  I particularly like the make and the feel of the bracelet. They are what I would term "fun" pieces but not in the least suggesting that they are for younger persons only.  I am in my 40s and would enjoy wearing these pieces.
It was a good buy at the sale price.
Oddly enough I also liked the packaging, the items came in a regular protective brown cardboard box that protected the little "gift boxes" on the inside

My husband is very picky. He LOVES this watch. He has gone through a lot of them and loves that it's dressy yet casual and can wear it anywhere. He loves that it's a substantial weight  and the bracelet came extra long. He's 6'2 and "large boned". Had a watch repair shop take a couple links out for only $5. Great investment

I was honestly expecting some cheap necklace that felt like plastic, considering the price.  I was so very wrong! The necklace is gorgeous! The clasp is sturdy and not easy broke.  Package it was mailed in was also very good. I am able to Christmas wrap it in the package provided.  Excellent service.  THANK YOU!!

This is my second one of these winders, so obviously I'm a fan. Winds my Rolexes and a few other ETA autos perfectly, but it doesn't seem to keep my Seiko kinetic diver or Panerais wound sufficiently. Still, as far as I'm concerned, it spreads the lubrication enough to keep the watches in good health. For the price point, this winder cannot be beat and I will purchase more in the future. The auto timer keeps the winder running cool. Fairly silent rotation, depending on the watch. While the gear rotations themselves are completely silent, sometimes there's a slight shift of the watch as it goes around, which makes a repetitive sound. Nothing I can't live with. Highly recommended

I've read all of the reviews . I too own this model . It does what it was designed to do . BURLWOOD is much more ....overpriced ? People sometimes need to be taken by the hand . Especially the overpriveleged . You don't know what it's like to be rich untill you've been poor . AND...you don't know how good your winder is till' you find the proper direction . AS in all things , others are not going to do it for you ALL of the time . BUT in this case I'll make an exception . Some watches wind in both directions...you know - GO BOTH WAYS ? AS do a lot of ....back to the winder lesson , and some only go ONE WAY . Find out what way you need to go and GO THERE !...PROBLEM SOLVED ( help me..this isn't working...oh , PLEASE ! ) The moral too this story is "in a plastic world try not to always have WOOD !! GOD gave you a brain . Read my revie

This watch is a great looking watch and the indigo light gives it all it needs to meet your everyday use.  Because of its gold tone and silver tone band you don't have to worry about what color jewelry you wear with it because it matches it all.  Well worth the price

I wanted a watch with a metal band and a large analog dial. I wasn't quite sure that I would like this watch when it arrived. It was a women's style, but it was larger than I thought it would be. I had to first take it to have some of the links removed, but I was amazed at how light it was when I had it on. I love the easy to read face and the indigo feature is a must for any watch you own. I wear it everyday and I love it. It arrived with a brand new battery and the stem was pulled out so you knew the battery was new. I recommend this watch

I really like my new Timex.  It is very classy looking and the face is very easy to read. I like the date feature and the lighted face in the dark. The only drawback was, I had to take it to my jeweler to have some links removed, but the charge was minimal. All in all, good value for the price

I work in construction and am constantly having to replace my watches because of damage, this watch is great because it is sturdy and can be clipped out of the way to prevent breakage

My trusty Seiko of 21 years gave out recently (I should really remember to take it off when doing strenuous labor) and I went in search of a similar style.  I received this replacement about a week ago and I love it already.  It's light-weight and easy to read in the light or dark

This watch was purchased as a gift and I was pleasantly surprised when I received it.  The quality is excellent.  I had read in another review that the watch was a little bulky, but I found it to be in line with watches of the same type.  This watch works well with casual and work attire and I was tempted to keep the watch for myself.  In fact I regret not purchasing one for me to keep.  Buy with confidence.

I received this off my wish list from a dear friend and I must say, it's stunning.  It's both delicate and sturdy.  The craftsman's shift is beautiful, in what you would expect a piece to cost four times this amount.  The stone is beautiful and large, without being gaudy.

It's a stunning piece of work.  All you lads out there, should buy this for you lass, and make her very happy!

Wonderful piece I highly recommend for quality and price

I bought these earrings for my niece, and after they arrived, I immediately ordered another pair for myself. I find them actually nicer in reality than in the picture. The size is perfect, and the amethysts, although very small, add just a little color accent. I bought them on sale for $15 instead of the usual $50, and I am very, very pleased with what I got for the price

I use this watch both as a daily timepiece and for timing my runs. The ability to turn off the digital display gives it a refined look, even for an Ironman series. I like the catch incorporated into the watch band so it doesn't pull out of the guide (something that used to drive me crazy with my other watches). If you're looking for a sports watch that you can wear out on the town, this fits the bill.

I found this pair of studs to be nice for everyday wear.    They look much better than the ones found in Macy's fine jewelry and they cost less.  Personally I would not go over 1/3 ctw with this quality because the flaws would become obvious.  I am very satisfied with my purchase

My husband has really liked this watch so far.  The price was great for such a elegant looking watch.  He wears it when he dresses up.  He really likes that it is Kinetic.  We don't have to worry about replacing the battery.  The last watch I bought him was a fossil and we had to send it to their servicing center when the battery died and had to wait 4-6 weeks.  The kinetic seems to be working out great

This is a sleek, sharp, quality watch, and the lowest priced model that I've seen in the arctura series. If you can catch it on sale, I think its a great buy. However, be prepared for the weight. This is the heaviest watch I've ever worn, and probably the largest. If you're used to wearing stainless watches, it will probably be fine for you. I'm used to leather bands, and the weight difference is quite noticeable. Wish I could find this watch in titanium, that would be perfect. Overall, if you're not bothered by the large size or weight, it looks great, and I'm sure the quality is also.

I like it beacuse you can hang almost anything from it, and it looks good.
The only downside is that the clasp is too big to get more delicate items on to it.

I love this bracelet but the clasp is seriously defective.  I contacted Sabrina, and they were great about sending me a new one ASAP, with a label for returning the other one.  That was impressive, and such responsive customer service is not to be undervalued.  Still, the clasp is a product defect, and I'm sure one of these days I will probably loose the bracelet b/c it comes undone unknowingly

These earrings are so cute!  They are a great size for a toddler, but probably a little large for a small infant.  It is so hard to find safety back earrings that are cute.  These are a beautiful rose pink color - very sweet.

I rounded up from a 4.5.  The shipping was on time.  It was within the specification advertised, but one of the diamonds is much more yellow than the others, even without a hand lense it is visible.  Other than that I am very happy with the service and product.

Thank You,

I bought this watch for my husband for his bday. It was a great bargain, very stylish, and he loves it. The only problem we encountered was w/ the so-called "smart link" band.  It was supposedly designed for the customer to resize the band at home, but after numerous failed attempts, we gave up. We Googled it and found several people who encountered similar problems solving the smart link mystery but no one offered a solution. Even the Fossil website was no help. We ended up paying a jeweler who sells Fossil watches $10 to resize the band.  Other than that, my husband is very satisfied with this watch.

I wanted an automatic watch for a while, and I was attracted to the green trim on this model. The watch is big and heavy. This is probably true of most automatics. My issue is that it seems to be too thick. I think the glass/crystal back adds a millimeter or so. 
The band has a slight problem that I can probably fix. Right where the metal of the band contacts the case, one side of the band has bent slightly causing the band to interfere with the rotating bezel. I may have caused this when adjusting the linkage, or it may have come delivered that way. I think I could simply detach the band and squeeze it back into its proper shape. I have actually left it alone as I do not want the bezel to rotate, and the defect is not visible.
As far as accuracy, it seems to have gained about 20-30sec in a week. 
Had I seen the watch in a store and tried it on, I would probably not have bought it. I was not happy when it arrived, but I have worn it for a week, and I am now glad that I picked it.
The only other issue is that I wish the luminous markings were brighter. I purposely picked the black face to be easier to see the markings in the dark (as opposed to the white face), but I have had better luck with other watches

I am a college student and member of the Army Reserve with knowledge of manufacturing/production processes.  I value pieces of fine engineering, precision and design.  I have always admired automatic watches, someday when I can afford one I will purchase an Omega or Rolex.

I can tell that in my particular watch there is a minute dust on the hour hand and on the pendulum.

First off, this watch should be appreciated for what it is, an automatic watch for a reasonable price.  There are no batteries, no electronics, just gears and springs.  Some automatic/kinetic/whatever watches use a pendulum to charge a small battery, these do not interest me.

Pros:  automatic movement, sharp visual appeal, day/date function, supposed shock resistance (haven't beat it up enough to know if this is true but I trust the claim having researched the manufacturing of the movement).  See-thru case back so you can watch the mechanism do its thing!

Cons:  It is not a Rolex, so don't expect perfection.  The band and case are solid but lack the heft, fit and finish of a Rolex level watch.

Bottom Line:  If you want a truly automatic watch for about 100 bucks this is a great choice.  Orient watches and other Invicta models are supposedly are just as good.  You will get compliments on this watch

I am pleased with this watch.  It is inexpensive, yet has a lot of features.    The only negative is that the band is a cloth material and not as easy to keep clean as it would with a leather band.

As I said in my review of the bracelet, (which I bought together), I thought from the pictures that they might be bigger, however my wife was pleasantly surprised.They look much more expensive than they are. This is my first experience with cz but not my last (we're remodling a house). I recommend this seller for their shipping & quality of merchandise

I bought this pair of earrings for myself over a year ago...when they were new to Amazon (no reviews).  I wanted something that looked pretty but didn't cost me a lot.  I loved them....loved them so much that when I lost one down my sink drain, I wanted to buy another pair.  I am currently waiting to receive my second pair.  For the price and the beauty, why not!  No one will know they aren't real diamonds

I purchased this watch on Amazon after looking at the same watch in JC Penny and Dillards for almost $200.00 more. It's a nice casual watch, I wear mine to work as a nurse and its very durable and attractive. The mother of pearl face is a pale pink so it doesn't clash when wearing other colors. For the price, Seiko watches are great, mine usually last about 10 years of frequent wear getting wet regularly.

The watch performs as advertised.

Atomic clock.  I live 2k miles from Ft. Collins and the watch automatically syncs every night, even if I don't put it near a window.

Solar recharge.  The watch arrived with a low battery.  It charged up to full after sitting in the sun for an afternoon.  Since then it has been on full charge with no special actions on my part.

The watch is big and heavy.  I take it off when typing because it slides down to the end of my wrist and knocks against my hand.

The watch's user interface is unintuitive.  This is the first watch I've owned where I had to read (and re-read) the manual to set an alarm or the hourly charm. I find the Timex interface and the old-style Casio interface much easier to use.

In the interests of saving battery power, the alarms are short and quiet.  I can't count on this watch's alarms to wake me up.  It'd be nice if the watch had a power-hog mode with loud insistent alarms and long illuminations.

All in all, I like the watch.  It is nice to have a digital watch that sets its own time and doesn't run out of batteries.  I wish the user interface was more intuitive, the alarms were more effective, and the watch was smaller

The watch arrived in timely fashion and was already set up.  This watch is super.  However, it lacks a timer.  I left the Timex Ironman for this watch.  Timex's quality is horrid (a watch per year) and I changed to the Casion G-Shock based on a recommendation of a friend.  I am glad I did.  If they ever get a timer in this watch I'd buy another

This watch arrived very quickly, and it is a very fine watch.  I had an earlier Casio Ceptor watch and the battery died, I couldn't find anyone to replace it so I needed a new watch.  By the time I had ordered this watch, I actually replaced the battery myself in the old one.  So now I have two atomic watches, but the G-shock is superior by far and is ruggedly sturdy and should last indefinately with the solar power, just be sure to get it to full charge by putting it in direct sunlight until it indicates full charge.  A great deal

I am in the Army and because of that this watch has it's pluses and minuses.  I travel the world, so the multiple time zones is awsome.  The time stamp feature is great for when I need help remember when a specific event happened.  As for the solar power.  It's great in that you don't have to worry about batteries, but most watch batteries last close to five years anyway.  In the Army I find myself doing lots of night missions, and I can go months without seeing the sun because I have to catch up on sleep during the day.  Well, this doesn't really work with a solar powered watch.  I get by, but it can be a hassle some times.  All-in-all, this is a great watch, and if you don't work at night then the solar power won't be a problem for you, except maybe in the winter when you wear coats that cover your wrist.  Just take that into consideration when purchasing a solar powered watch

Ditto to all the positive comments on the previous posts. However, I have not had the problems with the bands like the many have mentioned. I've had two of these watches now, going on third as the battery has died on number 2, and I have never had an issue with the bands on my first two. I wear mine all day, every day, even in the pool or shower, and it's held up well. The light did go out seemingly "too soon" but then I notice the battery was beginning to fade as well at the same time. I wear mine all day, every day, in pool and shower, and it's held up remarkably well. The only negative is that it seems the battery goes quickly ... but maybe that's due to using the alarm daily and training with it. 

It is an inexpensive watch (compared to many other options that are out there) and given its ease of use, its very readable face, and sleek look, I'd take the chance on it

This is my second "Sleek 50" -- the first was fine until the battery died, then I tried to put in a new battery (bad idea)and managed to mess up some of the inner workings. 

Highly recommended (the watch -- not changing the battery!

I went out on a limb and decided to surprise my wife with these for Valentine's day.  I purchased the white gold version for her, and to my great astonishment, my wife was pleased by my jewelry choice - a first!

They come in a smallish box, with a smaller felt bag - that holds the tiny earings (the picture in Amazon must be under a micron microscope!).

They are tasteful, and understated

I love, love these earrings. I bought them because I wanted a pair of earrings to wear all of the time. Unless there is something special then I will change for a special occasion. But, these earrings I wear in the shower ---- they are always shinning and they never rust because they are real gold. I received these earrings before the scheduled delivery date

The earrings delivered were as described and will certainly work for me.  I was a bit disappointed in the strength and flexibility of the gold wire.  These earrings were much more flexible that the 25-year-old pair I was replacing.  I doubt that the new ones are as strong and will hold up as well.  However, they do what I need them to do and can be worn around the clock without irritation

I bought a Nighthawk (although one with a leather band) about a year ago and I have been very pleased with it. It looks very masculine and classy, and the style will certainly age well. The slide rule takes a little figuring out, but it's very useful. It keeps time pretty well, too. I've only got a couple of complaints:

The leather band, which I picked because metal bands have always been uncomfortable for me, is a little too large for my wrist. Even when I use the innermost hole in the band, the watch is still kind of floppy. 

For the price, the watch could have a sapphire crystal instead of a glass one. 

Those conplaints are very minor compared to everything I like about the watch. I didn't want to give the watch five stars if I had complaints about it, but my rating would probably be more like 4.75 stars. For the price, it's a great value.

This is my fourth (a fifth, limited-edition is on order) Eco-Drive. I collect a lot of watches but these are some of my favs to actually wear and use. They are the most accurate watches I've ever owned, bar-none.  The Nighthawk is solid, well made, and a delight to wear.  There are few watches on which I'd change nothing, but this is one.  I also got an excellent price and great service.  Many thanks

Threaders are "in" and these are about the most elegant looking threaders I've seen.  The stones are a nice size and it is obvious that it is a butterfly.  It is nice to have such a refined option for such a "hip" style.

I purchsed this watch a while ago and I have to say it is simply great. The animated feature is simply the face switching between red and black which can be set to hold at either color, which is a feature I have found to to very fuctional as it allows for me to switch to the color that better complitments what I am wearing. I have had this watch for nearly a year and it still gets comlpiments weekly. My only criticism comes from the fact that it is not like some of more of the trend watches that have a wide band that actually cuff around the entire wrist, from which this watch takes its styling cues. Nevertheless, it is still a great watch that looks good

This is a gorgeous and "delicate" looking watch. I can read it without my glasses and so far it works. I've had trouble with Timex in the past, so I hope this holds up well. It is very pretty and can go with casual or a nice dress in the evening

I chose this watch because of the stunning, and currently very fashionable, 'Rolex green' colour - and because the price was right. 
So how does it stack up? 
Nice bright yellow display box to keep it safe during shipping and storage, watch was well protected as well with clear plastic wrap over all surfaces. 
The quality and finish are excellent, and the watch is easy to set for day and date. 
It has a clear back, so you can see the motion spring mechanism at work - pretty cool. 
Clasp and strap are well finished and work well - rotating bezel lines up perfectly at 12 O'clock - nice sweeping hand movement. Great look and great value

I love this watch, and I love the price. It looks good both casual and dressy. It goes with just about anything. The people at Invicta are really right in that you should try to match your watch with your belt and such.

The material is high quality. I have large wrists, so it's tricky to get on and off initially because the leather is quite stiff. But it's been loosening and so it's much easier now

I have had this watch for a few months, and so far it has served me well.  It is very solidly built, and has survived a few falls already.  It is accurate enough to get me to work on time.  I do have to wind it about once every week or two, mainly because I don't move my arm enough, I think.  Note that this watch is fairly big (on me anyway) and the strap is quite stiff when new.  It has started to loosen up now that I have had it for a while.  I like the look, and I think it is dressy enough to wear with a suit, but still casual enough that it doesn't look out of place with jeans either.  A reasonable price for a decent watch

I very much like these earrings.  My only reason for not giving them a 5-star rating is that the topaz is quite small.  You really have to look closely to see it.  But, they are excellent quality sterling silver and still beautiful.  I recommend them, just be aware that the stones are tiny

My boyfriend got me this watch for Valentine's Day and it is gorgeous!  The face is very small as other reviewers have indicated, so if the recipient likes smaller face watches (as I do), this is a great gift.  It looks more like a bracelet than a watch; good for small wrists.  Elegant-looking & classy.  I love it!

This is a very nice watch.  It is smaller than it looks in the picture, but I actually like it better that way--it is delicate and lady-like.  The pink face is subdued and the steel band is polished.  It makes a nice dressy or everyday watch.  I have seen similar Seikos in the stores for much more money.

My reaction is quite similar to the other reviewer.  I received my watch a few weeks ago (only took three days) and was impressed by its classy look---all my other casios have been basic black clunkers.  I like that the toggle switches protrude, so it's easy to activate them---those old recessed ones drove me crazy trying to get a nail or golf tee in there. It has all the features I wanted, but I had the same reaction about the alarm.  It's less assertive than the other casios I've had, and I don't think I can trust it to wake me up early or if I'm tired. I've already decided to buy an inexpensive alarm to put by my bed.  Because the screen showing the digital data is small, it's not always easy to read what's on it, especially if the watch hand is partially obscuring the screen, which somehow seems to happen a lot.  The back light only goes on one second at a time, and isn't very strong, so there's a good chance that you won't be able to read the digital screen that quickly.  FYI, the 10 year battery claim is based on using one second of backlight each day, so you better look quick and look sharp----but not often.  So.......great looks, but personality could be better.  That's life

Bought these as a Christmas gift, and think think they are adorable! Great for a second or third hole to add a splash of color. Possibly perfect for a young daughter's first hole. The stones have a very nice sparkle. Wasn't sure if 3mm would be too small, but I think these will do just fine. This set came individually boxed but in a clear plastic holder so that you can easily give as a set, or break them up for individual wrapping. For $49, I'm very satisfied

I am very pleased with the locket.  It is a nice size, but not too big-definitely large enough to be engraved. The chain is pretty and appears to be strong.  It arrives in a lovely black velvet pouch and box.  My daughter was delighted with it

This necklace is beautiful.  The chain is not skimpy and the heart locket itself is really pretty.  A great alternative to an expensive locket at a fine jeweler.  A true steal at a sale price of under $30.00

I believe the heart shaped locket is a one-of-a-kind thing.  It is appropriately sized to allow for sufficient size pictures while not being too large.  The silver is clean and smooth looking just like the pictures.  Due to the size of the locket, a dainty, smaller chain is sturdy but does not detract from the locket.  Therefore, while I was concerned about the chain size and negative reviews, I took a risk and am happy with this purchase.  The pictures were easy to insert and there is a plastic film to put over the pictures for finger prints and some protection.
Good gift.
Sincerely,
The guy who usually blows it on the Valentine's Day gift.

The facets make the chain quite sparkly. I found it perfect for all my pendants, not flimsy but not too heavy, and not twisty like some other type chains.

I had seen the "gold/orange" face version of this Casio watch for years but didn't know it came in black (and white) until I found it on Amazon. I really like the classic good looks of this watch... nice rugged case, smooth-clicking rotating bezel, sturdy band, etc. For &lt;$60, this watch truly delivers awesome quality and value. The digital features are great too. I've received a few compliments from co-workers on this watch already. Overall, an awesome watch for the money and I couldn't be happier with it

I've owned this model for about seven years and I think I'll buy another to keep on standby in case I break the original (I'm not gentle with my watches while working/playing).

Tough, pretty easy to set, good features, and classic "diver" style at a great price. What's not to like? Wouldn't mind having a light on the LCD, otherwise it is proven a great investment.

Battery lasts ~2 years with the alarm going off every day and watch band life is about the same (cracks develop after a while). No corrosion (duh, stainless steel) and good resistance to scratches on the crystal so far.

Beautiful box to hold most of my watches.  Have two other watch boxes that hold 11 watches ea and some rings.  This box holds those watches in less space!  Having no place for the rings is not a minus in my opinion.  Nice being able to see 10 of my most worn watches at a glance!  Another 10 in the drawer below.  If you have several watches that you want to put in a nice looking, good quality box you will not go wrong buying this item

I bought this watch a couple months ago and it is superb. It IS a BIG watch but I am a big man and it looks quite hansom on my wrist,but if your not a big guy I woudnt recommend this model. Now onto the timekeeping.When I received the watch it ran a bit fast (30 sec. daily) so instead of waiting the 6 weeks to sent it to Seiko for repair, I took it to the local Seiko dealership/jeweler and had them regulate it for $30, well worth the money and now it runs great. This watch is an absolute tank, I wear it every day, it gets banged around quite a bit, and there has yet to be even the slightest scratch in the hardlex crystal.

I love this watch,
  I thought by looking at the pictures and reading other comments that it was going to be big and bulky. I was immediately surprised at how light it was. It is easy to read and keeps good time. It is also a very handsome watch. The rotating bezel is a quick and easy way to time anything (lasting less than a hour). Highly recommended!

Oddly, the SKX175 I received is actually a SKX009K! What a steal at $129!

The watch is a 5-star based on price alone. But the jubilee bracelet gets a 1-star!! It's cheap feeling and loose. The center links are fold-over, NOT solid. At this price though, it's not surprising that something got cheaped out like that.

Overall, I give it a 4-star rating. Missing tag!!! False advertising (perhaps to the benefit, as the 009K is perceived a little better) that it's really a SKX009K rather than a SKX175 (has Singapore labeling on lower edge of dialface, whereas the SKX009K does not have any country markings). Great buy for sure!!

cheers

This watch is a classic. I have no issues with it losing minutes. i am very tough on watches, i never take them off, and this watch has been a real tank. i was needlessly worried that the red and blue dial would chip or be scratched off. i am amazed that it has not b/c i have accidentally scraped, smashed it into doors, walls etc...same for the dial, tough as diamonds. it is a BIG watch, so it may not be for everyone, but if you like the styling, it is a steal. and the seals will never weaken b/c it will never be opened to change a battery. i am very impressed

These are very well crafted little earrings. I love how they look, and the price just can't be beat! These have made me want to buy many more things from Silver Insanity! The only problem I did experience with these earrings is that the post is rather long, and it pokes the side of my head when I sleep. Otherwise, I couldn't love them more!

As a tarantula keeper (I have 5 at home), I always try to look for unique items such as these. Caution- they are really tiny! I've already lost one of them. (Guess it scurried away)
It's nice to see that they actually look like tarantulas and not true spiders

PROS:
The blue topaz stone is beautiful with great quality and great cut.
The white gold is a perfect choice to combine with the blue of the stone and the diamonds.
CONS:
the chain is kind small and thin.
the diamonds are tiny with less than good quality.
OVERALL:
I am a pleased customer.
I bought it as a gift for the Topaz stone not for the diamonds or the chain.
By the way she looks stunning with this necklace

I was kind of worried when I read some of the other reviews for this, but I'm so glad I ordered it!  It is sooooo much more beautiful in person than in the picture.  It's wonderfully sparkly and just the right size.  It did take a bit long to ship, but it was worth the wait

needed a gift for my mother in law who has everything; including great taste.  she collecgts the swarovski figures but didnt have any of their jewelry.  i came upon this accidentaly and took a chance on ordering it.  it arrived promptly; in time for Christmas; and it is very stunning.  not gaudy at all; just classic style beauty.  could probably be worn to her office each day (upscale casual) or if she is dressed up.   the price absolutely could not be beaten for what you are getting.  i liked it so much i wanted to get one for myself; and i am not a huge jewelry fan

This product has helprd me to easily open the back of my watch and replace the battery.  I am sure it will satisfy me when I want to change the battery on my more expensive watch that has the back that screws on.  But also since I have "N" scale model trains the tweezers and small tools have been most helpful. i.e pliers, hammer, etc

This is a good collection of tools that you should have if you want to do minor watch repairs at home.  I had 5-6 watches lying around and I could not use them coz they ran out of battery.  Was able to open all of them with tools in this kit.  It doesnt have any user guide but if you have used tools then you will be able to figure out where to use what and how.  The quality of products is pretty good too .. at least nothing broke during fixing 5-6 watches yet.

I am very happy with the purchase.  The hammer was missing from the kit and when I called the customer service, they immediately sent me the hammer

This is an excellent tool set for beginners. The quality of the tools is not professional grade, but more than adequate for the hobbyists. For the price you pay, this is an excellent deal. A little more money than some of the other kits being sold on Amazon.com, but well worth it as you get a complete set

I bought this necklace because it was very on sale, and I was surprised by how much I loved it when it arrived. The beads are actually somewhat darker than they appear in the picture, which looks nicer and is easier to match to an outfit. It's a bold necklace, but it can dress down quite a bit with the right blouse

I was browsing through Amazon when I came upon Nvie jewelry and I absolutely love it! I bought this necklace for my mom for her birthday, but had a hard time not keeping it for myself. The necklace was really nice, well constructed, and it was shipped quickly. It looked just like the picture, but I have a feeling that each piece of jewelry is truly one-of-a-kind.I would recommend Nvie Designs to anyone for buying really lovely, affordably priced jewelry.

The watch is very pretty, sturdy enough for everyday wear and elegant enough for dressy occasions.  Excellent price and fast delivery.  I like the dual tone watch band, because I wear both white and yellow gold.  The gold isn't as brassy as what shows in the picture.  Excellent value

Very nice piece, just beware of the size, it's much bigger than it appears in this picture.

It does hang nice on the silver cord, however, the clasp is backwards, and with the cord, it does not flex to the correct position.

I just received this today.  Somehow I completely missed that the pendant is on a silver-wrapped wire and not a chain.  Had I noticed that, I probably would not have ordered this piece - and I would have missed out.  It is very nice.  It has a nice weight to it - not too heavy, but substantial.  The wire lays on my neckline just right, and the pendant looks beautiful. I'm very pleased with it.

This is a beautiful piece. Very substantial and unusual! The only thing that would have made it better is if it had been made with a bigger bail so it could accommodate larger chains than the neckwire it comes on. Regardless, it was well worth the price

I was impressed with the quality of this pendant including the packaging!  I've received several complements on the quality and unique design.  For me it signifies John 15:5 "I am the vine and you are the branches..."

I am very pleased with this fine piece of jewelry.  Thank you

This Invicta is a great watch if you are looking for a giant size timepiece with a touch of elegance.  It is well designed and the fit and finish is good.  The Citizen automatic movement is a workhorse and very reliable.  When you open the box, this watch will impress you and everytime you wear it, it will be noticed.  It is not for the timid.  Comments and more information can be obtained through the www.invictawatchforum.com.  See what others think and general watch information

I have had this watch for two months now.  I have been working hard for these couple of months banged the watch around.  It is still scratch free.  Working outside on the car and the battery fully charged. and has stayed that way since.  Of course I was not working under the hood that day.  This watch is very bulky and although you should not work under the hood with a watch on it would be really bad.  The watch comes a full .75" above the wrist.  
The atomic part works great.  I live in Delaware and my home seems to be in a void of most radio wave, yet I get an update while I am sleeping with the watch on.  
Simply, a tough bulky watch that should not have any trouble getting the atomic time and charging the battery.  The LCD is to small to use any of the other features,  except maybe the alarm, but dont get this watch for any other features

I have two pairs of earrings from this company and they look amazing.  I can't tell if they're plastic or glass but they really do look as beautiful as in the picture, and I always get compliments when I wear them.  Sometimes people ask me what stone they are, they can't even tell it's synthetic!!  No bubbles or anything like the bad review here says

These earrings are perfect to wear every day: 

* they are comfortable to sleep in - no need to take them off in the evening

* they are small and classy - will look great with any outfit

They are exactly what I was looking for, and I'm really happy with them.

To help you see the size of these earrings and how they look on someone's ear, I've uploaded an image of this earring in my ear - see it in "Customer Images"

I am pleased with the watch. It is flashy and keeps good time.  However, I am still trying to figure out why it stops from time to time.  I think I inadvertantly push a button that stops it.  It is a small annoyance but has happened 4-5 times in the last month

I've been through generations of digital watches with plastic bands. My wife thinks they look nerdy but I like the alarm and other gadgets. I'm tired of wearing these things out though and wanted something that looked nicer. This is a very nice looking, sturdy watch which was what I wanted. It also has the window with the digital time, date, alarm, etc. My only complaint is that that window is tiny and not easy to see. Also the light for night viewing is wimpy. The watch works fine and is very nice looking but I wish the window were a bit larger. 

One year later the digital window keeps setting it self back to Jan 1 and 12:00 noon. Poor quality. Look elsewher

This is the second of these watches that I have owned.  I'm tough on watches and I had the crystal replaced on my first one but it leaked and moister got inside - still runs fine, just tough to see.  The flat crystal on this watch could be just a hair more recessed and then there would be little chance of chipping it on the edge.

This watch has an LCD that supports an alarm, its own time separate from the dial, stop watch, and date.  This combo is getting more difficult to find but is ideal for traveling and keeping the dial on home time and the LCD on local time (so alarm goes off relative to local time).  To find this in a Seiko or similar watch you will spend north of $100 and more like $200.  Getting this watch for $70 with free shipping was a no brainer.  I paid $110+tax or so for the first one five or six years ago in a department store

But no calories count.

I love this watch despite that, it's well designed, the chest strap also links to the machines in the gym (most that say POLAR ready).. so that was a great surprise

The chest strap has a battery that is user-serviceable as well as the watch, so you don't have to send it to the manufacturer (like the POLAR HR).

Overall I think is a good buy, but the is missing the calories count, that would be my only upgrade.

Are you tired of replacing watch batteries?  Do you bump into things with your watch?  If so, buy this one.  It's a beautiful, practical watch that's available at a very good price.  It winds itself mechanically as you move your wrist about.  No batteries.  It's shock- and water-resistant.  Bang it around, swim with it, wash dishes with it, shower with it.  No problem.  It's gold-plated stainless steel, with a gold-plated stainless steel band.  It's beautiful.  It's big, so if you have small wrists, buy the ladies version,  If not, buy the men's version.

The review below by "Owen Wilson" is pretty funny.  He never took it out of the box, and it stopped running, so he returned it.  LOL!  It's an automatic watch, dude!  You have to wear it to wind it, or it stops.

ANYways, I've had mine for about 4 months now and barely ever take it off.  It keeps excellent time, gaining only a second or two a day.  I really like having this wonderful piece of classic technology on my wrist, I like the size and substantial weight of it, and it's very comfortable to wear.

I took a star off the rating because the original strap developed an unpleasant odor after a couple of weeks, which no amount of scrubbing would remove.  I replaced it with an after-market Italian rubber strap.  3 months later the new strap still smells pleasantly of vanilla, which I guess is a common additive in real rubber straps.  Who knew?  The original strap looked a bit beefier and more diver-like, but the new strap has a deployment clasp which is handy.

Occasionally I wish I had bought the SKX007 instead, as I like the look of the round markers, but it hasn't bothered me much that these are square, and I prefer the second hand on this watch.  I really like the way SAT is blue and SUN is red - reminds me it's the weekend.

This is my first modern automatic and overall I'm very happy with my purchase.

The 30 reviews before mine gave pretty complete description about the watch. I'll just say it fits very well on my relatively small wrist.
If you like the watch but think it won't fit well because you have small wrist. Don't worry, it fits just fine. Enjoy.
After wearing this watch for few weeks, I realized I am just like many others, wearing the Calibre 2100 exclusively now.

Overall, the product is great.  I have had the watch for nearly three months now and have had no problems with it.  The quartz movement is very accurate, the chronograph works very well and i use the alarm every day.  The only drawback is that you have to reset the date on months that are less than 31 days.  Otherwise this watch is fantastic and with the eco-drive, you never have to worry about repacing the battery.  And the titanium version is so lightweight that you hardly notice that you are wearing a watch

I got this watch some couple of months ago and absolutely loved it. It looks,feels and functions really good and got lots of positive comments from my peeps. Now for the reason i cant get give it a 5-Star (i really wish i could); IT DOES NOT HAVE PERPETUAL CALENDER. i was looking for a watch with all of the 2100 qualities and also with perpetual calender. I hate the fact that i have to manually adjust my watch and painfull enuf, i have to leave with this flaw.

If you dont mind a watch without a perpetual calender then you would love this watch and literally bite the finger off of anyone that puts their finger on it but i want a watch with perpetual calender and this doesnt not fully cut it for me.

I have banged my watch against all kinds of hard surfaces and am pleased to say that this thing is built tough.  Everytime I've accidentally hit it against a counter top or wall, I worry that I might've scratched it, but everytime (knock on wood) it's come out clean.  Another good thing about this watch is that it's light.  For a big watch, it doesn't weigh me down like a stainless steel model.  I've gotten many compliments on it.  I love it

This watch is beautiful.  I cannot say enough good things about this watchs design.  Its 45mm face is bigger than most watches but doesnt look gawdy, it keeps perfect time and is very light weight.  I bought the Calibre 8700 before this one and I love both of them but I would give this one a slight edge.  My two small complaints are that this watch doesnt have the perpetual calender which is a very nice feature that the Calibre 8700 does have, and also that this watch uses mineral crystal for the face and not Saphire.  I am sure the crystal used is scratch resistant but it is no where near as resistant as Saphire crystal would be

This item is exactly as advertised. Well designed, well made, and heavy. My only complaint (and the reason for the 4 stars) is that the chain is way to short. I knew this when I ordered it so I had other arrangements made, but a 26" or 28" chain would be much better, in my opinion, than a 20". Great value for the money, however

This is with out a question one of Timex's Best watch. I dont know what the the band problem these other watch owners are talking about! Band has normal life span and is VERY EASY to change! Has plenty of room to get to the pins if you need to change the band. Good job Timex and Amazon!!!!!!
Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Bought 14 Fossil watches for Christmas gifts, all arrived in fine shape from Watch Zone. Of the group this was one of the nicest. Perhaps a little heavier than one would expect. Recommended

This was my first fossil watch I usually buy Burberry or D&G, but I was so hard for me to tell time on the watches so my friend told me to buy a fossil, so I did and I love it is so stylish and cute. I love the way it changes color from different angles

This is a really fun and fashionable watch.  It has a bangle style band and can be worn slightly loose or snug.  I like the pink dial that changes color.  Depending on the angle and lighting, the dial looks pink, yellow or purple.  I also like how Fossil made the band adjustable.  Remove or add as many links as necessary.  There is no need to have the watch adjusted at the jewelry counter

this watch is automatic, has a sapphire crystal and is invicta, what more can u ask? and all this for just $200.

the piece is heavy, u can taste the quality by holding it, the movement can be seen in the front and back, one of the better looking movs. iv ever seen. i own 7 automatic watches, 3 of them are invictas, but this have the coolest movement inside, it holds the charge up to 3 days and mine only losses 3 minutes in a week.

buy this watch is very very reliable.

A nice moderately priced chain that is very pretty. It is fine, delicate chain and the serpentine pattern has a spiral look to it. The are reflective areas that shimmer every 1/4 inch or so. I am using with a large cubic zirconia pendant and it is quite stunning. The chain feels strong and less likely to tangle. Great purchase for the price

As a field engineer I have to work with tools inside machinery.  More often than not I keep my watch and I have had several scratched watches in the past. So I was somewhat skeptical to wear a nice watch like this but the price seemed right to give it a try. After 9 months of using it daily, this watch has still not a single scratch. The quality is very good and it really looks better than on the picture

Due to my employment I travel extencively, this time piece has in the short time I have owned it forefilled all the requirements I require of a functional time piece at a very competetive price. I would recommend Pulsar as a manufacture to any body reqiring quality and style. At this moment in time I have 4 Pulsar time pieces that I use on a regular basis, 3 are working /daily use sports watches and I have a dress watch for when I am entertaining / partying. None of these watches have ever let me down, I have them regularly, serviced and new seals every time the batteries are changed, regular diving and swimming trips have never caused any problems. My one slight critisium would be the digital read out on this model is a little pale and could do with slightly altering the contrast, however it remains an excellent time piece - Highly recommende

I've had the watch for a week now and I'm very happy with it. Both digital and analog time are exact to the second after a week (checked against Apple network time server). The watch looks good and I can't say I've had a problem with the digital display - if it was brighter I think it would tend to be distracting. The slide rule looks good but I doubt more than 1% of buyers will actually use it. One small negative point I have noticed is that although the hands are luminous the hour markers aren't, which makes things a little tricky in complete darkness - a silly oversight, hence 4 stars. Overall though, well worth the money

I love this watch. It's perfect for swim workouts and aquathlon races -- takes splits, can do intervals, etc. I use a different product with a heartrate monitor for my runs, but can't use it for my swims (since heartrate monitors can't transmit under water, and also, the unit itself is not waterproof). This Timex has an audible chime under water, and it's easy to set the various functions. It stores your workout splits so you can recall them later when logging your workout. I also love the 3 alarms - my schedule is different every day, so I use the alarms to remind me when to leave work for school, when to leave to pick up my son, etc. I had lost my first watch (same model), but never found another watch that had all the features I wanted for a reasonable price. This is my second one!

This is the 4th or 5th watch in this series that I've owned. This one allows for multiple interval timing. Fantastic! 

I 'did' the Chicago marathon this past fall. The group that I train with runs for 3 minutes and then walks for 2 minutes on all of our training runs. This watch alternates these intervals, sounding an alarm after each! The buttons are intuitive, making it easy to use even with quite a few features.

The silver and black color combo has held up much better another black and metallic green Timex watch from another line did (The metallic green on the watch face scraped off). The band has openings which is nice (your wrist doesn't get sweaty). Good value

I've used this model watch for the past three years of my cross-country career and have thoroughly enjoyed it.  It's very light and not bulky at all - something every runner looks for in a watch.  Along with that, the interval timer really comes in handy when doing timed work outs or when  simply doing crunches.  The fit is so comfortable and does not cut or chafe.  Also, the battery life is outstanding (+ 1 year).  

Though, I have had a few issues.  I broke off the band that keeps the excess watch strap in place - though that may be my own doing from the roughness of the sports I play.  Also, I've had to return the watch for a replacement due to water damage.  Sure, it was covered by the warranty - but it's still a hassle to deal with if the problem comes up - though, I've only experienced this when steam gets into the watch or while swimming in high pressure circumstances - like when diving.  

That being said, when I lost the watch - I immediately replaced it with the same model.  If you're looking of a light, sleek, and versatile watch this will definitely do.

I ordered these earrings knowing they would be small.  If my ear holes had been a bit more toward the edge of my earlobe they might have fit.  These earrings are *really tiny* and do not fit me.  I need the next higher up size. These are like 3/8 inch, way small for me and also way difficult to even bend/manipulate to open the hoop

I ordered these earrings thinking they'd be as round as the picture seems to imply.  They're really nice but honestly, they're not as round as they look in the image, which I found a tad disappointing at first.  They're not totally flat or anything like that but the drops look a bit "flatter" in person than they do in the picture.  I'm not blaming Amazon or Silver Insanity for it since they've done nothing wrong.  Products can look different in pictures than in person due to things like light and camera angles.  I just want to give notice to people who buy these earrings.  And yes, they are a substantial piece of jewelry as the previous reviews imply, but not so big that they're distracting or gaudy or overly heavy.  They're very nice.

These are my favorite earrings: I wear them constantly. They are unique and jazz up even the most utilitarian outfit. They are a bit larger than you might anticipate,and it is a size I really like but which might overpower some. The picture, at least on my monitor, is about life-sized

For the price this watch can't be beat.  Very thin, very light, and it gets quite a few comments.  I am anxious to see how the crystal holds up as apparently Skagen is notorious for fragile crystals.  At $75, however, I won't be that upset if it has to be replaced.  Overall an excellent buy for the price and no pulling of the arm hair

I'm a picky person when it comes to watches. And I'm very rough with them. This watch has far exceeded my expectations on all accounts. Its so light I often forget I'm even wearing a watch. I've gotten several comments on it as well. The only negative thing I can say about this watch is that the mesh material of the band is difficult to get water out of. I useally take mine off to wash my hands. 

Overall its a good looking, well made, tough time piece

This was my first watch that was over $100 dollars. I was just getting into watches and wanted something that looked great and would stand the test of time. This watch is beautiful. The polished look won't last forever if worn daily, but even when battle-scarred this watch still looks classy. I love that battery replacement is pretty much a non-issue with this watch. Its titanium design makes it so light and comfortable that you might forget you are wearing it. The dial window is pretty resilient, but I would not test that too much. This is for the most part a dress watch. I also have an Invicta Abyss automatic diving watch that I wear occasionally, but I don't wear it nearly as much as I wear my Citizen.
My Citizen is my favorite watch of all time. Its versatility and longevity have impressed me in the three years that I have owned it. I recommend this watch for anyone who wants a beautiful watch that is dressy and still practical for most daily life. I always get compliments about it also. 

This watch is a good buy.

I have owned this watch for nearly 3 years now, and it has been wonderful.  It looks great, I have never had to replace the battery (according to Citizen, I never will either), and it keeps perfect time.  The clasp is very easy to operate and it fits very well.  It is definitely the lightest watch that I have ever owned.  I only have 2 gripes, one small, one could be a killing point for some people.  

The small gripe is that the crown (used to change the time/date/day) is a bit difficult to pull out to the correct position to move the date (for months with less than 31 days).  You have to pull it only halfway out (pulling it out fully will allow you to set the time), but it has a tendency to go past that to fully out or fully closed.

The larger gripe is that this watch scratches VERY easily.  I use the computer everyday for extended periods in my job.  Because of this, the bottom of the band has been scratched considerably on my desk which leaves dark grey marks on my desk and scratches on the band.  I have also scratched the metal part of the bezel just by bumping into something.  Titanium is nice and light, but probably not the best metal for a watch, especially if you plan on wearing it on a daily basis (even in an office environment)

I got the watch off Amazon for a birthday gift and I must say I'm impressed. It looked good in the picture here, and it looks even better in person! I read about the arm hair pulling problem and I don't have any problems but that's probably because I'm only 15 and I'm Asian so my arm hair isn't exactly long so I have no answer to that. My arm is only about 2.5 or so inches wide so I'm skinny needless to say, and the watch still fits me fine after removing some links. Time is accurate from what I can tell, but I had a little trouble setting the date, wouldn't turn past Thursday at first though I got it to by fowarding the time to the next day. I don't know if it's a problem or not since I haven't read the guide yet. Another thing I'm impressed by is the fact that this watch is solid titanium. Even in the middle of the links. Many cheaper watches are hollow inside the links, but not this one, it's solid titanium all the way through. As others have said, the markers really are very bright in the dark, I tested it in a completely dark room and I was able to tell the time with no trouble at all. I would recommend this watch for anyone looking for a stylish watch that's not too pricy. It's great for everyday wear so don't hesitate if you think it's too formal. If I, a 15 year old thinks it's not too formal, it probably isn't :). Hope this helps some of your decisions

Well, this is the watch band that I originally had on my Seiko watch.  I searched the internet to find a replacement.  Amazon had it for a good price.  I ordered it and got it in the mail three days later

We got these earrings for our daughter on her 6th birthday. She loves jewelry and especially earrings. The color is a little pale, the actual earrings aren't quite as pink as they look in the picture. But they are good quality and look great. My daughter wears them all the time.

This was a good buy. These earrings are great for anyday wearing or with evening wear. They look very stylish

I was more than pleased when I received this pendant! It has a nice feel and you actually know it's there, instead of it feeling like a good wind would carry it away. You have to look extremely close to see the peridot in the setting, but that is all I have to complain about! Definitely worth your money

I ordered this watch initially as a gift for someone, and when I received it, I loved the look and feel of it so much that I quickly ordered another just for myself.  It's a very sleek looking watch, very lightweight on your wrist, and the price on Amazon here is at lear 40% below what I have seen it go for regular retail price in the more upscale stores in the malls.  I intend to use this watch for special occasions as I believe it will complement dressier attire.

This watch looks incredible. The case is solid titanium and the mesh band is tiny stainless steel links infused with titanium. It really can go with anything. You could wear it with khakis, jeans, a suit, pretty much anything because the color is so versatile. If you're looking for a quality watch, that looks good, and for a really good price well look no further

I'm wearing it at the moment. it's lasted this long I don't know why people complaining about. if people wanted a nightvision face for a peice of 18th Century tech. they should just buy a Seiko. Its great for it's sole funtionality which is to look pretty in dance halls. you buy it to get stares guys; or dare I let you do this but; let your "Girlfriends" buy it for you

This is a great watch. The clasp is easy to adjust and takes only 10 minutes to adjust. It was shipped well before the estimated time and is in perfect condition. Well made and light, it's extremely slim. SO if you really like heavy watches, this may not be your choice. Otherwise it is perfect for everyone

this is the best watch if you consider following things: 
1. Looks: the color of dial and the feeling of dial on hands is really beautiful. 
2. Size and thickness: If you search for slim watches, skagen will be your first and final choice. 
3. Mesh Band: This type of band is the speciality of skagen. its un-comparable. 
4. Price: Considering the price for overall quality this watch is really affordable.

Bottom Line: Everyone will notice and appreciate about it.

I was searching for a watch for weeks, saw a picture of this watch and paused. Intrigued  I began to read the specs: alarm, chronograph, thermometer, light, stopwatch, world-time zones and more, what's the catch? $55USD C'mon seriously with all those features is that all? I was still skeptical but when I got the watch & put it on my wrist I was sold. Solid, well crafted, unique sporty/elegant combination. My only gripe is that slight increase in body temperature can give an innacurate room temperature. We can't have the world but CASIO has come close with this price I can honestly say go for it

this watch has it all at a nice price, the display is kind of dark and the band sacrifices some of your hand-hair if u have and i doubt that u don't have, else is a masterpiece, all stainless steel, even base, thermomener and a smart cronograph, plus 3 yrs battery, this is my favourite, no other watch has this price/quality proportion. try it and u will be satisfied, sporty but looks elegant too

I love the look but was a little unhappy with the quality of the small melee diamonds used around the dial of the watch.  They are very milky and personally, I think the watch would look better without them at all if that's the only quality they had.  
Great looking and I'm glad I finally bought it for myself.

I had been looking at this particular watch for over a year and simply did not want to spend the money on it.  I found it at Amazon.com for half the price I had seen in department stores so I decided to buy it.  It is a fabulous watch.  I look forward to wearing it each day.  It looks great with really dressy suits or jeans and a top.  It is a great piece.

I purchased this Bulova watch as a Christmans gift for myself, this past christmas '06. I have a small watch collection & I hadn't really bought such an elegant watch before, so I decided why not? Specially when I researched the price on how much I would save by buying it on Amazon.  By looking at the pics on Amazon it looked so nice, but when I received it  was the most BEAUTIFUL watch I had seen or owned. The diamond bezel is just right it isn't to much glitz nor is it too little, the diamonds are just right & amazing they sparkle so beautifully against the chronograph face & the stainless steel band. The watch itself is a little heavy compared to other watches I own so it is definitely sturdy & above all just a well made timepiece that I am sure will be, not just in my collection but on my wrist for years to come.

I rec'd this today.  I had been looking for a while for a white faced stainless watch and kept coming back to this one from Bulova. (I looked for nearly two years!)  I did some looking around online and in stores and Amazon by far had the best price (they beat everyone by at least $100), so I did what any girl would do, I bought it.  

It is a substantial watch. It's not a watch for someone looking for something dainty or unassuming. I don't think it's heavy, it just feels like you've got a watch on.  I personally like the size and weight.  I plan on this being my spring/summer watch until it dies or something happens to it.  I have a Seiko Coutura with a black MOP face w/diamonds that I love, but I wanted something different but sort of the same and this one was it.

These earrings are very pretty; I'm very pleased! Nice faceting and sparkle. The stones are a medium/bright green with a little yellow and brown mixed in, which only seem to make the stones more intriguing and beautiful. The peridot stones in these earrings are the prettiest I've owned so far. Highly recommend

They sparkle well and look as good as anything else I have seen at the mall stores.  I like the non-cup style studs, as I think they allow more light to flow through the stone.  Save your cash and get these.  She will be very happy and you can spend the extra money on fishing lures or something.  ;-)

DO NOT go to Jared's jewelers if they are near you...they are evil people.

As soon as I saw this watch I had to get it.  I loved it because it had really nice details and the butterflies are beautiful.  It's a really nice looking and good quality watch.  The only problem I do have with it is that the face is quite big.  If you have a small wrist it is very large.  I still love it and would never return it but feel like it could be a lot smaller.

I just got this watch as a Christmas present.  It is gorgeous.  The only thing is it's a little bigger than I would like it to be.  The face is so femanine, but the size makes it a little masculine.  The face is about an inch and a half in diameter, and the band is a little over a half inch wide.

Because it is SO pretty I am keeping it, however if you prefer a small dainty watch, maybe this one isn't for you.  My friends are telling me bigger watches are "in" now so maybe they're right??

This is my second Skagen watch. My first one, which was almost identical to my new one, lasted ten years of daily use. I love the two-tone combination of gold and stainless steel. My only disappointment is that, at a glance, it is difficult to tell the minute hand from the second hand. I think the hour and minute hands should be slightly more heavier than the second hand. Otherwise, I love the profile design of this watch including where the comfortable mesh band meets the watch face

- Not too good for a small hand. Though it is possible to adjust the bracelet to different sizes, on a small hand there will be a long part of the band left (under the "top layer"). It is difficult to make this part invisible, as it tends to come from one of the sides.
- The clasp is tight. Hope it will be easier to open and close after some usage.
- The combination of the brushed metal dial and the golden hands makes it difficult to read, especially in dim light.
- The golden "piece" is actually just a thin film layer on the inner side of the glass.

I'm delighted with my Skagen watch as I was with the previous one I lost.  I find the clean, modern design makes me feel elegantly turned out.  The analog dial is easy to read.  The mesh band is easy to adjust to my wrist size.  The silver color coordinates with my silver jewelry

This bracelet is very simple and elegant. The pav cz has a great sparkle, but isn't overboard. I also like the fact that it's a rolo bracelet--the links are delicate and small, but very sturdy and have a nice gleam to them. Furthermore, the charm "O" is a nice style and doesn't look gaudy. There are some tiny little dots on the back of the charm (not so sure what those are all about).

This bracelet looks great stacked on top of my silver bracelet watch. Wearing any bracelet can make it hard to type, but this one is cool because you can actually peg it nice and tight to your wrist by wrapping the "stick" part of the clasp beneath the rolo chain if you want it out of the way. 

I get compliments every time I wear this bracelet; so, it's nice that it supports a good cause since it does get noticed. Obviously, if you're looking for fine jewelry, this might not be your choice, but as they say, "Diamonds are forever, but CZ is for right now." ;-)

I would recommend this for those in their teens, but even for women in their twenties and thirties who like the whole sterling-silver bling-thing. Also, definitely recommended for those interested in supporting good causes such as ovarian cancer awareness.

I selected this stopwatch from the many others simply because it has the indiglo feature, and I need to operate in subdued lighting.
Other advertised features are similar to many other stopwatches. 
In use, I have found it to be quite satisfactory. The readout is clear and large enough to be read at a glance. I have not had the need to explore all of the features, but it does all that I would like it to do quite well. There is a short learning curve, but not insurmountable.
If night vision is an issue, this is the only one.... if night vision may be a requirement in the future, it is still the only one. Otherwise, it performs at least equally as well as any others available.

I love the grand central stone as well as the modern multi-strands of this design - this combination truly illuminates my evening wear.  By far, the intricate detail present reminds me of the jewelery owned by ladies of the royal court.  With so much class it is still affordable.  This necklace is an exceptional gem.

I am pleased with the watch.  It syncs with the big clock in Colorado every morning at midnight.  We also have a wall clock at home which does the same thing and the difference between the 2 is no more the 1 second at worst.  For $40 you can't go wrong.  Only complaint is my wrist is in between removing 1 or 2 links from the watch band so I chose 1.  It rides a tad lose on my wrist but 2 links would make it too tight.  Guess I need to lose a couple more pounds so I can take another link out!

I came across this watch on a Friday sale at well over half off, a great price. The features were more than adequate for telling time; dead on accuracy, plus date and day. I figured setting the watch couldn't be too difficult, there are only two buttons, so I purchased it with a gift card, totally painless.

The watch arrived a few days later and I had it programmed easily within 5 or 10 minutes. The watch band is pretty long so I had to remove a link from each side to fit, no special tools are needed. While traveling, setting the time zones is easy as city codes around the world are listed on the back. The wave ceptor function works fine in Boston and in Europe.

I usually wear more expensive watches than this, but this one looks great,  much better than in the picture. The specs say it has a metal case, but it doesn't. It has resin buttons, case, and back, but with some metal cladding. The band is all metal

This is probably one of Casio's least expensive Wave Ceptors. It synchs every day indoors in a watch case that's not by a window. The digital display shows the day, date, and other info such as which time zone, what time it synched. I'm just concerned that the analog, digital display, and receiving every day will make it a battery eater. It's available in different dials, but the blue seems to be the most common. I give it 4 stars because the luminous paint is not very bright. And the crystal is acrylic-scratches easily. But that's not really an issue because I have about 15 watches, and this one gets very little wrist time

Overall, this watch is good: 
  large numbers
  fairly standard set of basic features (date, alarm, stop watch)
  crown seems fairly resistant to scratching
  Indiglo lighting is great

Contrary to the description, however, the chronograph does NOT have a lap capability; it only has a split function (2 way).

As a reminder, it does not have a countdown timer, which seems to be a common theme for many Timex watches

I ordered one of these for the time I spend in the gym and on the track running, also it is a good choice if you go swimming every once in a while.

Of course, for that price you are not getting a professional sports watch like the Omega's Seasmaster, but for occasional use it's just great. It has all you need - stop watch, alarm, the nice light that Timex calls Indiglo, etc. It also comes with a black plastic strap that feels good and unlike leather is really "water-friendly". Anyway, who needs a 50m water-resistant watch if the strap can "survive" nothing more than a splash of water.

As far as accuracy - so far it's OK. I had it for 4 months now and I had to adjust it only once -- it was 2 seconds behind.

It doesn't have the fancy functions that you would find in the Casio's G-Shock series, like address book that stores 50 names and numbers or a sophisticated stop-wtach that can split times or measure per lap time, nor it has an altimeter, but then again you can get it for less then $20.

Overall, I give this nice Timex 5 stars - it's a great value watch for occasional use

Swarovski has been making crystal jewelry since 1892, and their consistent quality has kept the company going through wars and the rise and fall of empires. These excellent earrings are made of sterling silver and Swarovski crystals, and are quite attractive. If you are looking for some nice, crystal and silver earrings, then these are the ones to get. 

By the way, they look great when combined with the Heart, Star and Starburst crystal tattoos - which I also highly recommend!

Let's face it, it's hard to find a watch that has it all: a nice band, a decent color scheme, an elegant but not overbearing look.  This has it.  I'm sure some will say that the animation is too much, but it's very subtle, and it can be stopped at the tough of a button.   The crystal is not too large, and  not too small, and the band is tough

Bought this to use at work since I had to send in the one I usually wear for repairs. Lumi is extremely bright when charged. The Monster has gained 1 minute in 2 days which is not bad for an inexpensive Seiko. Swapped the band with a NATO, fits a little bit better on my wrist. Overall a good purchase

These earrings are the beautiful deep blue of genuine sapphires and the 1.0 carat size is just the right size (anything larger might tend to look "fake".

I've purchased from this merchant many, MANY times and always find myself typing in *Sabrina Silver* whenever I need or want a new and inexpensive piece of jewelry...they're the best and I've never been disappointed.

Got this at Amazon for a great price. The design is by Edwatd Mirell whose collection of mens's jewelry is unrivaled (sp?). This bracelet sells at Michaels Jewelers at the Mall for $100.00 I'm getting some of his other designs here at Amazon. You won't regret it. It's an elegant but masculine bracelet. Happy Holiday's.

You know how usual it is to see people wearing the tiffany love charmbracelet? This looks exactly like one of those, with a twist. It look more like tiffany bracelet with follie follie charms and its a watch. At a price like that, it's a steal! However, the bracelet is a little too long for my wrist. What's more interesting is that the box of the watch works as a clock itself. How practical can that be. If you are looking for a chrambracelet, this it is

These earrings are very pretty. They are a nice size and they aren't heavy at all, very lightweight. I have had them for a week or so now and have gotten nothing but compliments on them. They are great and so is the price! The vendor sent them very promptly and there were no problems.

I love knowing the exact time (even if my mom thinks I am crazy), and it works like a... clock! I never have issues with the updates (in Illinois), but I do have a few minor issues: the watch is too thick (5/8 inch), the band is made for a gorilla and is very difficult to adjust for a human, the buttons are hard to press, and the manual is too small and hard to read. Still, if I had a choice between this watch or my borhter's Rolex, I will take his Rolex and exchange it for 40 Casios. Thank you, Casio

I've owned several watches, including the older G-Shock and the Casio Men's G-Shock Atomic Solar Watch # GW1400DA-9AV (among others).

First, there are so many G-shock models to choose from. You could have bought the # GW1400DA-9AV (the stainless steel model) for the same price ($75) during the week of July 24, 2006.

This watch simply has everything one ever needs for time functionality: solar power (no need for daily rewinding, kinetic body movement, or batteries), synch with the atomic clock in Colorado (ultimate accuracy), time zone adjustment (ease for jet setters), light button (which also goes off when you tilt your wrist), stop watch functionalities, day/date functionalities, and countless other time-related functions. In this respect, it's much more functional than a Patek (even the complicated wrist watch models, or the more mundane Rolex, etc.). Of course, it's a lowly Casio, costing a mere $75 (vs. $75,000 for a low end complicated Patek)

Buyers should be aware that the watch is purtty bulky, probably 5/8 to 3/4 in. thick. One needs a sporty forearm/wrist to go with this watch.

For the fun of wearing it couple times a year, the price, and just to look at it as part of a collection of watches, I'd highly recommend it.

I live in eastern Pennsylvania, about 1600 - 1700 miles away from the atomic time signal station and this watch syncs fine right on my bureau, 4 feet from a window, and in a watch case.
When I received the watch, the battery indicator was on Medium, after about 30 minutes or less on a sunny windowsill, it achieved Full charge.
I'm quite pleased with it

I insisted that the watch be one with hands, not digital.  So we all were happy and satisfied!  Ina Lan

I wear this watch every day and I usually work outside. I am very pleased with the features and the durability. It seemed daunting to work the features at forst, but a short time with the instruction book made them accessable and easy.

I have only two complaints: One is that the metal band has developed a slight "squeak" when I move my wrist sometimes. The tin man needs oil. The second is that despite being placed by a huge window every night, the watch does not always get the time signal from Ft. Collins. I have gone as long as several days without getting it - but when you consider that most watches do not get it at all, I am OK with the spotty reception

The watch is solar powered and time is synchronized with an Atomic clock.  I'm not sure how that works (radio waves?) but the watch is extremely accurate.  The watch charges easily - put it under a light when you take it off- and it has a powersaving feature that kicks in when there is no light source (i.e. it's dark).  The buttons/settings work similarly to a battery powered G-shock but there is a little more complexity because you have to set your home city for the atomic clock sync to work right.  It's the first Casio I've owned with a metal band.  Unless you're a gorilla, You'll need to remove some links from the watch band.  I did this myself but you may want to take it to a jewelry store cause they have the right tools.  I love the watch.  It is everything you would expect from a G-Shock

You'll most likely have to get the links adjusted
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
The strap/links on these G-Shocks are quite oversized: when I first got it, I could fit the watch around my legs! (You'll most likely have to get the links adjusted). Ironically, the four side buttons on the watch is small. So even if you have a huge wrist, you'll probably have trouble pressing the buttons! (Not for huge fingers) 

***BEWARE*** the picture shows the four side buttons on the watch in silver, but the left and right side buttons on this model is actually plain black! It is quite misleading! The silver side button is actually the MTG920DJ model (which is the 2005 version). According to Casio, the MTG920DA was actually released in 2004 with black side buttons. If you search the Casio website, it will only display the MTG920DJ (their most recent version); most websites that still sell the MTG920DA are just taking the latest MTG920DJ version picture from Casio's website. The MTG920DJ seems to have the same features as this one (MTG920DA), except the four side (left and right) buttons are in silver. 

For those of you wondering about the three circles on the watch: 
the first one on the very left is basically a wannabe-analog display - basically, every five minutes, a bar increases (or decreases when it gets full); it's just mostly there for cosmetic reasons. 

The second one in the middle is the battery status; it has an L (Low), M (Medium), and H (High) and the bar would display in one of those areas. If you get out in the sun a lot or know an area in your home where the sun shines a lot, then you won't have a problem with the battery ever going below High. Moreover, it has a power saving feature; the watch will go into sleep mode (display off) when it is in a completely dark area for a long time. 

Finally, the third circle on the very right is where it tells you what options are enabled/disabled. It shows SPL (split time for stopwatch), DST (Daylight Saving Time), SIG (Hourly Signal), ALM (Alarm), SNZ (Snooze), and Auto EL (Automatic Electro-Luminescent backlight - the backlight turns on by tilting it a certain degree towards your face without having to manually press the backlight button.) 

Keep in mind, synchronizing with the atomic signal is not instant: it usually takes around 3 minutes (at least for me, I live in California.) And if you're in a busy area or near an electronic, it might be difficult; try again or move to a different area. Moreover, it should show you the strength/level (4 levels) of the signal (while you're synchronizing) with a satellite icon on the watch. There is also a feature that automatically synchornizes for you while you're sleeping at 2:00AM, 3:00AM, 4:00AM, and 5:00AM. Therefore, it's not always necessary to syncronize it yourself because by the time you wake up, it should be ready to go. 

Overall, this watch is attractive and fun to wear. The atomic radio signal feature is very cool; having the official time is great - right to the precise second! I've had this watch for months now, and I enjoy wearing it daily. 

This watch does have a lot of feature - except, it's a pity it does ***NOT*** have a countdown timer! 

Pros: 
- Cool design 
- Water/scratch resistant; G-Shock are known for their toughest watches. (Update: I've worn this watch daily for almost a year and a half now and not a single scratch - still looks brand new!)
- Solar Power; battery life is excellent; never had the power ever go below High. Power Saving Feature. 
- Position of the time and date is easy to read at one glance. 
- Metal strap 
- Can display World Time with Local Time 

Cons: 
- The side buttons are small and tight to press (must use like the very tip of the fingers) 
- Atomic signal takes too long manually, and it usually is not possible to synchronize while wearing the watch; if you're inside the home, it is usually best to take off the watch and leave it near a window. 
- Alarm beep can be a little longer perhaps (even my inexpensive Timex Watch would beep and it would gradually beep faster, which I actually like a bit better.) 
- No countdown timer. (How could they forget this?!) 

Also, try to research other models instead of finding out the hard way (like I did about the side buttons) before purchasing.

These are great everyday earrings and you will not be disappointed if you buy them.  This is not a negative - just a caution; the earrings are pretty heavy and if you have elongated holes in your ears, these may weigh them down.

I was struggling to find the perfect Father's Day gift for my picky husband. Fossil is a reliable product/brand and I , myself own a Fossil watch. The style of the watch is great because my husband can go from office, to yardwork, to golfing, to a night out without ever changing his watch! He absolutely loves his watch!

When I ordered these, I was a little nervous.  However, once I recieved them I was rather impressed!  These are perfect for small ears and I love how the backs of the earrings are screw-ons and they do not dig into the ear or behind the ear (which is a problem I run into with my daughter who is 5).  She loves these earrings!  The picture on Amazon is horrible, these are quite pretty and nice.  I would definately order more!

This was a pity gift to myself because it was my anniversary, and I've just had nose surgery.  Like other reviewers, I was also surprised at the quality of these earrings.  I try to look for bargains on Amazon to make my shopping dollars go as far as possible, and these seemed to be a good deal at $24.99 when regular price was $75.  Just since March 16, though, both retail and selling prices have changed on Amazon to be $34.99 and $70.  It's very true that the posts are a little thicker than normal, but not onerously so; the result is that the hoop is not going to slide around on your ear, and the post clicks securely into the catch on the other side.  The earrings are larger than I expected for the price, which is good, but they are not too big.  Nickel size is about right, and they feel as if they have some weight to them

I think the title says it all!  The posts are fine and I don't feel that they are too thick at all.  These earrings are comfortable and elegant.  In response to the two negative reviews based on the size of the hoops, I would recommend that all intelligent buyers READ the dimensions in order to avoid disappointment.  I can't believe that people would negatively rate an item because they were ignorant and failed to read the description.  The description is very accurate and I am very happy with these earrings.  You won't be disappointed with the quality of these earrings

I bought these to replace my boyfriend's favorite earrings (he lost one).  I had to return them because they were a little bigger than the one's he had and they looked a bit "metro".  Overall, though, they were of excellent quality and I wish it had worked out

I ordered this necklace for my 6 year-old daughter who misses me at school. I told her to touch the necklace whenever she felt lonely as it will remind her of my love :-) It is a high-quality necklace. It is tailored (in size and scale) for girls but it reminds me of some of my own jewelry in terms of design and finish. This line would make a great "first" Real necklace for your blossoming young lady

Just keep in mind it's mainly only used for getting the pins out to the point where you can work with them using a good set of pliers. Saved me quite a bit of time and money spent going to a jeweler for sizing several watches as I gain and lose weight. Has worked every time for me...

As the last reviewer said, look for directional arrows on the band showing which way the pins should travel, both on the way out and on the way in.

The maximum band width that will fit in the tool is 15/16". People have complained about the limitation, but haven't posted exactly how wide a band this tool will work with. If you're handy, this plastic tool could be cut or ground to accept wider bands.

Do a search for a place called Widget Supply that sells this tool for a little less and also includes 5 extra pins. They shipped mine very quickly

I loved this item because for less than the price of getting one link taken out of one of my watches i could take out as many as i wanted from all of my watches and save so much more money on doing a simple task. I think anyone who is wanting to remove links from their watch should invest in this product before they go to a jewelers and pay to have it done

The link remover worked as advertised. It took approximately 10 minutes to remove links and put band back together on a Fossil watch. Care needs to be taken to make sure you have aligned the pin with the bracelet properly. Don't try to force it. When you have it aligned properly you'll see the pin slide out

This is a hefty watch, large super polished bracelet. The dial is brilliant red. I can see why one reviewer complained over finger-prints. lol
My only discerns were: Does not say who makes movement. The crown is difficult to use. Be careful when sizing as pin is a split spring. Changing time requires sweep hand be at the 12:00 position. Seems to keep good time. It is gorgeous. 10 year warranty has a $10.00 catch

My 15 year old daughter has spent the last four months in and out of the hospital and treatment programs for depression and self-injury. When I first saw it, I knew it was the perfect gift to give her for Christmas.  She has made some wonderful progress and this bracelet will be a very visible reminder of what's important and true.

Bought 14 Fossil watches for Christmas gifts, all arrived in fine shape from Watch Zone. Of the group this was one of the nicest. Recommended

Atomic watches are highly-accurate quartz watches which are synchronized each day with a time signal broadcast in the U.S. from the definitive U.S. Atomic Clock in Ft. Collins, Colorado. Thus, all atomic watches are always accurate to within a fraction of a second at any time. Since atomic watches adjust automaticaly to and from daylight saving time they are convenient as well as highly accurate. Casio makes -- and Amazon sells -- a wide selection of styles of atomic watches to suit various needs and tastes, including G-Shock watches for extra ruggedness and solar-powered watches which never need replacement batteries. But all atomic watches, including this budget-priced Waveceptor model, are equally accurate to a fraction of a second at all times. If you want an attractive watch that is always accurate and do not need other special features, this model is a real bargain

I was looking for a money clip that was thin and light.  I wanted a hinge so that I didn't have to bend it every time the thickness of my wad of cash changed by a significant percentage.  I dislike gaudiness as much as cheesy or cheap appearance.  

This money clip meets and exceeds all I asked for, except it looks a bit on the cheap, as others have commented.  It also scratches easily, but I knew about this prior to purchase decision since I've owned other titanium products.  

I would have given this a solid 5 stars if the manufacturer made it wider using a thicker material and rounded the corners evenly, but I'm not sure if I would have paid a higher price.  

For those of you who are using your finger nails to open the hinge, I recommend that you hold on to the bills to open the hinge.  You will have leverage to open it easily without risking a cut.  Yes, it's that sharp.

I bought this as a gift for my fiance.  He hates bulky things in his front pockets, but this is something he can use and forgets it's there.  He left it in his pocket and it went through the wash.  Everything he had clipped in it, credit cards and cash, were all still clipped together after a full wash cycle

Several years ago, I was given one of those so-called front pocket wallets as a gift.  It had a clip with the exact same mechanism as this clip riveted to it.  I loved the clip, didn't like the wallet. Too bulky for my front pocket.  So I ripped the clip off the wallet. I loved that clip until it broke after about 4 years of everyday use.

Anyway, in searching for a replacement I found that I could spend around 20 bucks for another front pocket wallet and rip the clip off of it again or I could spend around 20 bucks for this clip.

I love this clip. 
Its extremely lightweight, strong and durable. It keeps my cash neatly organized and doesn't pull my pants down.
My only complaint is that the corners are a tad pointy.  The manufacturer would do well to soften them a bit

I purchased these earrings and can't find anything bigger to compare them to for the price. The backs stay on great and will not get caught on carpet/blankets that could catch and pull the backs off. I have bought several pairs and nothing compares. I would recommend these earrings for any young child

I purchased these earrings as a first birthday gift for my daughter. We printed out the page and went to the local Fred Meyer Jewelers in the mall to see the earrings first hand before we purchased. We absolutely LOVED the earrings, however they were full price, so decided to save $80 and purchase them online. They arrived within two days of ordering, but when we opened the box, the diamonds were yellow, not clear and sparkly as pictured on the site, or at the mall. Still lovely, and a good price, but I think thast these are seconds or lower quality than the earrings one can purchase at the physical store

I'm one of those people that doesn't like to have to rack my brain to figure out what time it is and so I pride myself on buying digital watches.  This watch is great is you're going for a sleek design combined with a trendy look. Plus, this particular combination isn't one that is seen often so you'll be sure to be a one of a kind. I get compliments all the time on how much people like my watch

It was the only friendship ying yang necklace I could find anywhere.  It was perfect, exactly what I envisioned.  Fast shipping.  Shipping was a bit expensive, though, considering the price of the item, but because the item itself was reasonably priced, I got over it.  The other problem I had with shipping, and I don't know if it was the merchant, or Amazon, is that it indicated that the number of days for standard shipping would get it to me well before Christmas, but when I clicked on standard shipping it gave me a notice that I WOULDN'T get it before Christmas and I HAD to choose expedited in order to get it by Christmas.  That did not make me happy.

The necklace is not coloured (i.e. black/white), but aged(yin) and smooth(yang). I would have liked it to be coloured, as this is what is displayed. If this is not what you get, I suggest the picture be updated. However, other than this I was overall satisfied and will cosider ordering other items. The price was extremely satisfying, considering the time and effort I put forth trying to find a pendant like this one. Next time I will make it a point to find out more about the product before I order

These little earrings were exactly what I wanted for work (to wear with scrubs and not look gaudy). They are small, but have a nice width, so they are very shiny. I also like the snap-bar closure. They'd make a nice gift for a pre-teen as they are simple but elegant and the snap bar closure makes them easy to put in with little chance of loss

I bought this for my 5 year old grandaughter in memory of her dad who was killed in Iraq. She loved it. The locket is perfect for a young girl, however,the chain that came with it is very fine and difficult to fasten.  I bought a sturdier chain to go with this locket. I am very pleased with this purchase

I purchased this item as a gift for a friend who collects pigs.  When it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised.  The item is so much nicer than the picture depicted.  And my friend loved it.  The rhinestones in the ears are such a nice touch!  Anyone with a pig collection really needs this item

I have read a few complaints about these earrings, but I bought them for my mother for Christmas and they were of very good quality. They arrived very well packaged and came with a nice navy blue velvet box. Along with another box to match it to put that in

I got these on sale through Amazon, but even if I were paying Amazon's full price, I would be very happy with the purchase. A great deal for 14kt!  The earrings are just what I wanted, and are quality-made.  That in itself would be nice, but they come in a velvet box that is nestled inside a nice black slip-top box.  The presentation is so great that now I'm thinking of buying my mom some jewelry from Amazon

I am very pleased with this pendant.  The only flaw would be that the individual rings are not attached together.  The chain is looped around them all, which I thought was a little odd.  But I do like it very much and it is a good value for a great price!

I own several waveceptor watches, and it is easy to get addicted to the "to the second all the time" accuracy of these watches. I like the looks of this one, being somewhat more elegant and less geeky than most of the other models. It works as advertized and is an excellent value. About the only thing preventing a 5 star rating is that the band is a bit thick and tough... i.e. not pliable. I hope this means it will also be more long lasting, but time only will tell

Got this for Christmas, for a son who's growing so fast his wrists haven't caught up with his height yet.  Every watch without a buckle just falls off his hands, so the strap was a high priority.  This Casio has an actual leather band (doesn't pinch, doesn't stick, doesn't look tacky) with a very sturdy buckle.  It is also incredibly sturdy and well made, with a dignified stainless steel bezel.  My other priority was to find a self-setting watch with an attractive dial; this one is clear, clean, easy to read, beautifully executed and GLOWS IN THE DARK (all the blue back-lighting in the world won't replace that amazing look of pale, phosphorescent watch hands floating in the darkness).  
***Bonus--don't miss watching the hands spin when it sets itself for the first time.  Absolutely captivated my son--he loves this thing!!

This pendant is very well crafted, and there is an incredible amount of detail that is only hinted at in the image shown here. It's lightweight and the perfect size: big enough to get noticed, but not so large that it's distracting.

The phoenix is the symbol of rebirth and freedom. If you're starting a new career, getting over a bad relationship, moving to a new place...this is the perfect way to celebrate your new path

This product was great.  Exactly what I envisioned.  Fast shipping.  Shipping was a bit expensive, though, considering the price of the item, but because the item itself was reasonably priced, I got over it.  The other problem I had with shipping, and I don't know if it was the merchant, or Amazon, is that it indicated that the number of days for standard shipping would get it to me well before Christmas, but when I clicked on standard shipping it gave me a notice that I WOULDN'T get it before Christmas and I HAD to choose expedited in order to get it by Christmas.  That did not make me happy.

I bought this to go with a silver pendant that I also purchased for my wife for Christmas and she loves the silk cord. My wife loves the way the silk cord feels against her skin. Highly recommended.

These earring are perfect! The hoops are the perfect size; big enough to be seen, but not TOO big. They are great to wear with a pair of jeans or a business suit. I wear them every single day

I love these earrings.  They are really beautiful and so shiny that even with my long hair they're noticable.  

If you're interested in the size of the earrings, I would say that they're about the size of a quarter.  Someone mentioned thick posts.  The posts are the thickest I have seen but I like them.  Every other pair of earrings I own have bent posts because I forget to remove them before going to sleep.  Not these.  

The price is fantastic and they come in a nice box.  Perfect affordable gift

I bought this for myself- as a visible reminder while I waited for surgery. Putting it on helped even more during recovery.

It is just the right size- not too heavy, not too thin. Everyone wants a closer look when I have it on.

I recieved this watch as a gift several months ago. The watch is very nice looking, much better looking in person. Mine hasn't had any issues with timekeeping, it's been very accurate. I haven't experienced the problems others have. 

The face of the watch is nearly impossible to scratch. There's been several times where I've accidently rubbed the face against a wall or other surface only to find no damage, much to my surprise. Other watches I've had scratch within the first week. I've had this watch for about 6 months and have no face scratches (although around the face and on the band show many scratches, not nearly as annoying as a scratch right on the face). I'm serious, I like to party and the face is still scratchless. This is very surprising to me.

The chronograph functions are almost entirely useless, but who cares. A stopwatch without fractions of a second is not worth using, but with this watch the features are more for looks, and they look great. I don't find this to be a big deal since I would rather not have digital functions on my watch, they look tacky in my opinion. Also my cell phone has a great stop watch funtion which I use for 12 ounce beer chug time trials making this complaint almost inconsiquential.

The movement of the watch leaves a little to be desired. The japaneese movement is somewhat jumpy. At this price you really can't expect an automatic movement however. This is really the biggest weak point of the watch and if you have a bunch of cash burning a hole in your pocket, maybe you should get a swiss automatic movement watch. This is a somewhat minor issue given almost all watches in this price range use japanees movements no normal person will ever know the difference.

This watch is about the same price as a cheap fossil watch but when you see it in person it feels and looks much more expensive. The fit and finish is much more than you would expect for $115. I find it to be a great value. The box it comes in is so nice you don't want to throw it away, I still have mine. I wear this watch every day I still recieve compliments on it

This is a great looking watch.  It feels solid and works very well.  I have found it to be more than adequate in its accuracy.  

I fully understand that this is not an "investment timepiece" but for now it is around $100, and looks and feels great.  

I strongly recommend this watch

My Invicta Speedway Chronograph S Watch arrived Friday, several days before I anticipated its delivery and, though not highly relevant, I was impressed with the way it had been packed.

I like the watch very much. The bracelet fitted perfectly and the watch took minimal set up time. I read the manual and everything works as I expected it to.

The luminous hands have a lot more glow than previous watches I've owned and the watch looks expensive... which is precisely why I bought it!

It's a bargain at Amazon's $120 price

This watch is a very nice timepiece.  The only disappointing thing is that Amazon is selling a watch that they know nothing about.  The watch has a Japanese Chronograph movement, not a swiss-quartz.  And the band does not come with a double-locking deployment buckle like it says, it comes with a double-locking diver buckle.  Overall I am pleased with the watch.  I just hope Amazon can advertise their products a little bit better

These are great! I bought the black one with the lightening bolts for my 6 yr old. I think he wore it for more than a year constantly except to take a bath and for swim class (including at night). The battery died after a little more than a year. Unfortunately, to replace the battery with a water tight seal cost $25. I told him we'd buy a new watch. He chose the spaceship one... then he didn't wear it for 6 months. The other one is still in his drawer. He just started wearing it again... he loves it! I WILL buy one for my second son... probably the green one with the frogs

I bought this as my everyday watch and love it!  I'm very happy with the ultrathin band that lays down nicely on my wrist and doesn't catch at my arm hairs like chain links do.  The only complaint, and this is a very minor one, is that the adjustable band wasn't made for someone who's wrist is as thin as mine- 5.5 inches around.  I think the tightest it'll go is 6 inches.

So far this watch has been accurate with the moon phase. It is very easy to operate and understand. I have only been out a couple of times to fish and it was at times that the watch indicated that the fishing would not be so good and it wasn't, so this feature has been accurate as well. It is also a coll conversation peice

My boyfriend had an older model of this watch that he wore for work and play for years.  He wore it while fighting forest fires and fishing in the PNW, and it held up great.  I bought this watch for him as a Christmas gift, and he loved it.  It looks great, is comfotable and was reasonably priced.  Hopefully it has the lasting power of his previous one

This watch is great!  Not only does it have distinct features for helping kids learn to tell time, but it also has fun features that they enjoy.  For instance, there is a backlight on this watch that my son likes to play with in the dark.  Also, it fits the smallest wrists.  With this watch, my son learned to tell time in one day.  It has not come off of his wrist since we bought it.  He even wears it in the tub and yes, it is waterproof

This is a great watch--just a "watch." Doesn't beep, chirp, talk to me, or have diamonds in it.  I can use it everywhere; the indiglow feature is wonderful.  Great watch

Skagen makes this watch very thin and lightweight with an unbeatable affordable price for titanium watches.  The watch is only categorized as a fashion watch because it looks good for its price.  The quality of the clasp is terrible.  I bought this watch for my boyfriend for vday and he said that the clasp keeps on popping off easily.  He does like the watch besides of that factor cause it is light and great for a everyday beater watch

My son bought this for me for my birthday. I love it!! Like so many others have said, if your tired of those bulky boat anchors you'll love this watch. It's so light you'll have to double check to see if you have put it on. It doesn't have all the " bling bling " you see in a lot of watches which is a good thing for me yet it's still very elegant looking. Thin, light weight,nice looking and keeps great time. I can't say enough good things about this great watch. Buy one....you won't be disappointed

I had a 6 yr old Skagen that broke down last year. Since then, I was looking for a price worthy watch. Forutunately, I found something I was looking for at amazon.com. Great watch at an awesome price. I love my new Skagen.

I wanted I watch that I could forget I was wearing.  This watch fits the bill.  It is very very light weight, and the band is comfortable.  I've had multiple watches over the course of my life, but this is one that I will put on at the start of the day and only take off at the end of the day, comfortable and light.

It also looks great.  Sophisticated looking, and can be worn in both casual and dress events.  Great everyday watch!  Highly recommended

I have had mine for two days now.  It is what I expected: A lightweight, minimalist, stylish watch.

Mine is quiet, I can hear it ticking only when held tight to my ear.  The clasp takes some getting used to and the instruction could be clearer, but once one gets it figured out it works fine, including adjusting it.  It is somewhat difficult to read in low light, but the hands while small are very reflective so changing the viewing angle a bit will usually bring them into clear view.

After reading several reviews for this watch I have to disagree with the comments about loud ticking noise and the strap not latching. I don't have either of these issues.  The watch is however very difficult to read in dim lighting.
The watch is really unexceptional - it offers good styling at a moderate price and that's about it

Every review I read about this watch is true: it's light, stylish, has a loud ticking noise when off the wrist and can be hard to read in certain lighting.
But overall, I am very pleased with the watch and so is its wearer

I agree with most of the other posters here on the watch's aesthetics-it's a really sleek watch that goes well with casual or more formal clothing.

I'm writing a review mainly to address the "loud clicking" that some people seem to be experiencing.

It's a REALLY quiet watch and I can't hear it in a totally quiet room-EXCEPT when I hold it in a particular position. If you wear your watch on your arm with the face at the back of your hand and then point at the ceiling, it'll sometimes make a clicking noise that can be surprisingly loud. It's an odd position to be in though and it's only in a very particular position, so it doesn't at all detract from my overall impression of this watch.

EDIT: I've spent more time with this watch and I must say it looks awesome with everything from jeans to a suit. Another thing I'd add is that it is only "noisy" when the watch face isn't in contact with anything-e.g. when you have it upside down on your wrist and there's a gap, or when you leave it sideways on a table. In some positions it can actually get quite loud, but I can never maintain one of those long enough to figure out how to replicate it

It's black. It's made of steel with mineral, not plastic glass. Yes, it's heavy, but it seems indestructible. And that's why I really like it. Watch for a man who likes *solid* things

I have to say first I'm not a watch person. If I didn't need to know the time  for work I wouldn't even think about wearing one. That said, I got this to replace a broken Citizen, which was very thin and fairly small. This is much larger, but despite that it's pretty comfortable. Not heavy at all. The large dial is also nice for my aging eyes to read and the glowing hands are great at night. It's also a nice looking watch, dressy enough without being stodgy. If it's as sturdy as other people here have said, I expect I will be wearing it for a long time. I don't understand the problem people have setting the language for the day of the week. I guess it comes down to reading the directions, which are minimal but sufficient to set it up.  A darned nice watch for the money

I have been very pleased with this watch so far, and with my purchase experience through Amazon.  I have had better watch band clasps before, but this one isn't too bad.  It's just a little more prone to catch on things since the back side doesn't lay completely flat

I gave this watch to my son for Christmas.  He loves it. It keeps perfect time and is very stylish. The scrolling tic gets lots of comments. 

The only drawback to this watch is that it is very top heavy, so I would not recommend it to someone who has small wrists

 I've actually had the clip for more like 7yrs, but after about 4-5yrs I started to have a few problems like the pin that holds the clip together would come out. But I would just put it back in. After a while it does start to loosen and that being on both the money clip side and the card side. Just bend things back in shape and things are fine for a good while. I give it five stars because I am hard on thing and if it lasted 7yrs for me and my wife (she carries one also). Then it's more than worth it. All the things the first person complained about I find them a plus. Like cards and money being held. I like that feature. It finally gave up the ghost after 7 faithfull years.

The necklace and charm set was purchased as a gift for my 8-year old niece, who loves horses.  Both the chain and charm are high-quality and sturdy, while not looking heavy or bulky.  My niece loves the set

This watch is very attractive, and keeps perfect time - according to my puter and cell phone. I had no problem getting it started out of the box. However, it does'nt have the feel of a more expensive watch, that is, it's quite light-weight....and that may be a positive for many people. Overall, an exceptional value for $30

Casio has always made fine watches and this is no exception. It is very distinctive with it's yellow dial. The watch has the capability of automatically setting the correct time by looking for the signals that come out from Colorado and England. Unfortunately I live in Hawaii and there are no signals that reach here so that feature does not function

These earrings are just what I wanted!  Lightweight.  It's true that when you fasten them, you shouldn't "click" the post down into the clasp, it's better to gently insert the post into the clasp.  I love 'em

I've had this watch for a couple months now.  I have to say I haven't seen a better watch at price ranges up to 10x the cost.  It just works/keeps time extremely well.  It pairs simplicity w/ technical sophistication.  It duels as a dress watch as well as when I'm out in more casual settings.  The only thing that would make it more perfect is that Seiko figures out how to make this a perfect traveler's watch as well (timezone changes).  Then there would be no reason for really ever adjusting this watch... ever

It looks so precious and stylish. Very good price for a watch like this. I thought it's possible to get a refurbished watch for this price, but when I opened the box, I knew it's brand new. Amazon did a great job on the pricing.
The length is a little too long, but I got it fixed in a watch store for 10 bucks

Visually, this watch looks like it cost over $100. It has a depth to the face and shine on the bezel that really looks great. The band is very high quality and the latch works great. However, one day I was doing some work that required me to get a bit "physical" with a cardboard box and after I was done I looked down and the watch had stopped!!! I freaked out and started tapping the face hoping it would revive it. It started working again and I did a time-sync to get it back on schedule that afternoon. No problems since, but it doesn't make me really confident it the watch. But for a cheap formal watch it's just fine. Don't depend on it to keep you alive or anything

I bought the Wave Ceptor with the leather armband as a gift and it was received very well. I then bought the Silvertone for myself and I am very satisfied. If you read the directions carefully you can set the watch to your Home Time Zone and then it will set itself. Considering that there is a tiny radio receiver inside, I would say the watch is not too thick. The minute hand advances every 20 seconds which is interesting.
For the money it is quite a deal even if you have to replace the battery every 2 years. You may purchase batteries on ebay very reasonably and install it yourself if you have the right tools. I just wish there were a similarly priced watch for women

I, too, am disappointed in the misinformation Amazon originally posted in regards to the watch being solar-powered, but even without that feature it's still a great watch.

Now, for those of you who are WHINING about not being able to adjust the metal band on this wonderful watch, it's very easy. If you look at the inside of the band, some of the links have a small arrow stamped on them. Just put a very small screwdriver into one of the holes on the "arrow" side of one of those links and push. Do the same for the next "arrow" link. Remove both pins and the loose link. (Of course, you may have to remove more than one link!) Then connect the band back together and slide one of the pins into the "non-arrow" side to secure it. Make sure the slotted/pinched side of the pin goes in last. Push the pin in slightly to match the other links.

Hope this helps you appreciate this great watch a little more

I was pleasantly suprised when I opened the box and found that this watch looks even better in person.
I own a swiss army watch costing 3 times as much, and find that most watches in this price range feel light and flimsy compared to it. That is until I opened the box to my Fossil, this is a heavy solid feeling watch.
This watch is not for men with skinny wrists.
I liked this watch so much that I looked at other Fossil watches and can't decide witch one I will buy next

I originally wanted to purchase another pair of Celtic earrings, but Holly
informed me a few hours later the pair I chose was out of stock.  She immediately refunded my money.  As soon as I found out the pair I had chosen was not available, I chose these as a second choice.  They are very pretty. Just as described.  Elegant. Simple.  But not cheap looking.
Well worth the price.  They were packaged in a little zip lock bag and
tucked inside a little velvet like pouch.  Fine packaging for me.  They
were shipped securely and quickly.  I am sure my daughter is going to
love them.  I would definately purchase from Silver Insanity again.
Excellent customer service.  Excellent communications

I admit I don't know a whole lot about jewelery, luckily it wasn't a diamond, but using some of the previous reviews helped me to finally decided on this set. My wife really like them, love? I don't suppose but that's what diamonds are for I guess. They have that weight to them that I've been told is important and they look really great on my wife. She's gotten numerous compliments so I guess I must of done good.

These earrings are so beautiful!  The blue is very clear and the stone is wonderful and reflects different colors in certain light.  I bought this as a gift, but liked it so much that I am buying a pair for myself

These earrings have a very clear, summer sky blue stone. The stones are excellent quality. I sell Fine Jewelry, and I'll tell you, these earrings are set like fine diamonds.  I examined them.  The gold bar is solid, with a slight outward swell(not straight up and down), that allows the drop to be displayed at it's best. The butterfly back is tension set and very secure.  There are no openings in the circles that connect the earring components to the gold bar. Every part of the setting is solid and secure.  Generally, I like deeper blue topaz, but these stones are ideal for the way they are set.  The earrings are classic and elegant. They are light on the ear and comfortable. They're small--3/4 inch drop from the post. They have movement, but not enough to be distracting. Just enough to be noticed--very appropriate for business wear. These are truly classic, quality earrings that can be worn with anything, from jeans to dresswear. The earrings are presented in a midnight blue suede box with an ivory interior encased in a midnight blue gift box. I received these earrings one day after I was notified of shipment.  Thanks again Amazon, I know I can get quality jewelry at a GREAT price from you

I'm very pleased with this item. It is as described, very good quality and workmanship. The stone has a rich color and is securely set. The pattern is even and well proportioned. The silver is highly polished, heavy,and yet delicate in appearance.

This is a very cute pair of earrings for a child.  Customer service was great.  I received these close to Christmas and a stone fell out right away because it wasn't set well.  (The stones are tiny.)  They immediately sent out a new pair so I was able to give them as a Christmas gift

The only thing I dislike about the hoops is that their back side is hollow and you cannot see it on the photos-this makes them very light-weight. Nevertheless, they look very dainty and sophisticated, the "rocks" aren' that sparkly, but with the clarity stated in the description they aren't supposed to be. I like them a lot coz they are perfect for everyday - the reason why I bought them. Be realistic! If you want to get a pair of great quality, nice weight hoops with quality diamonds - shell out at least 1K. 
P.S. These would be great for girls from 5 and up

These are a great pair of earrings for the dollar.  They are perfect small hoops that can be dressed up or dressed down but still elegant.  They are not huge diamond blingy earrings, and if that is what you want then you should choose another pair

I love fossily watches.  My only beef with fossil is that all of their metal watches are heavy like bricks.  The downside with this particular model is the quartz that covers the face.  The cover bows out like a contact lens.  This causes the watch lens to scratch if you lay it down on its face frequently.

If you're careful, this won't be a problem - but it's too late for me. :-

Atomic watches are highly-accurate quartz watches which are synchronized each day with a time signal broadcast in the U.S. from the definitive U.S. Atomic Clock in Ft. Collins, Colorado. Thus, all atomic watches are always accurate to within a fraction of a second at any time. Since atomic watches adjust automaticaly to and from daylight saving time they are convenient as well as highly accurate. Casio makes -- and Amazon sells -- a wide selection of styles of atomic watches to suit various needs and tastes, including G-Shock watches for extra ruggedness and solar-powered watches which never need replacement batteries. But all atomic watches, including this budget-priced Waveceptor model, are equally accurate to a fraction of a second at all times. If you want an attractive watch that is always accurate and do not need other special features, this model is a real bargain.

Very nice watch but... it's much smaller & lighter than I thought it would be. 

I had read that it was smaller than the Seiko Divers, this was a plus since the Seiko's are too large for me. However... this watch could stand to be just a tad bigger.

More pluses... 
The dial markers glows with a blue tint, instead of the green of most watches.
The rubber band is quite comfortable & secure using 2 "hold downs" for the excess length that goes thru the buckle.

Downside...
The Citizen logo is imprinted on the band. This is a bit much in IMO, but I'm sure that it will eventually wear off.

Overall a very nice watch... just not a big diver's watch as one might expect

This same model watch was purchased for me 20-years ago for my 10th birthday and it still keeps 100% accurate time.  The rubberized band tends to were out after about 2-3 years of everyday use.  I would suggest replacing it with a stainless-steel metal band, which can be purchased at any major retailer.  The metal band also adds to the attractiveness of the watch....at least in my opinion.  Overall, a fantastic product !

I bought this clip as a gift for my husband, and both he and I were very pleased with it.  It is a little small, but very attractive and looks even better after having been engraved.  In reference to the previous review, it will not hold a thick "wad" of bills, but it holds a few hundred dollars (in $20s) quite nicely.

Graduated from the original Ironman Flix- the size and illumination of the numbers work much better- functions are all about the same as the older model but easier to navigate.  The only complaint is that the band is a little ornery (some extra notch that secures the band also makes it harder to get off- probably could cut it off) but overall very nice upgrade

 My granddaughter just loved this little heart. Then again, I think she could get a can of dirt from her grandpa and she would love it. :-) It is a nice little pendant for a 8 year old; don't try giving it to your wife or sweetheart. It is a bit tacky for that purpose, just fine for the kids

I bought this watch when it was on sale a while ago. The face is quite large, measuring 1-5/8" on its outside rim, making it a little too big for people with small wrists. The band, though, has enough holes that it will fit most anyone, though it too is a bit uncomfortable on small wrists. The leather band is fairly thick, but two stays are included to keep the end of the band from flapping.

The watch face is silver with a brushed finish. Many claim that the face "has a lot going on", which is true with four sub-dials, but it keeps with the style of a pilot watch. These subdials show the month, date, moon phase, and day, all with deep red hands on a cocentric-design silver background. The time is easy to read with red-tipped hands and hour ticks. There are additional ticks, five per minute, which seem extraneous and only there for design.

The bezel has a series of numbers allowing for conversion calculations of volume (liters, US gallons, and imperial gallons) and distance (kilometers, nautical miles, and statute miles), which are probably useful if you're a pilot, but not to many others.

The best design feature are the push-button adjustments. While the time is the familiar crown that is pulled and turned, the day, date, and month can all be advanced with a simple push of one of three buttons. This is much easier than having to pull out the tiny crown to just the right tick and then turn.

The watch is also water resistant to 100m but I have never tried it.

On the whole, the watch looks good and keeps with the form of a pilot watch. Due to its leather band, it is more an informal watch, and works best with bigger wrists. A thinner or metal band and slighly more comfortable fit would have been nice

Based on the picture, I thought these earrings might have a little bit more of a "puffed" effect, but they don't - and it's ok! :-)  These are really sweet earrings. They are small ( 1/4 inch east-west and 1/8 inch north-south) but they feel very sturdy, and the screw-clasp is nice! They really show up and reflect the light very well. These would work for either a child/young person or an adult. Definitely recommend these earrings for all-around wear

Beautifully detailed and shining as only sterling silver shines, I am extremely pleased with this product.  I bought this for my fiance for X-mas.  This little ponies will make a wonderful gift or a great stocking stuffer.  I bought them to go with the "Running Horse Pony Sterling Silver Pendant" which I also purchased at Amazon.  If you have a horse lover that wears pierced earrings, this would be a perfect gift and you can find many other horse related jewelry items on Amazon.com to go with these earring

This is a very masculine, heavy watch.My Brother in law stated,"that isn't a watch, it's a weapon!" The "Pros":  Good looking, all stainless steel, Crystal is well protected by deep face, lighted dial works well, bracelet is well made with "easy to adjust" band, fairly easy to adjust all functions,keeps time and sets itself very well,solar feature is reliable, "radium" numerals and hands last through the night.  The "Cons": The watch looks and feels heavy, The red hour hand is detrimental at times, the three "windows" at the bottom of the dial are fairly hard to read, the automatic light with a twist of the wrist is a nuisance at night--I switched it off, Alarm hasn't been tried so I can't comment on that.  All in all, I'm delighted with the watch and for the money it's a steal !

I love Casio G-Shock watches. I actually had another one (G2210). It is solid and reliable. I never had problem with it. I saw this GW1400DA on Amazon last week and wow it's absolutely best deal I have ever seen. I placed order and it arrived a week later. I LOVE it! Use my swiss army knife to adjust the steel band. It took me 10 minutes. Yes the watch looks a little bulky, but that's it's style. Some people may not like this design but I do. Being the "toughest watch in the world", it can not be thin

This is really a great watch. I am a firefighter and I need watches that can stand the toughest environments.....I always wear a G-Shock. Having already owned a G-Shock before buying this watch, I know this thing will last me a lifetime. A great thing about this particular watch is that not only does it have the durability of a genuine G-Shock, it also has great looks. I wear this watch on a nice outfit and people think I'm wearing a really expensive watch. Little do they know I only spent less than $100 on it.
    Some of the other cool features of this watch are the auto time setting via the atomic clock and especially the solar power. All my life I dealt with watches that need a battery replacement, and after wearing a watch for a long time and the screws on the back cover become permanently attached to the case, battery replacement becomes a pain in the *$%! This watch on the other hand you never need to worry about batteries.....simply put it by the window sill when it says it needs charging.
    Lastly, I love the light-up feature. No need to fumble with any buttons for the watch to light up to read time in the dark. The watch is smart enough to sense ambient light on its solar cells to know if the light-up feature needs to be activated. So if you are out in the sun and look at your watch, the light doesn't come on. And also, the great feature about the light is also that it never drains the battery. If you happen to drain the battery (which would like never happen unless you've been living in the dark for like a year), simply place the watch under a desk lamp or by the window during the day. The darn thing charges itself if you walk around without the front of the watch being covered.
    I love this watch and have grown ever so confident in Casio and it's life of G-Shock watches. You can never go wrong with this watch

Very nice quality.  Thought the Atomic timekeeping would be more of a gimmick but now I really appreciate as I never need to adjust time.  I like the looks but wife thinks it is too bulky.  I gave it 4 stars because the red hour hand and the small LCD windows are not easy to read at a glance

As other reviewers have said, the instructions that come with the watch are pretty much useless. Also, the watch arrived with a dead battery. When I went to get a new one the person at the watch store was able to set it for me. All in all, not a bad deal for a $99 watch, even with the added expense of a new battery.
My husband is very pleased with it and because it was so affordable, he doesn't have to stress over something happening to it.

After several false starts with other HRMs I found the Imara through "My Amazon". I'm technically inept and this was the only HRM that I could set and use by myself. When I run with a large group there's no problem with "cross talk". Beauty! The back light function helps at night. 

I do like the larger and slanted face of the other Nike products, this one could use that as well. The strap is no bother, just tuck it under the lip of the sports bra.

what a great deal and a fun product. I like it because it doesn't make me hot when I exercise the way a full banded watch would. It is also pretty durable and who cares if it fails! I usually wear two in case one goes nuts. Thanks for the cute product. By the way I am a 60 year old female so it isn't just for kids anymore

I've ordered several sets, since I keep losing them due to the lousy clasp on the stem that holds the earring in the ear.  Good price if you have to keep replacing them like I do

These earrings are quite big. I sort of wish I ordered 7.5 mm instead. They are very bright and shiny gold. The quality is much better and cheaper than ball earrings I've seen in department stores. Infact I've seen these style earrings at Mervyn's that didn't look as good for $50.

I purchased the light blue and dark red versions of these earrings. I just love them. I can wear them to work in professional attire, or with jeans on the weekend. I am a 40-something professional, atheletic grandmother. I want to look stylish but not faddish. These earrings are just the style that help me surprise people when they find out I am a "Nana!

As always, Silver Insanity matches gorgeous jewelry with good prices. The garnets were the perfect deep red that i love. These earings were perfect and lighter than expected, I also got the blue topaz version and loved it as well. With their quick shipping on top of everything else, Silver Insanity is my favorite seller

This ring is awesome. It is well made and amazing how it fits together. My only complaint is that the idea of a puzzle ring is misleading. I thought that all four bands would come totally apart from each other. I was going to keep two rings for myself and give two rings to another person as a representation that we are two pieces, but when we are together we are whole. The problem is the rings are all inter-looped, so in order to do this I am going to have to cut them and solder them together. The other thing was, which is good for someone who doesn't want to worry about it falling apart....is that once I clipped the white band that was holding it together, it didn't fall all apart. I was expecting it to just fall to pieces. I literally had to struggle and pull at it to get it to come apart....in fact I lost patience in getting it apart and had to give it to someone else to pull apart. So as long as you aren't trying to use it like I wanted to, this ring is perfect for you. It doesn't come apart easily and they are all looped together so you can't lose any of the pieces

I got this ring for my girlfriend for her birthday. We both loved it, it is really quite beautiful. Yet we still can't put it back together. It has been apart for about two months now, it's really disappointing. If you're amazing at putting things together, than you'll like it. If you're not, you'll probably still like it, but you might wan to leave it together

Atomic watches are highly-accurate quartz watches which are synchronized each day with a time signal broadcast in the U.S. from the definitive U.S. Atomic Clock in Ft. Collins, Colorado. Thus, all atomic watches are always accurate to within a fraction of a second at any time. Since atomic watches adjust automaticaly to and from daylight saving time they are convenient as well as highly accurate. Casio makes -- and Amazon sells -- a wide selection of styles of atomic watches to suit various needs and tastes, including G-Shock watches for extra ruggedness and solar-powered watches which never need replacement batteries. But all atomic watches, including this Waveceptor model, are equally accurate to a fraction of a second at all times. If you want an attractive watch that is always accurate, this model is a real bargain

This was a gift for my husband. He is pretty picky about what he wears. Watches are one of his passions and his knowledge about them is well beyond mine. I was, therefore, reticent in selecting one, not knowing if it would have been a timepiece he would have purchased. Keeping all that in mind, and after having studied several offerings online, I chose this one. To me, it was very attractive, with some fine bells and whistles. Thankfully, my husband found the watch to his liking and he wears if often.

These earrings are adorable.  They're light and comfortable to wear. The size is perfect for me since I only have one hole in each ear. These earrings are neither so small that they will go unnoticed nor are they so big that they will detract attention from the vintage pendants and necklaces I love to wear. Gold ball earrings were the first earrings I had when I was a baby so a bit of nostalgia probably was also involved in my decision to buy these beauties. My sister calls them "old-fashioned" but I think that they are rather "classics." They go with everything. Whether I'm dressing casual or formal, a pair of these earrings is never "too much."

To those who feel the 7mm are too big; they are not.  To those who feel the quality may be marginal; the quality is superior.
I have worn them for several months straight - never removing them and they have fully met my expectations.  I recommend them without reservation

The basic problem with this kit is its most essential piece. The blue plastic link remover does not come with replacement pins. It requires focus to properly align the tool's push pin with the friction-fitted watch band link pin. The novice wll almost certainly bend or snap the push pin at some point. When I called the company for a replacement pin, a representative didn't hesitate to offer it by mail without charge. So, why not include a few in the kit? The kit's long nose pliers are good quality and needed to extract a watch band's dislodged link pin. The tweezers and (six) screwdrivers are useful in some situations, but a small hammer to make flush the replaced link pin is always useful. My kit came with instructions but why not an illustration? The kit's list price of one hundred dollars doesn't add up. A hardware store will sell comparable quality long nose pliers for about ten dollars. Tweezers and a set of jewelry screwdrivers are easily available. The link remover is a specialized tool but it is plastic. At the sale price of $25 this is a fair value, but you will want to ask for a couple of replacement pins with your order

Just purchased the kit, the watch link remover tool has a cheap feel but does the job, the link remover pin was bent, but the plier they included did well to straighten the link remover pin.  The Link remover did work well, but lacked the fine adjustments.  The box was cheap paper and they items are packed in foam with cutouts for each tool.  The pliers has already chewed up the foam cutout meant for the plier.  One thing missing is the watch cover opener, otherwise it is a decent set

My wife enjoys these earrings. They are lightweight and attractive. My only concern is that because they are so lightweight, my wife has found it easy to lose one; it has happened a couple of times. Therefore, I would recommend getting a couple of backing elements (I forget what they are called.) to go with them, or maybe they should be furnished with them. Other than that, they were a welcomed present that my wife enjoys.

The two-toned crossover design of these hoops adds more interest and pizzazz to the standard hoop.  The size is just right for me: big enough to show off the twist in the design but not so big that it is overwhelming. I also like the weight: lighter than they appear so that I don't feel like I am carrying a load on my ears. I also happen to like the hinge and snap type closure. Good looking gift box, even if it's just a gift to myself. Why not five stars? - Wish that everything that I want costs at least 10% less

This is a great looking watch and the vendor was very straight forward in fulfilling the purchase (no hassles whatever).  The main difficulty is that the watch is impossible to read in low light/dark conditions.  It has no light and the silver hands against the silver face don't provide enough contrast to read in low light conditions (like a restaurant)

I'm a watch guy. I believe that the only jewelery a man should where besides his wedding ring (if he must) is a watch. I collect them and resell them to pay for my own collection. I bought this watch in blue and was so impressed by the look, it sold me on Invictas! It is absolutely gorgeous and looking at it online does not do it any justice. This watch sells everywhere else, except ebay for close to $125 + shipping. The blue face one goes with more clothing but this one is an eye catcher and if you can pull it off, go for it

When shopping around for a new watch, this model fit the bill perfectly. Analogue face, with additional functions (date, stopwatch, alarm), waterproof, in a perfectly sized case. 

The bonus is the finish - black (very dark grey?) with gold details. I thought all metal cased watches these days are silver or gold with little variation, so it was a nice surprise to find this model.

One slight gotcha - what appears to be the "second" hand on the face is not actually the second hand. It is used for the stopwatch. There is a smaller face (located at 9 o'clock on the main dial) that counts the seconds. A little odd, but not a big deal.

Still very happy with the product. All this and got it half price from Amazon. Nice one

Hey, I've been contemplating buying these hoops for a while, but their new price helped me make a decision. I got them in just 2 days and they are very well-made and the closures are solid, feels like you'll never loose them. They are perfect, not too big, not too small and are light-weight. I also like that they are kind of thickiesh, very noticeable ans shiny. A bargain! Thanks AMAZON

I really liked the 14K Yellow Gold Round Hoop Earrings that I recently ordered from Amazon.com.  They were purchased at a fabulous price and were better quality I thought than the gold hoops that I had paid twice the amount for.  They were very light weight and the gold was a nice quality.  I would purchase these earrings again for myself and for gifts in the future

I absolutely fell in love with these earrings. They look classy and elegant while at the same time you can wear them with casual clothes. They are about an inch and a half wide and length wise to give you a better idea on size. They are so comfortable that I often fall asleep with them on and don't notice they're still on till morning. I know I'll be wearing these for years to come

I bought a pack  of watches for my 14 yr old because he doesnt want to wear his good watch skate boarding.  He gave out a few watches to his skate buddies and the word got out.....everyone is calling and asking where he got it. (he actually kept the PINK one and gave the rest away) So I ordered 2 more packs.  Imagine pleasing a 14 yr old with such a reasonable item. I cant wait for the new order to arrive and neither can he

I actually purchased these in March 2004 and to give some perspective, they are so well made that today they are as good when I first purchased them.  I did beat the current price, but at $19, they are still worth it.  They are on the smaller side, as other reviews have noted, but they are still perfect for young granddaughters and those of us who prefer smaller hoops

My wife is a big fan of Little Mermaid and half jokingly said she wanted an Ariel watch for Christmas.If you want Micky, Minnie, Tinkerbell, Winnie or the 3 princesses, you're in luck - their easy. Ariel, for adults anyway, is darned hard to come by.  This was the ONLY decent Ariel watch I saw. Even then, I had to buy a new band for it as this is a kids watch. As for the watch, it really is a nice looking watch and if you put a "real" band on it, you'd never know it was a kids watch. Anyway, she liked it and I'm a hero

This is my first time purchased at Amazon.  The product I purchased is what I expected.  However, I must say Amazon extremely needs to improve customer service and organizational skill.  The watch I purchased did not include any sale receipt.  There was no warranty information included.  And most of all, no instruction manual came with the watch.  The box for the watch is torn and ripped apart.  This is not to mention I had a defective watch shipped to me before.  Obviously I have overrated Amazon before my purchase.  After this experience, I felt as though I made a purchase on-line through a "mom and pop" business versus a fortune 500 company.  I don't think it would take a rocket scientist to figure out if I will make any future purchase at Amazon

I ordered 2 pair of these earrings on the Friday sale and just received them yesterday and I absolutely loved them!  I actually ordered 2 pair of white and 2 pair of the gold.  I gave a pair of each to my daughter who's 7 yrs old and she put the gold one on right away and hasn't taken them off yet.  I put the white gold one on too and I have't taken them off either.  My other girl who's 4 and doesn't have her ears pierced yet said that she want's to go get her ears pierced on her birthday so she can wear those earrings.

These are the best earrings for the price.  They're definitely great gifts for anyone who has their ears pierced

I bought two pair of these earrings in April 2005 for $10 each, one for me and one for a granddaughter.  Now Amazon is running them for $9 on the Friday sale.  It's not too soon to be thinking about Christmas stocking stuffers.  These would be perfect.  These are real gold, quality earrings.  I love mine and have worn them now for almost two years with no problems, having to be careful about metal allergies.  What are you waiting for

The trick to the earrings is that the crystal has a small gold foil glued to the back.  Light enters the crystal, reflects off the foil and then refracts back out through the crystal and that's what it give them a great sparkle.  They're not as blue as they are in the picture, but still sparkle all different colors.

My girlfriend instantly loved these and wore them for a week straight after getting them.  If you or your intended recipient likes "oooh shiny" and "oooh sparkly" things - these are perfect.  She also says that they're quite comfortable to wear

After reading some of the reviews, I was concerned that the product might not come as described.  However, my package arrived exactly as described in the description.  My tool arrived in a wooden box, with padding and slots to hold all of the inserts.  The tool comes with more sets of inserts than I expected, also.  There aren't really any instructions with it, but I had no problems figuring it out.  I am not a watch repair expert, I just needed to replace some batteries.  I was successfully using it within 3 minutes of opening it

I was able to replace a battery in my watch. It didn't come with any instructions. I experienced some of the same problems other reviewers had with the bits being loose and falling out, but I discovered you have to push them into the sockets hard. They were snug after that. Then you have to adjust the tool to fit the slots on your watch. Hold the watch in one hand. Turn left to loosen the back, then right to tighten. It came in a nice wooden box

I can't give it 5 stars, it's not perfect.

I have a lot of watch tools, and this is a nice one.  The case is nice, and it works as it should.

But, again, it's not perfect.  The pins don't stay in, making it harder to use (you have to use it upside down, and the pins don't lock in).  And there should be instructions for those who don't know exactly how to use it.  The little half-sheet that is included is all but useless.

But it's a great deal for the price.  Easily opens the notch-back cases I use it on

I was surprised at how well it has worked and ended up buying a second one.  It costs only a fraction of the price of others that do the same thing.  While it has a cheap plastic case, it doesn't look bad and is virtually noiseless.  If you have a very heavy watch I would recommend the single winder version since the watch angle is flatter (heavy watches cause the verical two-watch winder to bang around a little). My winder has been running non-stop for the past couple of months with no problems. This device is a good value for what you pay

I collect watches.  Right now I have 4 watch winders ranging in price from this one up to $$$.  This winder has been perfect so far.  It is silent, I dont mean quiet, silent.  I have it on my night stand about 3 feet from my head and I dont hear it.  The retainers are perfect for me, I have an 8.5" wrist and usually have problems with pillows that are smaller, they wont hold the bracelets.  Not a problem with this winder.  If it stays this quiet (some get louder after a while) then I will buy more, a lot more

This is by far the best deal on a watch winder yet.  It runs quiet. I have it in the same room as our desktop computer and I can't hear it over the computer cooling fan. So I would rate the sound quality in the excellent to very good range.

The overall construction is molded plastic, but for the price point that is fine.  The watch holders are very functional and have a nice spring tension mechanism that holds the watches in place.  I have a relatively small wrist and it accomodates my watches without any problems.

The unit rotates at approximately 6 rotations per minute. Based on this, each mode of operation runs as follows:

Position A = 344 RPD
Position B = 864 RPD
Position C = 1234 RPD
Position D = 2468 RPD
RPD (rotations per day)

This winder also has three seperate rotating positions: CW/Auto/CCW.  In all this is a great buy and a must for anyone with a few automatic watches in the collection.

Overall this is an excellent purches and I plan on buying another one soon

I removed links from my new Seiko band. No problem. I can see how a doofus might need the extra parts, while they are learning the proper technique. Press down FIRMLY on the band with your thumb to prevent it from moving while you turn the knob with your other hand. The base under the band is spring-loaded with a Strong spring. If you allow the band to move while you are pushing the pin out, you may break off the part that's doing the pushing. Get the band and pin lined up exactly before proceeding - or - you may break the little pusher part. Good Luck - it's a good tool.

I purchased these earrings and I am excited about the quality but not the size.  To be fair, I knew little about diamond studs until I did research on Amazon and learned a bunch over the course of a couple of weeks, but the one thing I wish I'd seen was pictures of diamond studs in "actual" size next to each other -i.e. not blown up on the screen to look pretty.  The 1/4, the 1/3, the 1/2, the 3/4, and the 1 carat total weight pairs would have been nice to see all at once.  Had I seen this I might have opted for the larger size (and perhaps slightly lower quality so as to afford it).  Yes, you can print the helpful "actual size" report from Amazon, but this does not have any small sizes except for the 1/2 and 1 carat studs (and nothing in between).

One more thing, the gemological report that I received was NOT as detailed as the "sample" on the website.  There appears to be an actual photo of my diamonds on my report but you do NOT see the drawings that show flaws and occlusions.  This would have been nice.  Also, there are fewer descriptive terms in the ratings than I expected.  For example, on my certificate it says "G-G/G-G" for Polish and Symmetry.  Although it was bound and presented well, I had hoped for something more like the sample on the website.

On the flip side, these diamonds are really high quality.  I compared them to a coworkers larger studs and it was immediately apparent that these were colorless and clear (to my eyes) while the others were a bit cloudy and not as nice.

The quality of the studs was as advertised.  One stud was VS-1 and the other was VS-2 and the color for both was G-H.  The Total Carat Weight was 0.72 (not the 0.75 as hoped for) but this was above the guaranteed minimum spec. of 0.70.

The product was received very quickly, and was well packaged and presented.  I would absolutely purchase this type of thing from Amazon again..

The color and clarity appears to be better than expected, according to IGI certification.  I have not yet brought to a jeweler for review but according to IGI I got more than I expected.  The size, however, was exactly .7 - the minimum allowable size.  I was a little upset about this so I will hope the color and clarity sparkles for my wife on Christmas morning...

All in all, good experience purchasing - just wish the size had hit a little closer to .7

The pendant is very solid, a high quality item. The stone is set firmly and it's got weight to it too. If it's your style it's a good buy. The price is right considering what a quality product it is. I think I'd trust the seller again too

I purchased the Jewel Jet in hopes of being able to keep my wife's rings as clean and sparkling as when we have them cleaned at a jewelry store. The results after using the jewel jet are as good (if not better) than when we do have them professionally cleaned.  The machine is light and easy to use.  Just fill the top with 8 oz of water, wait three minutes, and push the button.  It is that easy and the results are wonderful.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to keep their jewelry looking as new as the day it was purchased

I am impressed with how easy this machine is to use. The directions are straight forward, and the machine is ready to use almost immediately after plugging it in. Some reviewers said that this was a HUGE machine, but I didn't think it was big at all. It cleaned my diamond rings and other jewelry really well. It even shined my gold bands that had become quite dull (I didn't even notice how dull they were until the Jewel Jet made them shiny again as I was trying to clean the diamond on my ring). Overall, I think this is a great product, and I enjoy the fact that I no longer have to take my jewelry anywhere to be cleaned.

These earrings are beautiful and sturdy but a bit smaller than I expected. they are still a good deal and have good weight and good clasps. I looked at department stores and did not find anything like these or of this quality at either store. I also looked on other websites and would have had to pay more for similar earrings

I received these pearls as a gift. They come nicely packaged and the shipping was pretty speedy. The pearls aren't very big but I can wear them to work everyday without feeling like I'm overdressed. They have a nice luster, feel cool and heavy when worn. The only complaint is that the gold clasps aren't very strong. Overall, very nice set and great price

This is a modestly priced nicely designed watch. It is understated and timeless in its appearance. I think it's a bargain

Thin and light. The only complaint is that the lock on the band can easily come loose when the watch is not worn

You can't beat the quality and design for the price!  The watch goes well for business casual and casual.  There are many standard options including alarm, two date complications, and military time.  In addition, the watch can take a beating and withstands some pretty tough water pressure.  Pick this one up if you are into watches

Watch is perfect for my beach time and travel.  The resin band can get wet with sweat or water without the smell like other bands.  I love the dual time feature - It's great to have the hands on local time and the digital on my home turf time.  Style and features are perfect and the price was great - I love it

I am happy with the watch so far.  I have only had it for about two weeks, but I'm enjoying it.  It's a little heavy, but I am used to a smaller watch.  I'm sure it will serve me well for years to come.  I would recommend it to anyone considering purchasing it

The watch winder works exactly as described. I think this is a good value product. Especially when compared to the multi hundreds dollar watch winders on the market. It does look a little bit plastic. But the winder is well built and is reasonably quit when turning.

It comes with 4 different timer settings and 3
different turning direction settings: left, right and alternating.
I calculated the number of rotations per day based some measurements.

Setting:
        A:  rotate 33 seconds, rest 12 minutes:  300  rotations/day
        B:  rotate 10 minutes, rest 90 minutes:  660  rotations/day
        C:  rotate 30 minutes, rest 3 hours   :  940  rotations/day
        D:  rotate 1 hour, rest 3 hours       :  1700 rotations/day

I use setting B for my watch with ETA 2824 movement. Every watch has a specific requirement as of how many rotations per day it needs to remain fully wound. See you watch specifications.

The winder does not come with the possibillity to run on batteries, that is a pity I think.

As I just bought it I can not say anyting about long term reliabillity but assuming it keeps on running I think this i a very good buy.
So far I am very pleased with it

The first thing to note is that the Timex web site claims a three-year battery life, while Amazon claims eight years.  I hope Amazon is right, but you should know what the manufacturer thinks ;)

My wife chose this watch because of its looks, and I must admit that it looks rather nice.  This is definately no-frills.  No compass, no alarm, no stopwatch.  But it tells the time and date.

Besides looking sharp, my favorite thing is the size/weight -- it is rather thin and light.  I wanted a watch with more features, but I could not stand the thought of something larger and heavier.

There is really not much to complain about.  The date display is rather small.  The band is also advertised as being "water resistant leather" but I would not want to take it swimming.  Only time will tell how it hold up.  I also do not know why watch manufacturers continue to use cheap zinc glow powder for the hands.  Newer strontium-based powders are available that still glow great after eight hours.  Oh well, all manufacturers do this, and it can light up the entire face so the glow powder is really not even needed.

So, to summarize, it is small and light for a metal men's watch, and it looks great.  Guys, one look at this and the ladies will know that you are a man who is comfortable in the deep woods

Like wearing a piece of artwork. Very substatial and highly crafted. I
would recommend it for males beacause it is big and fairly heavy.
I have a piece I bought for $38 and this design is similar. Great for silver chain and for casual dress up. Tough to beat for the price!It definitely stands out

I am a runner, and purchased this watch for timing my miles on long runs.  It is easy to read, but I found it very confusing to use the first few times.  Don't lose the instructions!  I found it easy to time laps, but had trouble with the recall portion.  I had to sit down with the instructions a few times, but once I got the hang of it, I like it.

Never did I think I would ever buy a diamond online from a discount department store. Never. But when I saw the price I thought, what could I lose? I haven't looked at it with a magnifying glass or anything, but it looks white and sparkly. Not yellow or obviously flawed at all. And nobody is going to get that close to your earrings to look for hidden flaws anyway! A great buy for the money

Both watches wear and feel great when worn, they look sleek and nice while being very durable, and yes, they keep excellent time.  I am very impressed with the quality and will definitely have Skagen in mind when it's time to purchase another watch.  You will love this watch.  You can wear it for style, for dress and casual; it's a good fit for all occassions

great watch! I have had mine for several years. very elegant and very lightweight. The only issue I had with the watch is that the black mesh wears off over time. Eventually the whole band turns a metallic gray/black. I recently lost mine after several years of trouble free use and plan on buying a new one even with the worn band....

I like this watch because it is thin, thin, thin.  It doesn't have a bulkly weight or size.  The best part is that it looks sophisticated.  It can be casual in casual clothes or can be very dressy when I'm dressed up

My son has severe reactions to the nickel used in most watches.  His flesh actually blisters in reaction.  Finding a watch for him has been difficult until we stumbled upon Skagen Titanium.  This is his second Skagen.  He wore the first for years until it was damaged in a basketball game.  (He refused to take it off!)  He's a junior in college now and I just purchased a second Skagen for him.  In addition to being a beautiful watch, it's an excellent time piece and we don't have to worry about any negative allergic reaction.
Thanks, Skage

The picture on the web makes the display look like the numbers are much brighter than they actually are.  I didn't think I would like the black backgound but running with this watch under bright conditions, the numbers are very easy to read.  The only complaint I have is that sometimes I don't press the lap button hard enough and I find that I haven't changed laps at my mile markers

got my watch a few days back. 

first thing one notices, it is nicely packaged.  

however, the disappointment came when i learned that the CRYSTAL IS NOT SAPPHIRE as advertised here (usually it is stamped on the backcase), but the less expensive MINERAL. i wrote croton's customer service 2 emails regarding this issue, and got no reply - so much for one reviewer's claim of "best customer service company in america"... 

i finally got a confirmation from amazon (and very promptly - i was pleasantly surprised), that the crystal is in fact mineral - so why haven't they updated this in the product description? after all, it makes a huge difference, since sapphire is much more expensive.

nice solid case and bracelet (the clasp looks a bit weak), crystal back. the printing on the face looks kind of cheap. the glow in the dark stuff is not that good - hardly holds any "charge".

better than my $50 casio, but overall, despite the low price ($75). i wish now i had saved my money and invested in something tried like a seiko automatic instead. my next watch will be a seiko black monster

I bought this watch by pure chance while browsing, I wanted a watch that is cheap and looks good and automatic.  This watch actually is very expensive at other places, and it is actually expensive watch.  I bought it on special from Amazon, it cost me only 59 dollars.  I like the watch, and never need replacing batteries.  I am not a watch expert, and not in to watch qualities, but this watch is good

Heavy stainless steel, sapphire crystal, Japanese automatic movement AND it looks great!  I got this with free shipping at an EXTREMELY (under $70.00) reduced price via a previous Amazon Friday Sale - well worth it - now that I think of it, I should have bought more as presents..

Just got it today from amazon, very nice watch very sharp looking. Black dial makes the look of it. I have simular watch with silver/while dial from Missimo. I needed another one to go with my black suites and to wear to work, that is not bulky or heavy. Overall very pleased with the purchase. One thing though, it was very important that bracelet is a Fold Over Clasp type. You can not tell from the photo and pulsar's website does not mention the bracelet type either, but it is. So for those who want nice watch with Fold Over Clasp bracelet and does not want to spend a lot i would definitely recomend checking this out. Hope this helps

As I was shopping for a new watch, I had a certain number of criteria in mind.

1.  It must be affordable
2.  It must be from a recognized brand (for quality purposes)
3.  It must be stylish without being too fad-ish
4.  It must be multi-purpose and lend itself to almost all 
    styles of dress, be it casual or formal.

I found all of this in this little Seiko watch.  At first, I was setting my sights on a no-battery type of design, but after reading about both kinetic and solar watches...and finding out that both do require replacement of either a lithium ion battery or capacitor, neither of which were guaranteed to last longer than a regular battery operated watch...I decided to stick with the regular quartz.

The watch itself looks better than its picture.  The dial is listed as white on the website, but it's actually a silver tone...similar to what you see on Rolex brands (which it's supposed to mimic).  The gold has a nice shine to it, with particular sparkle coming from the marked hours and the pie-cut bezel around the watch face.  There is luminous material on the watch hands and hour markers, but a very minimal amount.  My guess is that they didn't want to detract from the shiny finish, but you do lose some ability to see the watch face at night.  There's enough to see the watch hands...just barely...but the hours are really hard to make out in the dark.  Oh well, if checking the time at night is a real issue then I suggest looking at some Timex Indiglos. ***REVISION*** While it is hard to see the luminous hands and markers at first, they do get brighter once your eyes adjust to the dark.  I found myself waking up early this morning and could clearly see all the marked hours and hands of my watch face with no problems.

This watch also comes with a day and date calendar.  Some have said it's hard to work, but I actually found it to be really easy.  The instructions are very easy to follow and I had the calendar and time set up in about 2 minutes.  

This watch is surprisingly lightweight and very comfortable to wear.  The catch opens without breaking any nails off and the band is very roomy.  I have a medium to large sized wrist and wear my watch in a slightly loose "bracelet" style, but I still had to get a couple of links taken out.

My verdict:  a good watch at a good price.  It goes with everything in my closet and is from a company that's known for excellence and durablility.  Five Stars

This is a great watch. I like that you can wear both silver and gold with it. I like the fact that it's water proof but I still take it off to go in the shower or in the pool. It often gets mistaken for a Rolex

This necklace is a cute toggle knockoff. It isn't even real silver for Pete's sake but no one would be able to tell from just looking while you're wearing it. It did fit me a little tighter than expected. But I never had one of these so I didnt know what to expect. Plus I guess it depends on weight, neck size etc. Anyway, I thought it was going to be a hunk of junk since it is only five dollars but bought a few for my nieces because they needed costume jewelry. Beleive it or not this baby is nice enough to wear out. Don't believe me ? Gamble the five dollars

I do not own this version, but another Invicta, as well as other watches with screw down crowns. What this means is you cannot pull out the crown without unscrewing it, which is done counter clockwise. It will then pop out. Then you push the crown in and screw it clockwise with gentle inward pressure to screw it down.
There is some discussion of the proper care while using the crown on the web. Apparently this is the area where you have the greatest potential to do damage to your watch, any watch. So be gentle, especially when setting the time, date, etc. With most watches you shouldn't do this near midnight. And perhaps do a search on the Web.
The Invicta instruction booklets are completely generic, so it is not surprising that some people might be confused

The instruction manual is not very accurate. The watch seems to work as advertised. One reviewer here mentioned that they couldn't pull the pin out to adjust the time, per the instructions in the manual. I had the same problem, but what they forgot to mention was you had to turn the pin counter clock-wise, then the pin will pop out a little, then one can pull the pin out to adjust the time. When you are done, you do the reverse. So far, I am happy with my purchase. Smart looking watch

I was looking for a watch that I would feel comfortable wearing to business engagements and yet still not feel over-accessorized walking though The Home Depot. This watch came up numerous times in searches in Amazon. The criteria I was looking for was 1) sapphire crystal, 2) multi-faced dial, 3) not too flashy, and 4) price. The biggest problem with the typical "fashionably sporty" watch is that the faces are too big or too thick or simply contrasts too much with the band. I dislike black faced dials on a polished bezel and band. This watch had it all.

The watch is of the utmost quality. You could go to Macy's and pay $400 for this same watch. The band is nicely polished and the clasp is typical Seiko, that's good. The hands are all aligned perfectly in the 12 position and adjustable if they're not. Mine were not out of the box. The hands are actually blue, but provides a nice hint of color on an otherwise bland face, very appealing. There is a nice weight to the watch. Its actually lighter than other similarly sized steel watches I've had.

There is no light, so previous reviewers comments on after-hours time checks are accurate. The hands are typical luminescent hands. They hold the light for 20 minutes maybe. You won't be waking up at night to check the time on this time piece, but that's why you have an alarm clock.

The deciding factor for me was the sapphire crystal. It was a must. I'm not one to spend $500 on a watch because I'm very hard on them. A mineral crystal is simply too easily scratched. I liked some of the Citizen designs, but simply won't spend that kind of money for a mineral crystal. For Seiko quality, with a sapphire crystal under $150 this is a steal.  Overall, I'm very happy; 5 stars.

The only reason I rated this as 4 stars is that you can't really see the hour and minute hands in the dark.  I know the description says that the hands are luminescent but they really aren't.  Other than that, the watch looks great - has the right balance of sporty and class

I bought these for my twenty-something sister-in-law... she loved them and put them on right away.  They ARE small, so be aware; she is tiny with delicate features, and usually only wears stud earrings, so they were perfect on her. These would be too small for someone who usually wears larger or flashier earrings.

There is a bit of space between the stones and the metal that doesn't really show in the pictures, but it's nothing you notice once they are on. In all, a great value

These high quality well made earrings are smaller than a dime. The stones continue on the bottom of the earrings, but there are not stones inside the back (in other words they are not an inside/out design). Instead there is a nice scroll design on the backside of the loop. 

I'm very pleased with my purchase. I do wish they were larger or that amazon offered the same earring in a larger hoop size

I honestly wasn't expecting much for $1.99 although I did buy two of them. What a surprise though. Very very nice little bracelets. Very tiny white creamy bead type pearls with irregular shapes that look very good that way and fit on my wrist very easily and look great. I pushed them up my arm a bit so that they fit a little tighter, looks better that way I think. Identical I think as well to what is pictured on the amazon page. I also own expensive pearls and no they aren't as nice as those but for the money it's a sweet somewhat elegant look. Especially when you wear two of them together. And yes they definately are cute and stretchy. Not bad for 5 bucks altogether. It ain't Mikimoto but I am absolutely satisfied.

It lookes very nice on the my thin wrist. But be noticed that the shape of the pearls is irregular. At first I was dissappointed about that. Later on I found that the oval shape of the pearls is actually pretty cute

I love them they are small enough for everyday wear, and people coment on them often about how they like the smaller size and how they have a nice shine to them. I also usally have problems with my ears hurting or getting sore after wearing some earring but not with these and this type of metal defently worth the price

I bought this watch and it really looks cool and feminine. I love the style of the stainless steel band and the pink dial. It can be dressed up or down. 

It goes well with Pink, purple or peach color clothings...or just about anything. 

A definite buy and keep.

I was looking for a nice dress watch or might I say my wife wanted me to look for nicer dress watch.  When I scolled down to the Kinetic Coutura Watch #SNP008 on Amazon's web site, it blew my mind away. I went to a local jewery store and viewed one in person, then ran back and ordered it from Amazon! It's a beautiful watch, very expensive looking, but without the cost!  I was debating between  a Rolex or this Seiko Kinetic Coutura and I choose it, and I'm glad.  It looks just as nice for thousand of dollars less.  If you don't wear it every day it will stop, but I like the way the time and date adjust with just a couple of shakes.  It brings a smile to my face each and everytime I put it on.  I have had numerous compliments from friends and they all guess it cost a couple of thousand dollars.  When I tell them the cost, they can't believe it.  If your looking for a beautiful dress watch, this is it! Amazon's price was the best

Did several days of research and came to this conclusion...  For the watch that I was looking for, I would have to pay somewhere around $1000 and up or I could get the Seiko.  It was a "no brainer" for me at least.

Titanium was the only thing that was missing on my list for the perfect watch.  Owning a Seiko Titanium Kinetic (10 yrs.), I can tell you the importance of having the Sapphire crystal.  The band wore down before the face did (I tend to be a little rough on watches.)

I shopped for many months to replace a twenty year old Seiko.  When I saw the Coutura I knew I had found the replacement.  It has striking looks and state-of-the-art features.  The Coutura is a flawless and accurate timepiece with the look and feel of the finest watches in the world

I really do love this watch and get compliments on it all the time, but just a couple things bothered me that led me to leave a 4 star rating instead of 5.

- My resin strap started cracking within 1 year and I looked high and low in many store and specialty watch shops for a replacement. Turned out that the strap is pretty much custom and no standard Ironman replacement strap would fit it exactly. I had to call Timex customer service to obtain the replacement, so I got 1 extra just in case. I tried to replace the strap by myself, but it was SUPER difficult. Timex used a really tight non-springed pin and I was only able to get one of the pins partially out. I started damaging the metallic casing, so I took it to a watch repair shop to finish what I couldn't complete. The repairman thought it was going to be an easy task, but it wasn't. He said it took a long time to pry the pin out and it broke as he tried to remove it. When he finally got it out, he used a spring-loaded pin instead to make it easier next time. Oh yeah, and he replaced the strap.

- About a week ago I tossed the watch on the kitchen counter and the backplate fell off. I tried to snap it and tap it back in, but in wouldn't  go. Seems like it's a tight fit. Looks like I'll be visiting the watch repair store again.

Other than these two issues, I love this watch. I think most men will enjoy this watch, just be aware that the straps are hard to find... and replace

At first it felt really heavy, but now I don't mind at all, and I like that it feels built like a tank. It's comfortable, really cool looking, and looks like an analog watch, if you want. I've been wanting something like this for a really long time, so I'm glad it exists

I'm an RN and bought this watch mainly for work purposes.  It's stylish and simple, not overly flashy.  Has a convenient second hand which is an essential for me.  The size is perfect, as my wrists are really small and I hate huge watches.  I'd say this face is about the size of a nickel.  The weight is light, making it barely noticable while on but at the same time durable.

My only complaint is that I thought "self adjustable" links meant you can take links out yourself.  Since my wrists are small, every watch I've owned I've had to take to a jeweler to get links taken out.  I bought this watch mainly because of the bonus of self adjustable links.  My husband was finally able to take 4 links out but only after getting a tiny, tiny screwdriver which was noted in the enclosed instructions.  So don't expect these links to just pop in and out as I did.  Other than that, a good value for the price

Today my hus asked me that why I wanted to wear the watch at home?(I usually don't wear watch at home.)I replied that I liked it, and asked him to mind his own business! My hus smiled and walked away. Well, I didn't want to be rude, actually it was the gift from my hus. He has worn a skagen watch for over 10 years. He only changed the batteries, and the watch is still in very good condition. Don't wait! Join skagen club right away

I was pleasantly surprised when I received this watch in the mail, looks much better for real than it does in the pictures. For the price, this watch is hard to beat & is very stylish. Everyone that has seen this black beauty on my hand has complimented my watch (I've had 2 guys offer to buy it from me :-). The only con is that of the 3 mini dials, the one for the day of the month is kinda hard to read... no big deal! Great buy

I was sckeptical of the rubber band, but it looks good and is comfortable.  Like the other reviewer stated the dials on the face are just about useless they are so small, I actually can't even read the time without pausing to count the numbers on the face.  Despite this, the watch is very classy without being overboard like some big gold Rolex or something.  (My watch had red dials instead of the white shown in the picture

A fine looking, elegant, "sporty" watch, very light and comfortable. My only complaint is the sub-dials - the numbers/letters are so tiny as to be just about useless, especially the date dial, with 31 numbers crowded in. That said, though - I like it a lot, and I wear it a lot. My recommendation: check out any watch "live and in person" before you buy it online.

This bracelet is a good width and a good weight.  This is not a piece that goes unnoticed on the wrist.  If you are a woman that likes "big" jewelry this is a nice piece.

I like this bracelet enough that I am planning on purchasing a necklace to wear with this and I am a picky consumer.  This piece is equally nice with jeans or a black suit.

I recommend both this product and this seller.

This was a Valentine's Day present for my daughter, a teacher in Tampa, FL. I haven't seen it on her wrist, yet, but she says that everyone notices it and makes very favorable comments about it. It is shipped in a rich blue velour draw-string jewelry bag which is packed in a very nice box. When my daughter is happy, I'm happy

I Just ordered and received this automatic watch winder (the Garinin model WIN2GR, for two watches) and have used it for about a week (I am using it to wind an Invicta automatic and a Breitling automatic). The unit is pretty well all plastic, and has a "cheap" - yet "solid" - look and feel. Still, it does work as advertised, and this, not appearance, is the primary reason I bought it. So, for the price, I give it one thumb up. A few minor points to note, however. First, I have large wrists, so the removable expanding watch restrainers do not expand enough to restrain the watches securely in their slots. This was remedied by placing two 1" self-adhering felt pads (available at the local hardware store) to the top surface of each restrainer. But this then created a secondary, though less serious, problem: the front door of the winder now does not close all the way (comes to within about " of fully closing). Not a problem unless you live in an exceptionally dusty environment. Second, some reviewers have noted a noise problem with this unit. However, I found that mine runs very quietly. I keep it next to the bed, on the bottom of my nightstand, and on a quiet night I can just barely hear the low purring sound of the motor inside the unit. Even then, you have to really focus your attention in order to hear it, and, in my view, only a picky critic would find this soft noise to be the least bit disturbing. Finally, there is a switch for selecting the direction in which the watches rotate: either clockwise or counterclockwise (they are linked, so both rotate in the same direction at all times). What is not made clear is why the winding direction is important. If my watches are supposed to be wound in only one of these directions, how am I to know which one it is? Furthermore, how do I control the winding direction when I am actually wearing the watches? And finally, what if the Invicta needs to be wound clockwise but the Breitling should be wound counterclockwise? I arbitrarily selected one of the directions and moved on ... both watches still work just fine.

In closing, note that there are some humorous statements in the one-page instruction manual. The unit is identified as a "Time Tutelary" (which name also appears as a logo on the front of the unit pictured in the manual). What is a "time tutelary," anyway? The instructions state, "Please pull off the adapter when the winder is not using," and, "This product provides maintenance or replacement service within one year from the purchasing date." I know what is meant here, but still, this is a case of either poor English or poor translating (or both!). Further to the warranty statement itself, note that there is an outlined box at the bottom of the manual in which is stated, "Invalid without representative's official stamp." The problem is, there is no stamp in the box (or anywhere else for that matter), so the only reasonable conclusion is that there is NO warranty for this product.

I also ordered a second winder, a Garinin single-watch winder, model WIN1BRG, as a present for my son. I mention this to note that the operation manual accompanying this unit states, "Using a timer is recommended with this product. This will ensure that your watch is wound properly and will extend the life of your winder and your automatic watch. On average an automatic watch should be wound four hours a day." (Note that no such statement accompanies the two-watch WIN2GR winder.) First, is this 4 hours-maximum-per-day claim true? And second, if the winder automatically rotates for one hour and then rests for the next three hours, it winds your watch a total of 6 hours per day, so is the extra two hours of winding really all that detrimental to the watch? And, if eliminating those two extra hours of winding each day (by using a timer) will actually "extend the life of your winder," it doesn't seem to say much about the quality and designed-in reliability of the product (not to mention adding to the expense and hassle of ownership).

Bottom line: if you want a quiet two-watch winder that works as advertised, but don't want to spend a lot of money (and don't mind the plastic look), this winder should do the trick.

My wife loves this necklace. It isn't as fancy, as expensive, or with near as many diamonds as some of her others. But it is simple and attractive, and for the price, I would say definitely worth it.

The is perfectly sized, about 2 cm in outside diameter. Every third groove that you see on the picture has a little diamond in it. So, "diamond accented" is a proper description. 

If you, or your significant other, likes simplicity and the looks of this pendant, I recommend that you go for it

It's only a $15 necklace, so I wasn't expecting anything spectacular. The chain is kind of flimsy, but I have other silver chains and I just put it in one of those.

Very cute for a semi-casual night out, lots of people complimented it

I bought this for myself to celebrate a milestone in my life and I couldn't be happier.  Adusting the watch to fit my wrist was simple (contrary to one review - Skagen gives you easy, detailed instructions, but I figured it out before reading the instructions), and I'm already getting many compliments on it.  It looks far more expensive than its price.  And I love that the case is quite slim.  Gorgeous watch!

I've had this watch for 3 yrs, the band is starting to fade a little (though I got a compliment on it just yesterday) and I want to get a new one before they are no longer available.  Great watch, is not water resistant, but it's been wet several times.  I've gotten a little condensation on the inside of the crystal numerous times (I'm a nurse and I wash my hands frequently-yeah, I know, I should have a water resistant watch, but this one is so pretty!), but it's always worked perfectly.  Tons of compliments on it, looks expensive and I can't destroy it with my rough treatment

This is my second Skagen. It's much thinner than my older watch. The 7-year old watch still works perfectly, but I wanted a new treat.

I think this watch is a great in-between of formal and informal. The goldtone really sparkles and the crystals on the face add a touch of elegance. One of the features I like most about the Skagen mesh bands is that they are adjustable. And the Amazon price was great!

I highly recommend this watch.

I bought this for my wife this Christmas (and gave it to her early -- couldn't help myself).  This normally wouldn't have been the kind of thing I picked out for her.  She says I have good taste in jewelry, but I usually choose either diamonds or colored semiprecious stones for her.  This seemed kind of plain from the picture.  Nevertheless, it was on her wish list, so I bought it.

One thing to note is that the pendant is relatively small -- but not too small.  It shows up nicely as long as she's wearing something like a turtleneck or other plain sweater.  It would get lost if she wore a busier pattern.  Also -- and this is my one disappointment with the piece -- it is "one-sided".  In other words, the way it appears in the picture is the way it will appear on the wearer.  You can't turn it around to form a "C" shape.  This is because the back of the pendant is flat, and the filligree is not really visible.  Not a huge deal, though.

A nice piece, overall

Fairly pleased with these. I like the anklet and the bracelet done in this style quite a bit more, but these are not bad at all.

I kind of wished the crystals on the string were flexible such that were a person to move their head they would not always stay in a straight line. I mean don't get me wrong... the earrings dangle and will move. They look to all be mounted on a silver rod, which will swing from the top. Maybe this was done for a reason, but I think they'd look nicer mounted on a loose cord. And for all I know I'd complain about the lack of structure and symmetry.

Anyway... from a damned picky person, these are quite nice

I've had this watch since December 06' and it's working out great! I really like the yellow face, it's my favorite color, and the whole thing is quite sturdy. The only gripe I have with this watch is the fact that it really does go about 5 minutes too fast a week. I really don't mind that though because adjusting the time is quick and easy, takes a few seconds, and then it's done! I would recommend this watch to anyone who doesn't mind adjusting it now and then.

This is a great knock-around watch as well as a great dive watch.  If you're thinking of buying one be awhere that it is an automatic watch, once called autowind watch.  This watch doesn't use a battery and is wound by the movement of your arm.  If you set it down for a couple of days, it will stop.  I guess we're all too use to quartz battery watches to remember the old days of winding watches

I purchased this little Timex as basically a "thrasher watch" for my wife.  The few watches that she owns are relatively expensive and would not hold up during our weekend activities.  It does exactly what it is supposed to do, nothing more nothing less.  This is an excellent low cost timepiece

I bought this for $19.99 as a Gold Box special because of the price. The picture above looks very washed out and does not do it justice. I just received it today and it is absolutely stunning, not washed out like the picture above. I came back here to see what the price was, to perhaps buy more to give for Christmas gifts. At $29.99 it would be worth buying again for myself if I didn't already have it, but since Xmas is so far off I will wait for something similar in the Gold Box and buy 10 of them. The blue is gorgeous. I wish I had gotten it in the purple color as well

Buen producto y a buen costo. Me ha funcionado perfectamente desde que lo adquiri y mantiene mis relojes en hora cuando lo necesito.
No le doy las 5 estrellas porque es plstico y pensaba que la parte gris era de aluminio u otro material.
De todos modos es un buen producto y hace el trabajo, si es comparado con los demas de este tipo que son sumamente caros.

This review is a bit mixed.  While this is a children's silver locket, I ordered it for my mom to wear on her charm bracelet.  When it arrived I was pleased with the quality, it was high polished sterling silver with a small diamond accent, as described.  However, I wasn't at all pleased with the packaging and the front of the heart was scratched, right next to the diamond.  Also the chain was a tangled mess and I can't get the knot out.  Basically it comes in a blue jewelry pouch which would look pretty if there were a small box INSIDE the pouch with the necklace mounted on it.  Instead they just throw the necklace into the pouch.  I am glad I had it shipped to me and not the recipient.  I would have been embarassed for her to get it like this.  They are sending me a replacement and the shipping was free and only two days transit time.  So, if the replacement isn't scratched and tangled, it should be lovely.  Incidentally, I reduced some photos to fit the locket and it should be just adorable once its all put together

This is a watch that is very functional for everyday use. For the money, you cannot beat it. It is easy to use whether in the shower or swimming, and handy to see in the middle of the night or in a movie. Goes with anything and is easy to put on and take off.

I'm very happy with my new watch.  I had to have several links removed from the band by a jeweler, but now it fits perfectly. The style is just right for my casual lifestyle and I like the "silver and gold" combination for coordinating with other jewelry.  And for senior eyes, the numbers on the dial are big enough to read easily

Basically, I was looking for lightweight titanium day/date watch. Seiko is probably (or at least as far I was searching) practically only brand that has these parameters in this price range.
Got a good deal, free shipping (otherwise DHL costs around 30-40$ to Finland). The minus was that Finland's customs, thanks to EU, slammed me 46,01 customs tax bill :( It still costed with taxes for me about 181 compared to Finland's prices: cheaper versions like SGG709 cost here 189-219 and this SGF709 would have costed even more.
To try to be critical - only negative notice about the watch is that seconds dial is not exactly aligned, it is 1/4 of a second behind. So - good but not perfect :

hour/minute/second hands analogue face that is lightweight, sealed and water resistant to withstand slight submersion, has a secure lightweight locking titanium hypoallergenic bracelet, and an easy to read analogue dial with hands that glow in the dark after exposure to light. Titanium is not only lightweight but stronger than steel.

This lightweight dress watch was purchased as an alternative to my heavy Seiko diver's watch still running well after 25 years. The SGF709 has no alarm nor chronograph and there are less expensive models if you don't want a day of the week or second hand. But, I like the weight and features of this model plus my spouse likes the looks; so it was a great purchase

This watch is very smart looking, keeps great time and feels very comfortable on my arm.  The sale made it very affordable, which I really appreciated as I was able to get it with a gift certificate I received for my birthday.  Amazon gift certificates make wonderful gifts.  I have never had a watch this nice in the past.  Thanks to Amazon for prompt delivery and nice product.

i am not a professional cycler so I can't really comment on the quality of this monitor, I only know that it is certaintly enough for an amateur like me; it shows me the heart rate in different displays; with the time or with the our, etc. It has a review feature which shows the calories burned, the average heart rate, etc. I think it's great

I bought this for its affordability and seemingly simple operations and have had good success with it so far.  The heart rate monitor strap that fits around your chest sometimes doesn't read correctly unless there's wetness between the sensors and your skin (water/perspiration) so it can be frustrating at times when you get incorrect readings.  Overall I think it serves its purpose for my heartrate monitoring while training for my triathlon

It's a very good product. It's working really well for me. It gives me an alarm when I'm out of the heart rate zone that I want to work and on the end of my workout I can review my progress, such as avg heart rate, maximum heart rate, time on the zone that I'd choosen and the calories burned during this workout. Beyond this, it has an alarm clock, a time counter, it's water proof. I'm having a very good use of it. I recommend it

I've been in the fitness field for nearly two decades and have considerable experience with heart rate monitors.  This Timex model is worth it's salt and has plenty of features for the money.  It has all the features you'll need as an average exerciser and non of the features you pay too much for and don't use.  Timex rarely has a quality issue and I don't understand the bad experiences some have had here but it happens with all products and brands from time to time.  I recommend this model.  By the way, Polar is over-rated in the industry, charges too much for their products and I have found their batteries don't last long and their products require being sent back to the manufacturer for replacement.  Not user friendly when you can't do it yourself.  Goodluck with your decision.

I am extremely impressed with the feel, look and general quality of the watch.  It contains the Citizen Miyota 21 jewel automatic movement that is a true workhorse for a fraction of the price.  The comfortable stainess steel pinned link bracelet is worth the price of the watch. It has rounded flexible brushed steel wrist links The foldover adjustable double safety clasp uses pins as well. Can easily be mistaken for a watch costing much more.  The Mineral Glass crystal is scratch resistant - but not as good as a sapphire watch face, but is less prone to chipping or shattering than a sapphire crystal. The display watchback is also mineral glass - displaying the undecorated Miyota automatic movement. It look as stylish and run as well as my other watches, and, I receive as many comments if not more from the Invicta's.  It is a great looking watch!  Good value, accurate and stylish if you like the Sub' look. This is a good day-to-day knock about watch that still looks better than the quartz stuff in the same price range. If it lasts 5 years it's more than paid for itself.  If you would like more information and talk with others about Invicta's  or other watches visit www.thewatchcentral.com.  All questions and comments will be responded to

How can you do better than this?  The bracelet is shiny and the watch face is the prettiest I have ever seen.  All made by the Seiko Co.  The band was the right length and it is the bargain of the century.  I got this watch and another Lorus work of art for $11, which is just extraordinary!

I had a rubber cord just like this one before, but it got damaged. I liked it so much that I had to get another one. I've bought several items from Silver Insanity and I must say that I'm really happy and impressed with the service. I ordered the rubber cord and two other items on the same day and Silver Insanity combined the order for me (without realizing it, I had placed the orders separately) saving me 15 dollars

I've had this watch for 4-5 years and it's been great.  I paid almost 400 for it then.  The only thing I've needed to do is change the battery this past summer.  Some of the gold tone has worn off in a few places on the band, but this is normal for the age of this watch.  
I've used it scuba diving, swimming (salt and fresh), snow skiing, and working on the car (most punishment yet).  I've slammed the face into brick walls and metal railings without a problem (not on purpose).  I would recommend this watch/brand to anyone interested.

I'll preface this by saying that my tastes run toward higher-end jewelry.  I bought this as an inexpensive surprise gift for my wife, as she likes things like this.  She loves it!  She's received numerous compliments on it, and wears it often.  It does look better in real life than it does in the picture, as it does a good job reflecting the light.  It arrived promptly, and was enclosed in a small but secure package

I bought this watch some time ago and my 9-year old loves it.  The design of the watch is interesting...instead of a second hand, its a clear circular plastic disc with gecko designs on it, so that as it turns, the geckos rotate around the watch face.  Some months after I bought it, that disc must have loosened and came off.  I emailed ProSport Watches and they sent a new watch together with a postage paid envelope for me to return the old one in - what an outfit!  The new one works fine and my daughter was delighted all over again

Again, a watch without acknowledging movement maker. Has day/date and sizing is a breeze. This is a heavy watch and keeps good time. The price for a Fossil at under $40.00 is a steal.Easy to read, only during lighted conditions. Has a double safety clasp, not found on cheaper watches. A bargain at this price.

I have owned several of these watches, currently have and are using two of them. I have abused them to no end and the only thing that seems to do them in is when the battery finally gives out. (I have had mixed luck with keeping them working AFTER replacing the battery. Could be the technical abilities on my end...) I am active outdoors and have worn my watch: horseback riding (daily), swimming, ran it through the wash cycle, dropped it, and struck the doorjamb with my wrist/watch face as I was walking through it. These watches are a classic style with Timex quality--this model truly "takes a licking and keeps on ticking" and I highly recommend it for anyone with an active lifestyle.

I bought this watch because it was inexpensive and had an alarm. It continues to be my favorite watch. 

I wondered if the band would hold up to wear and tear.  It has held up well showing little wear or dirt. 

I bought it in blue and it matches many colors surprisingly well.  It keeps perfect time, the alarm is reliable and I get compliments on how it looks.  It is not like the usual alarm sport watch  that is bulky and ugly. 

I have even forgotten to change it and even had it on with dress clothes. Any other sport watch I would have taken off and hidden away but I wore this one anyway.

This watch is a great bargain

These earrings are beautiful! Very delicate tho, right when I received them I put them on and they broke! But that's ok because the wonderful seller (CoolStyles) said they would send me a new pair and sure enough in todays mail were my earrings!!! They look and sparkle just like real diamonds! And you cant beat the price for sterling silver, they actually look like white gold! So lets review....$8.99 for beautiful, sterling silver diamond look-a-likes, fast shipping, and GREAT sellers that go out of their way to make a customer happy! OH!! And they come in a very pretty satin zip pouch! HIGHLY RECOMMEND SELLER!! You cant go wrong

I purchased the watch as a birthday present for my fiancee. She absolutely loves it! The face is pink (which is her favorite color) and the face is big enough to read without being too large. The watch is subdued enough to wear daily and dressy enough to wear on special occasions. Truly a Perfect Present!

Atomic watches are highly-accurate quartz watches which are synchronized each day with a time signal broadcast from the definitive U.S. Atomic Clock in Ft. Collins, Colorado. Thus, all atomic watches are always accurate to within a fraction of a second at any time. Since atomic watches adjust automaticaly to and from daylight saving time they are the ultimate in accurate watches. Casio makes -- and Amazon sells -- a wide selection of styles of atomic watches to suit various needs and tastes, but all are equally accurate. The Casio G-Shock series is especially rugged and the solar powered models, such as this, never require battery replacement. Atomic accurary, solar power, and G-Shock ruggedness is an appealing combination at a quite reasonable price

This is a solid watch, it is bulky and if you are like me and wear polo shirts a lot thats not a problem, but with the dress shirts i do opt for a different timepiece.  It was set to the right time when i got it..I actually bought it because of friend of mine who just got back from IRAQ told me about the quality and it it can live up to that standard i am sure it can take the punishment i will give it.  Awesome i will never have to set the time or change a batter

Great watch x trainnig specially for running since is very light and easy to use. Unfortunatelly is the 3rd one (yes 2 mine and 1 of my son) that lets watter in while in the pool/beach (light swiming or playing with the kids). It seems like IT IS NOT watter ressitant. On the first one I tought it was "bad luck", but after 3...
I still think is the best one outhere and actually just order 2 more to replace the recent cassualties (x my son and myself), but it would be nice if you can tell TIMEX to "correct" their insulation problem. 
Thank you, fc

I bought the watch in Dec and have gone on many long runs where I needed to keep a constant pace.  This watch is perfect for determining the pace at the mile markers.  It's intuitive and very easy to use.  Getting the data out is a little more difficult, but doable.  I highly recommend it for runners

It get's 4 stars because, well what would you expect, the slide rule is accurate to 2 decimal places. And it could have given you 3. Oh well. If you are using your watch to calculate your arrival time you probably don't really care if you are off by a few minutes.

Ok, why is a circular slide rule cool? First, lots of common calculations are really just ratios. Kilometers to miles or statue miles to nautical miles, pounds to Kilograms's. This watch has the markers in the slide rule, so you just align one mark with the number you want to convert and look at the number that the other unit of measure is over and there you are. You do have to keep track of the magnitude of the answer but that's not hard. You can do sq roots but it's a pain. Basic multiplication and division is easy. Doing the approximation for a tip at restraunt, just set the percentage over the "10" mark, and look for you bill at the inside ring, read the tip on the outside ring. No need to even adjust the watch. You can easily set it up before dinner. Note: if you stare at your watch while trying to read the tip value, you may get called "rude" by your date! Better to just overestimate...

Downside, if you do not have perfect vision, you'll have a hard time reading the sliderule. Don't even think about doing this while you are driving. My eyes are fine with it in good light.

On the other hand, the time hands and numerals are plenty large enough and easy to read. The luminescent marks seem to stay bright for about an hour, which is good enough for us casual night hawks. Otherwise you need a watch that has tritium and who knows whether that will pass airport security these days.

One other thing is that the 24 hr inner hand can be easily obscured by the main watch hands. So this feature not very handy as a second timezone clock. It will help you remember the military time, but at say 11:00 you can't see the underlying hand. Not a big thing, and I suppose if you set to say 8 or 9 hours difference it might be more visible.

All in all, a cool watch, even if the slide rule control is built for a lefty

I purchased this watch for my 22 year old son for Christmas. He is graduating from the UofA soon and will make his way out into the business world following graduation. He told me that he would like to have a "nice" watch now. This was quite an unusual request coming from him. As I love watches myself, I decided it had to be very special, so he would love, wear and take care of it! I must have looked at a hundred different watches and even actually purchased another brand at Sears, only to return it. I finally settled on this sweet baby. It really looks great on the wrist. It is a very handsome, heavy and distingushed piece of stainless steel. I was so impressed with this watch, I plan to get one for myself...

I recieved them today and I love them!! I agree totally with the previous reviewer.  Couldn't wait for them to get here and I cannot wait to wear them tomorrow!  They match a pair of peridot studs that I had ordered from Jewelsforme through Amazon, as well as a pair of leverback blue topaz earrings I have.  (I have many holes in my ears) Highly reccomend these earrings!

I actually bought these earrings as a gift, but I think I might order a second pair for myself.  These earrings are the perfect size, not too small, but still very feminine looking. The gemstones sparkle and are very eye catching and the gold is the perfect compliment.  You will not be sorry for this purchase.

My girlfriend Eunice gave me this watch for my birthday, and was surprice because the first time i saw it i told her that i like it, and i never imagine that she was going to buy it for me, i love her and i love it.
Well the watch looks great, is nice, the fund colors are nice and you can set it with one of the two colors RED or BLACK, or set it with the two colors, every three seconds switch of colors.
I recomended this watch to anyone.
11 yeasr of warranty

I got this watch for my boyfriend and he seemed to like it. Note, he is not a 'suit and tie' man so it went w/ his overall casual style. I got exactly what I expected apart from the fact that the 'red tint' portrayed in the picture actually fades in and out w/ a black background. In other words, it does not look red all of the time. There might be a way to program this so that it does, but neither of us have bothered looking into it yet

This is a great watch.  I have a small wrist and it fits my wrist perfectly,
though it could be used on a wrist of any size. It's an attractive watch that
can be used every day and also when your dressed up. For the money it can't be beat!

I received this as a gift about 8 months ago and am happy with everything about it--the size, the style, the color of the face, the polished silver finish, and the timekeeping. The quality is excellent. My favorite thing about it is the face--it is such a beautiful light pink color with a mother-of-pearl sheen to it, and the diamond at the 12 is the perfect touch

Was looking for a rather tiny watch for my small 5 1/2" wrist.  Another customer's review giving the measurements of the face/case was very helpful. It would be extremely helpful if the measurements were included in the description of all watches posted.  This would save the customer time and money should they have to return a watch because it wasn't the size that they expected. Otherwise, watch is keeping accurate time

This watch is very nice. It goes will with a dress or a pair of jean. However, this watch is VERY TINY, the diameter of this watch is LESS than 20mm (including the stainless ring) and it's exactly 15mm for the diameter of the dial, so if you have a middle to large wrist (you probably want to go for a different watch, because big wrist (sadly, which i am) and this watch just don't go together!) I wish Amazon had indicated that little detail on the watch information before i brought this watch. Anyway, another thing is that the pink color on the dial, it's NOT light pink like i was expecting/hoping. It's more like a milky light peach pink, I can't even describe the color, i think it's kinda of a strange pink. (maybe it's just the watch I receive or something, i am not sure about that).Overall, i still think this is a nice watch, which i think it truly deserves a 4 stars at the current price they are selling.

This is a beautiful, classy casual watch without a lot of gaudy embellishments. Can work for dressy occasions or casual. It has a high polish finish, not a matte finish. The bracelet is narrow and dainty without being too delicate. The case and bracelet are heavy and high quality. The face has a diamond at '12', metal markers at the other 3 quadrants, and a nice little white dot at the intermediate hours to make this easy to read. Note, no second hand or date.

Came in nice presentation box with US warranty (some other dealers may not provide authorized warranty).

At $65 (price paid at Amazon) this is a real bargain. Same watch is $129 at BlueNile

These earrings look much nicer in person. They are lovely, rich-blue and sparkly topaz stones. They have polished, and substantial white gold settings.These are not too small and not too large. Just right for every day.The price is excellent too! It was packaged extremely well. Apart from the exterior packaging the earrings were enclosed inside a felt jewelry box which was within another gift box.This was my first jewelry puchase from Amazon. I was not disappointed and will look for other jewelry needs from Amazon in the future :)

A solid good looking watch for those who like or need databank function.  I like having my phone numbers on the watch even though I use my cell phone directory more. You can store other data involving names/numbers as well (i.e. birthdays) Overall very satisfied yet some issues are as follows: 

(1) No second hand.
(2) Multiple alarms are nice and snooze feature is nice yet alarm tone is a little quiet if you're a deep sleeper.
(3) Backlight is not that great. You need to look hard to see the time. Definitely can't use if driving and want to glance quickly at time.
(4) Databank has 2 pages which have to be scrolled back and forth.
(5) Watch is heavier than the databank/calculator it replaced. Much more stylish though.

I would recommend highly and am looking to buy another one in a different color.  At $20-$30 this watch is a great purchase

Looking for tiny studs for second holes?  These are probably what you are looking for.  They're gold so they won't irritate sensitive ears like the cheap versions the kids always buy. Good price, boxed individually, so you could share them around if you were so inclined.  However since they are small, the prongs can get "pokey" if you sleep on them.

This is a great gift. There is an area for two photos. I gave it to my wife with a photo of myself and my son in it in black and white. She loved it! It was sort of hard to get the photos in, but worth the time. My only complaint is that the locket piece has a tendency to fall off of the chain, but that can be fixed

These earrings dangle about an inch below the earlobe and sparkle prettily as you move.  They are so lightweight that you don't feel them at all.  I purchased them on a Friday sale for $49 and am very pleased with the quality and value.  Handle these earrings very gently, though, as they are quite delicate

This watch is almost perfect. All Casio needs to do is add a light. The dial does glow for a few minutes after exposure to light but not well enough to rely on it when you are really in the dark. Great style though. All other features are wonderful.

I bought my first Casio Divers Watch in 1999 to use in my job as a police ofcr working road patrol. This watch is super tough. I liked the idea of the large easy to read analog dial, and the smaller digital readout that I set to military time as that is what is used for work.

The crystal is pretty good at minimizing scratches. Battery replacement is a little less than two years. Super dependable watch, and tough. Mine have gone through fights, and monthly firearms practice. I never had a single hiccup from any of the two I've worn for work. The watchband does seem to breakdown quickly and will develop cracks and then tear. However, I just replace it with a generic black leather one at a nominal cost.

I'm ordering two more, and am so glad they are still being produced

This is a long-standing standard for a solidly designed well-priced diver's watch.  I have owned this model of watch for several years. The only reason why I get a new one is because my old one gets too beat up from scratches and the like, but not because of any failure.

The mineral crystal is superior for resisting scratches and so much more quality than a cheap plastic type. The stainless steel case looks good and offers rugged protection for the internal components. I have never had a situation where water leaked into the internal part of the watch.

You get the best of both types of displays (analog and digital).  I put the dual time function to use when I travel overseas and don't want to readjust the analog display.

This is a no-brainer if you are in the market for a diver's style watch

This watch has and does everthing, us men need.  Not only does it look kool but it provides a digital and analog display to tell time.  The digital part and wrist band provides the "Sport" look and the Analog with cumpus provides the "casual" look, so therefore you get the best of both sides.

This is an excellent buy for a father, brother, or boyfriend who love a great watch.  If you are looking for something to buy for a love one consider this, its well worth the money

This box is great for the budding watch collector, but be aware that larger men's watches like Seiko Monsters and Tuna Cans, or anything 40mm+ don't fit well in this box. They can be accommodated by storing them loose in a compartment without a pillow, but that tends to defeat the appeal of a storage system of this type. For more average-sized men's and women's timepieces, it's an excellent choice, and the quality is much better than expected at this price point

I have been looking for this exact watch for the past year after the same model that I have had since 1980 died. This watch should last me as long as my first watch that I used to scuba dive in Guam, Spain,The Red Sea, Palua, Japan, Thailand,and several other areas around the world. I have had this watch on as Aircrew on Navy planes for over 6000 flight hours. It has been dropped and banged around more than any watch needs to be and it only failed after 25 years of near constant use. Hope they still make this model in 2031 when I will need it's replacement

What a pretty little necklace. This necklace also comes in Peridot, which I will purchase as well. The stones are beautiful, they really sparkle. They are described as light blue, but they are more a light swiss blue and very vibrant. The chain is fine, but NOT superfine. There are 8 stones stationed set in this necklace. It gives off a lot of sparkle, all around every portion of the front and sides of your neck. It's a lot of "look" for such a dainty, but strong necklace. It matches perfectly with the Swiss Blue Topaz Teardrop Earrings also in the Amazon Collection. The earrings are dainty too, so the look together is balanced.                                                                                                                          This set would be perfect for a bride or anyone who likes really feminine jewelry with a big look.  It is presented in a beautiful midnight blue suede box that is contained in a midnight blue gift box.  The presentation is quite classy looking. No cheap, flimsy gift box, here. You'd feel proud to give this as a gift--like I did--to myself.  Amazon.com always delivers well ahead of their estimated delivery date. This is the fourth piece of jewelry I've ordered from the Amazon collection. I'm very pleased with Amazons collection of jewelry, I'm really liking it. Its priced very well and the quality is even better than I expected from them. Each piece was delivered to me, one day after I received notification of shipment.  I  appreciate the free supersaver shipping.  Thanks again Amazon

The kit is great if you only need to start doing simple repairs and I really mean simple. Don't start pulling springs etc out unless you really know what you are doing and if that was the case you probably would be using more sophisticated and accurate tools anyway. It is a great case for us "want to be " watch maker/repairers. It can soon cover the cost of band repairs and battery replacements by doing it yoursel

At first I thought I was sent the wrong watch because the gold is such a light color-- not at all the brassy gold in the picture. I even went back to my order to make sure it was filled correctly.  When I sat at my computer, near the window, to investigate my order further I saw that the gold was in there, but it is a VERY subtle color gold. I actually like this gold better than the overwhelming gold shown in the picture. I am giving it to my daughter today for her 30th birthday. I hope she loves it as much as I.

My girlfriend loves diamonds and pearls (has quite a few of both, and very nice pieces at that).  I looked through for something to get her for Valentine's day (2007) and of all the items on Amazon this struck my fancy.  It's not her usual fair (white gold, lots of diamonds, old-fasioned pearls, etc) but I just thought it looked very pretty and young/playful.  I took a risk and got her this.

She loved it right when she first got it.  She said it looked to be of decent quality (important, since you can't tell from a picture), and has commented several times on how sparkly the topaz are.  She is not a fan of cubic-zirconia (too sparkly and fake) and loves diamonds (very sparkly).  So this is a good thing.  The blue was also a good color.  I don't know if it matches the picture well, only that she liked it.

The diamonds are tiny and almost not worth it.  I'm not too worried about that, as they add a little bit and are not the focus.  Mainly I thought it to be a well balanced and colorful bracelet.

Definitely recommended

In person this lovely necklace looks even better than the pictures.  It is larger than it looks on the site but it is very striking and looks great on.  However, the ring that it comes with to wear is VERY tight - plan on taking the pendant off the ring and wear it with your own chain.  

It is definitely worth the money, especially since the price dropped

I have received more compliments on this one piece--from *everybody*, even people who don't usually exhibit interest in jewelry or wardrobe--than I have on any other pendant I own.  It is large, but the elongated rectangle shape coupled with the airspace inherent in the design helps to make it not appear too large.  I am petite and I don't have any problems pulling it off.  It's bold, but not aggressive--it has a gentleness, and though it's very contemporary, it has a primitive organic quality.  It looks much more expensive than it is, too--a real *piece of jewelry.*  And I like the neckwire--the pendant never hangs crazy on me and the clasp stays at the back of my neck where it belongs, and it looks graceful on, even with my short neck

Great watch, chunky but if you don't know that you are buying the wrong watch in a g-shock.

Good fit for a wrist that is too big for most standard bands.

Two dings, the hour hand is painted red and not that noticable in low light situations and the first time I wore it in the jacuzzi it reset the whole watch.

To illuminate the second comment, when I got out of the hot tub all the lcd's were blank and the hands were pointing straight up.  I thought I would have to send the watch back.  The next morning it was functioning normally and I've had it in the same and other tubs, showers and pools since.

Great watch, only problem is since the first problem I never know when it will fail again.

FWIW

I was worried because I read the other review after the earrings were already purchased for me and on their way, but when I received them, I was very happy.  Mine really are glass and not plastic and I think they look exactly like the picture.  Every time I have worn them so far I have received a compliment on them.  I am glad that I got them.

This watch as I said, has an excellent design. The size is enough, not too big, not too small.
And for a soccer fan like me it's handy when timing the first and second half.
However, when I got the item, there was no instructions in the box, I had to look for them at Fossil web page, and even so, they're a little bit confusing

Looks like a very expensive watch at only a fraction of the cost. Very classy looking and has all the features of the cheaper appearing watches such as a timer an alarm. Gold and silver contrast each other without looking tacky and the blue face is subtle. Definitely a great bargain

Really, there is nothing more to be said. Do you want some more? Okay, here's the description :two dragons, intertwined with a seal of Solomon in the middle. This necklace is so unique that you are almost guaranteed to be the only one wearing it anywhere except maybe a huge city like New York or London. The detail is exquisite, it looks custom made and the metal looks much more expense than what it is. It honestly looks like something that a medieval mage might had worn. Bravo Silver Insanity!!! This company does amazing work and all should visit its vast selection

I've had this watch for around 18 months now. It's tough, looks good and doesn't have a mark on it yet. It loses out in two places though. Firstly, it has remarkably short "standby" time. Take it off early on a Friday night and then sleep late on Saturday and it's more than likely to have stopped. Take it off for a day to alternate with a dress watch and there's no chance it'll still be going. Secondly - I've been spoiled by electronic watches and not having to adjust the date at month end on 28 and 30 day months so that's a pain. On the other hand, the ripoff prices I have to pay to have the battery in my Citizen changed (along with the mandatory water seal testing) make it well worth the hassle

Had the watch for over a year now. Great design and durable as hell. A little big with dress shirts and runs a little fast. I guess this is normal for automatic watches. This watch is my go to choice for daily wear. Loads of compliments. Basic design, tough, classy. What more could you want out of affordable quality watch. Will buy others in other colors

Works as good or better than my Rolex and Omega watches. I am now certain that Swiss watchmakers are ripping us off by charging thousands for just stamping their name on automatic watches that are marginally superior in fit and finish to this Seiko. For the few weeks that I have been wearing it, it has performed flawlessly. Bravo Seiko

Nice watch, waterproof, never need to mess with a battery like some of my others ie. 2 Tag Heuer's that currently have dead batteries and sitting in my safe.  Then after you change the battery for $50+ a year later it's dead again.  No more batteries for me!  I got a couple Rolex's but they're not appropriate to wear in some of the circles I travel in, unless I want to ask for trouble.  Plus, I bought the wife a Rolex she hardly wore because she was afraid of messing it up ($4k), then it broke and cost $580 to fix!  I got a Suunto that's not bad, plus solar powered Citizen that's good, and some others.  I've taken this watch on some abusive situations like land clearing, chain-sawing wood, lighting 2 acres on fire (controlled burn), construction, and playing lots of piano, stride piano too, so lots of movement, AND not a single SCRATCH, zero.  It will run a couple minutes fast after a while but no big deal.  Lights up great after being exposed to sun, way better that a Rolex or Tag, the only watch to light up better one handed is one I own with Tritium, the radioactive stuff on the dial & hands, but then again the battery is dead, and after changing it a couple time, it's no longer water-proof, it leaked water while diving and now is junk?  Waste of $200.  This Seiko is still on my wrist and haven't had the urge to buy anymore watches, which is a good thing!  No regrets!  It's a keeper

Quick, what's the difference between a higher end Citizen watch and a Tag or Omega or a Rolex?  Price!  Not only is the Citizen watch made to incredibly high standards but it looks outstanding and never needs a battery and all this for a fraction of the price the other watches.  Even with the Citizen price increase on December 1 of last year the Calibre 2100 Titanium and other Citizen models in this price range are ridiculously under-priced.  I currently own four Citizen Eco Drive solar watches and three of them are Titanium models.  I own the gold toned stainless steel Moon Phase watch, the Titanium Nighthawk, Titanium Skyhawk, and the Calibre 2100. They are all superb but I must say that the 2100 is the most impressive of the bunch. The 2100 is also easy to read and operate. So  while my James Bond Omega Seamaster watch sits in a drawer waiting for me to find the time to send it for expensive repairs and my wife's Rolex loses time, my Citizen watches just keep on trucking along!!!

I choose this watch out of all watches under $600 on the web. I have not been disappointed. It is large, solid, and light weight thanks to the titanium. It is one of the nicest watches Citizen makes. The alarm is usable and stopwatch feature is great. The Tachymeter will not do any good unless you are timing something over a hundred miles per hour, but no big deal. Great Watch!

I was looking for a replacement for a casio digital watch which I had for a long time, and felt like getting something I could keep for a while. This watch is seriously better looking in person than the picture given online, and you will not be dissatisfied. It came about 1/4 charged, and took a little more than a week for it to go to full and stay there. It's very easy to read, and I was surprised that it had an alarm on it. It is not the loudest, but still is enough to wake me up in the morning. The titanium band is pretty slick looking, and feeling. I pretty much agree with all the other reviews. Purchasing this watch is one of the best presents I ever got for myself :

The color is vibrant.  It hasn't dulled yet. 

Looking at the chain i could not find any imperfections.

It is very small and very light, hardly noticeable on the skin...just what i wanted.

Exactly what I wanted

Ok let me be honest, never wanted to be a pilot(ok maybe a Blue Angel pilot), don't really care about all the functions on the dial; this watch just looks good!  Love it!  Reviews of being to big or heavy scared me a bit, not the case.  This watch screams quality, I've had several comments on it.  Little confusing to set at first, but fine once you get the hang of it. Definitely love the watch for look and quality, backlight is fine when you need it.  Very happy with my purchase

I bought this watch for my deployment to Iraq as a stand-in for my Breitling B-1. Although there's no real comparison between the two for technology and quality of design and manufacture, I will say that the Pulsar is a reasonable substitue in the more austere conditions of Iraq. It's display is a bit dim as mentioned elsewhere but it is still very readable. The alarm is rather quiet. Other functions work as one would expect and I particularly like the one-time alarm function. It looks good on the wrist and keeps reasonable time. I recommend it, particularly with it's low price

From the pool, to the bike, to the run; this watch does it all.  Even when not racing this watch is a great daily wear and easy to navigate through all the options.
Multiple time zones and alarms make it easy as a traveler's watch and fits small wrists nicely

I just purchased my second of these watches (my first being a stainless steel Skyhawk model), and am smitten with these watches, but realistically see the few drawbacks to them.

First, a few selections from the long list of pros.  This watch is extremely durable, and can definitely stand up to the bumps and bruises of daily life.  I've worn this watch everywhere, from work to the gym to the airplane to the beach, and the only time it stopped was when I submerged it in briny sea water, and water somehow got into the watch itself.  It was repaired under warranty, with no problems or questions.  The Eco-Drive power supply is great- save for the rare malfunction or mishap, it doesn't need to be changed.  It'll keep itself fully charged on the fluorescent lighting that we all have at work, or if that fails, it'll charge itself fully within three or four hours of direct sunlight.

The multiple time zone functions are very handy for someone who travels frequently, as I do.  You can simply set another time zone in the digital display, and with the simultaneous pressing of the two buttons on the side of the watch, it'll switch the time displays between the digital and analog displays.  This function is very handy if you're more than one time zone away from home- when I'm traveling in Europe, it's very convenient to be able to tell the time at home with a simple glance as opposed to the mental gymnastics of calculating the time difference.  The slide rule on the crown is also very useful if you want to calculate the arrival time of your flight, or as an amateur pilot, to figure out the amount of fuel you'll use on your flight.  Again, all very useful.

Now, the cons- the watch is large.  I mean, BIG.  If you like large watches, as I do, that's actually a pro, but some people don't really go for that style.  Also, in anything other than the titanium, it's rather heavy too.  There's no forgetting that you have a watch on, although you get used to its heft rather quickly.  Another con would have to be the (sometimes) complex methods of changing the times.  You can't simply pull out the crown and turn, you have to select the correct time zone in the digital display.  It's very precise (which is the upside of this feature), but it's a little time-consuming.  However, it's pre-programmed with Daylight Savings Time, so when the time comes to change the clocks, that's just a simple push of a button.  It just takes a little getting used to, but once you do, you'll never wear another watch.

In conclusion, I'd like to reiterate that this watch is a great timepiece, one that I've just duplicated in my collection (the first watch is my wedding gift, and I can't bear to scratch it again).  I highly recommend this watch to anyone

These earrings are so perfect I have no plans to take them out. I had been shopping for tiny hoop earrings for at least a year, but I never saw what I wanted. Everything I examined was too big or  looked like it would hurt when I slept in them or they'd get caught on the towel when I dried my hair. Recently, I thought of looking at childrens' earrings and began my search with Amazon, not really expecting to find anything. I ordered these on a chance; things rarely look the same in hand as they do online, but the return policy was generous (no 20% restocking fee). Less than a week later, I received earrings that are remarkably sturdy for their diminutive size, were barely noticeable when I slept, and did not snag on the towel.

The only negative aspect to the endless hoop design is that they were incredibly hard to put in with my big, adult fingers! I spent almost 15 minutes struggling on my own until I enlisted a helper. But they are now snugly in place and look perfect. Wish these were available in white gold or platinum

I looked pretty extensively for a Christmas present for my mom. She loves silver dangle earrings, but I kept finding earrings that looked cheap or boring. However, these earrings look wonderful (even better in person) and appear to be great quality. They feel very solid, unlike some earrings I looked at. They shipped very quickly and I was surprised how nice they were for the price

I haven't worn a watch in years. I wanted to purchase something to go with my business casual dress that would not be too overpowering and still be nice. I had been eyeing this watch for awhile and finally decided to splurge.

The watch seemed to be a bit too flashy for me when wearing blue jeans and t shirts, but that ok with me. The latch seemed to be a little bit tricky at first. Once I read the users manual and figured out how to use it I was ok.

The reason for writing this article was for its durability. I took it on vacation but didn't want to wear it through security checkpoints. I decided I would stick it in a sock and just check the bag. Once I did this and got home I decided I would wash all of my laundry. Of course I forgot and left the watch in the sock. It goes through the washer and dryer, comes out still ticking. No scratches or anything. I'm impressed

This is a very attractive watch - much nicer than the picture depicts. It has a deep blue sunburst dial (much like another Skagen shown on Amazon). It is very slender and the band is a standard double latch design. The band is very easy to adjust(takes a couple of minutes at most).

Besides being accurate (as expected) it has a lot of detail in the dial, (e.g. chrome around the date window) and is easy to view in all lighting situations. But it does not have a light. The large face and numbers on the dial make viewing very easy. Highly recommended

The watch is great, after reading parts of the manual I found there is a low power indicator.  When the second hand moves two seconds at a time the watch is low on power.  I do like the watch, I have two other watches that need batteries ... they are sitting on my dresser (still needing a battery).  I would highly recommend the watch it is a very good value, worry free (no battery to replace) and I think it looks great.  The hour and minute hands are large so they are easy to see

2.I was concerned about the solar battery power. The watch does not get exposed to much sunlight as most of my weekdays are spent inside the office or home. But it has not lost its power so far, looks like it will work fine with tubelight exposure. 

BAD:

1. The watch band pulls my hair. It really gets into my nerve when I am driving or immersed in my work. 

2. It would be nice to have some kind of battery power indicator.
 
3. No perpetual calendar. You have to change the date once for every non-31 day months. And you cannot change it from 9pm to 6am something like that. Weird.


Will not buy it for $275 original price

It looks and performs just as described.  Glow in the dark is good (I prefer an indiglo-type technology though) and the titanium keeps it light.  The only thing that I wanted in this watch that is missing is a little more bulk to it.  It's got a slim profile that was hard to see by the pics, but if that isn't a preference for you then it's no biggie

I previously bought a Citizen Eco-Drive Blue Angels Skyhawk stainless steel digital/analog watch. It was beautiful to look at but hard to read because of the busy dial and the very low contrast digital LCD subdials. I returned the watch and bought the Corso.

Two things about this watch attracted me: (1) the light weight of the titanium case and bracelet, and (2) the easy-to-read dial. I can quickly and easily read off the time, date, and day of the week on this watch. With the Skyhawk, this wasn't possible without reading glasses. 

The bracelet deserves special mention. It does come with a locking pin, and it integrates nicely with the watch case. The titanium finish of the bracelet is unusual. Parts of it are in a brushed/matte metal finish (typically seen in titanium watches), and other parts of the links are highly polished. This makes the bracelet very attractive, but I am wondering whether the titanium bracelet might actually be a combination of stainless steel and titanium.

All in all, this is a great watch at a very attractive price.

Great product! Free shipping (&lt;5 days). I love this watch. I bought another for a Christmas present. $100 less than any jewelry store. Just visit a store, write down the model nimber, and definitely buy from this site (at least $25 cheaper than any other site I found)

This really is good-looking watch. Unlike other bracelet watches I have had, this one does not snag the hair on my arm. The face is slightly smaller than most standard mens watches, which makes a good fit for me because I'm thin. The matte color and dark gray face give a very tasteful look that works for just about any occasion, either dressy or casual.
I liked this watch so much that when I lost the original one I replaced it with the exact model. (I bought the original about 3 years ago in a department store for about $240.)

I've had this watch for roughly 7 years now, and while I absolutely love the look and feel of the watch, I have had to take it to the repair shop at least 5 times over the past 3 or 4 years.

I wear this watch every day, and have taken it in the water and hot tob with me.  The markers (1-12) have continuously popped out, and I have needed to take it to the shop to have them glued back in place (usually under $10).

I plan to buy a second watch to have just in case this happens as I hate being without a watch

I bought this about 5 years ago to have as an every day watch that would look nice. I never had a waterproof watch before, so this has been great! I wear it playing ultimate and sailing. If it gets sweaty, just run it under water and dry it off! Has a few scratches, but still looks great

This is a great, minimalistic watch geared towards those looking for a watch as a fashion accessory. I've received numerous compliments on it, and its slim profile and neutral color make it go great with literally anything.

I've had this for two months now and have yet to see any scratches appear. The timekeeping is accurate (or at least accurate enough that I haven't had to change it yet, except for DST). The double clasp is also very easily adjustable and holds the watch on one's wrist very well.

You won't find a better image-conscious watch for this price.

This watch is quite nice and makes a fashion statement on any arm.  However, the band leaves a little bit to be desired.  While it is an attractive band, it is not as functional as expected.  It does not wrap around the arm securely without turning a bit sideways and showing a bit of the end of the band.  While this is not a severe problem, it is not 100% acceptable

As usual with Amazon it shipped quickly and was half price of the expensive Dept. stores. I love everything about it and have recieved lots of comments about it. The only negative thing I will say it is hard to read day and night.

P.S. It is also very quiet....I have had it for a month and now just listened to it to see if you could even hear it tick

I loved the packaging of this item.  The box was big enough that no one could tell I was receiving jewelry.  They were placed in a small, black bag, completely protected from any damage.  I loved them when I finally opened the bag, and couldn't wait to wear them.  I was immediately given complements at work about my new earrings.

There have been alot of complaints on amazon about similar pieces.  It is very small but no smaller than 14mm as the add states.  I like it small because cameos tend to be a bit gawdy.  I did not get one with diamonds, just plain silver for my mother's gift on valentine's day.  The agate is slightly raised from the setting but does not appear to be a problem, and the design is intricate and nice.  The ring on the pendant could be a little stronger but I think it will be ok.  The chain is very nice and strong.  It arrived on time and I live in Japan.  We love everything with angels on them, we even have a pet or a mutt named Angel.  :-)  I paid $34.00 plus $5.00 shipping and handling and I am ok with that

I agree that the wings are on the transparent side and hard to see, but isn't that what Fairy wings look like?

It was just what I expected with a Disney watch and I am very pleased.  It arrived even quicker than expected.  No regrets at all

I was a bit hesitant about buying this watch as a replacement for my stainless Fossil I've had for many years, but after wearing it for awhile now I'm really happy about the purchase. I'd read that the watch is difficult to read in all but perfect conditions, but I found this to be completely false. I've had no problems whatsoever reading the dial in all sorts of different lighting conditions. 

The other problem I've read about from other reviewers concerned the band, namely the difficulty of adjusting the band and that the band comes undone easily. While it's not the easiest thing to do, I didn't find it to be overly difficult to adjust the band. Within five minutes and a quick look at the Skagen website, where directions are readily available, I had the band at just the right length. I also haven't had any problems with the band coming undone and it feels very secure.

I love these watches and am on my second! I also loved the blue face on this watch. My previous Skagen watch was the traditional white faced. What I do find is quite intriguing is that I received more compliments with the white faced watch than the blue: Go figure. Do you wear a watch for your own pleasure or the pleasure of others? Maybe both. I do like the black faced watch but heard that the black wears off the watch band. I could see me buying both a white and black faced Skagen to go along with this watch. As you can easily see, I am a fan of these watches

From first glance, I knew this would be a good buy.  Some people may frown on the steel look, but the way this bracelet was put together is nothing short of excellent.  Doesn't bind, bend or twist in odd directions.  Firm and solid.  Fits exactly as they say it does.  A must buy from Sabrina Silve

Great for a surprise gift.  Hopefully, they'll hold up over time

I saw these listed in a friday sale and couldn't pass them up. They are about the size of a thumb-tack (the flat, smaller side) and are brilliant blue in color. They are really light, delicate (yet solidly built) and are a great deal. The only possible issue I have is that the setting is higher than I expected and the base of the post is small in diamater (bigger bases sit better on your earlobe). But if that doesn't bother you, these earrings are a fine addition to any collection. Two thumbs up, I'm very happy with my purchase.

  I feel that this watch, and its rectangular brother the EFA120D1AV, are attractive, well-built, feature-filled watches, that sell for a reasonable price. I've seen several posts in which people complain about the darkness of the LCD. However, the use of a black inverse LCD is common among many manufacturers. This use of such a subtle LCD in an analog/digital watch makes the watch look much more elegant than analog/digital watches that use a bright/contrasty LCD in the background. The result is that the analog hands stand-out quite clearly from the LCD in the background, yet the information on the LCD can still be read when desired. This watch manages to present an elegant sophisticated, yet sporty look, while providing a lot of information and functionality. I'm quite pleased with my purchase and only wish it had been easier to choose between this watch and the similar EFA120D1AV

I bought this watch for my husband for Christmas and was so impressed with all of the functions that I ended up giving it to him early and buying him something else for Christmas. We had to get it sized, so if you have small wrists, plan on that. But for the price, this watch absolutely rules. It has so many functions that it is hard to learn at first, but it comes with a little booklet that explains everything

I DID NOT EXPECT THAT CASIO PRODUCES SUCH GOOD QUALITY WATCHES. THIS WATCH IS ACTUALLY BETTER THAN IT SEEMS IN THE PHOTO. IT IS SHINNY AND VERY HEAVY. THATS A VERY GOOD MANUFATURING PRODUCT. BEAUTIFUL AS IT COMBINES ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL READINGS. AND I AM SURE THAT THIS WATCH WILL LAST FOR A LIFE AS ALL MY OTHER CASIO WATCHES WHICH I BOUGHT WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND STILL ARE WORKING. NOT TO MENTION THE PRICE FOR SUCH A FANTASTIC WATCH. JUST 50 DOLLARS? IN GREECE WE SAY "DON'T EVEN SAY IT TO THE PRIEST

I've always wanted to have this item but wasn't sure if i should purchase one through the internet but still i decided i should give it a shot since amazon is known for great shipping and handling . . . I was very pleased upon receiving the product not just it was on time but it was exactly how they described it on the description of the item.  Will definitely purchase again here in amazon and will look forward for my next shopping experience

I love my Bulova watch.  I was looking for a women's watch that would stand out a little more than the average watch and this one does it for sure!  It looks great and has just enough sparkle without being too much.  It is a larger watch than many women's but the detail and the design make it look very feminine.  I have small wrist, so I had to remove four links from it, but it looks great and is not overpowering.  I don't think I have taken it off since it arrived!

On the price - I had been looking at this watch for 3 months.  Amazon was hundreds cheaper than everyone else.  Many places are selling if for $369 to $499.

My Husband actually purchased this for me for Christmas.  My previous watch was a Bulova.  It was 12 years old, with two clasps and only 3 battery replacements!  This new one had a lot to live up to.  It certainly exceeded my expectations.  I love this new design, and the size is perfect.  It is a little larger without being too bulky.  The diamonds around the face are just enough bling without looking tacky.  I get a lot of compliments on my new watch.  Bulova is certainly my first choice

When I first saw this necklace, I considered it one of the best amazon had to offer, as usual I assumed it would not be as great as the image made it out to be and I was right. First of all, it was smaller then it looks on the picture here, but more importantly, on my copy, one of the indentations that line the inside of the dragons was missing. But don't get me wrong, it's just a small imperfection, I still think it's a great desig

Quite the conversational piece. A good buy for dragon lovers or Celtic "fiends". A small historical reference to "second sight" makes the silver piece more appealing at least to me.........

The pendant was much bigger than I was expecting. It's very difficult to find an outfit that this necklace will go with because of the oversized pendent, I haven't been able to wear it much. The quality of the beads is good, the pendant is sort of plastic feeling but you have to touch it to notice. The cord everything is strung on is very cheap.

Nice peice if you really want to make a statement and no one's going to look too close

I LOVE THIS WATCH.  I WAITED UNTIL I OWNED IT FOR SEVEN MONTHS BEFORE WRITING THIS RERVIEW. IT KEEPS GREAT TIME AND BY LEAVING IT NEAR A WINDOW AT NIGHT, IT CALABRATES WITH FT. COLLINS. UNLIKE THE AUTOMATIC WATCH I PREVIOUSLY OWNED, IT DOESN'T STOP.  THE EARLY MORNING SUNLIGHT IT RECEIVES NEAR THE WINDOW IS SUFFICENT TO KEEP IT WORKING WELL. I WOULD HAVE RATED IT FIVE STARS EXCEPT FOR ONE FACTOR. THE SMALL WINDOW NEEDED TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS IS DIFFICULT TO SEE. I LOST THE MANUAL AND DON'T KNOW HOW TO ADJUST TIME CHANGES ( THE WATCH DOES THIS AUTOMATICALLY BUT ONLY ON THE DAY AFTER YOU GO FROM DAYLIGHT TO STANDARD TIME)AND TIME ZONE CHANGES.  I ASSUME THAT I WILL BE ABLE TO GET THE INFO FROM CASIO.  UNFORTUNATELY, THE MANUAL IS NOT IN AMAZON'S DIGITAL LIBRARY. I PAID $80 FOR IT ON AMAZON AND IT IS A STEAL AT THE CURRENT PRICE.  IF IT WAS EASIER TO READ THE INFO IN THE WINDOW, THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN RATED A 5 EVEN AT THE HIGHER PRICE THAT I PAID

I bought my first Wave Ceptor several years ago.  I got a good deal on it but the plastic band broke about a year ago and it is designed so it could not be replaced unless you sent it back to Casio.  I learned from that one.  These watches keep perfect time and this band is REPLACABLE.  The looks of this watch are terrific with the gold ring around the blue field.  Yes, it only has the day displayed, but if you become familiar with the buttons, you can find all of the other information.  Besides, if you don't know the month and the year, you need more help then this watch can give you.  This is a great deal on this watch. Almost half price.  I am happy.

I bought three of these for my teenage daughter and her two best friends to put best friend charms on. I was very pleased with the quality of the chain, I would surely buy these again. The girls love them! The purchase was very easy, seller was great! Thank you for the nice quality.

I actually received one of these as a gift 11 years ago.  It was monogramed, and it has held up fine to daily use.  It would make a nice gift to anyone who may have bought a new car recently

Perfect watch for a teenager!  It is easy to see the time and set the time.  I like the alarm feature on it which we can set for him to wake up to each morning.  If by chance he loses it I'm not worried since it was pretty inexpensive

Originally written for the Orange Monster, this review holds equally true for the black version.

From the moment you first hold this watch in your hand, you realize it is a quality timepiece. The first thing that strikes you is its large size and heavy feel, yet despite that, it feels comfortable on the wrist due to its fine balance.

BRACELET:
The bracelet end links (those that attach to the watch case) are solid rather than formed sheet metal like you will find on most other watches in this price range. The pins holding the bracelet to the watch are the sturdiest I have ever seen. Each of the bracelet's subsequent links is also made from a solid piece of steel, not folded sheet, each component being feather-edged to prevent it digging into the wrist. Its removable link pins are of an unusual machined pin and collar design which, though fiddly to remove and replace, nevertheless ensure that the pins remain under-flush and secure when correctly installed. The bracelet is perfectly flush on the side that contacts your wrist making it feel very smooth during wear.
The clasp is very high quality, having both a fold over security buckle, which deploys with a satisfying click, and an Omega style double button catch. The security buckle closes onto a spring pin whose ends are spherical thus ensuring a tight fastening which should not wear with use. All in all these features add up to a watch that is very quiet on the wrist, the only faint sound coming from its automatic winding mechanism.
Finally the bracelet incorporates a clever hidden diver's extension (to allow the watch to be worn over a wet suit).

CASE:
The watch case, back and bezel are made from stainless steel. The case has an attractive mix of polished, brushed and machined finishes which all add to the feel of quality and function. The overall impression is that this is a precision instrument rather than a fashion piece; that's not to say though that it would look out of place with a dinner jacket any more than a wet suit.
The unidirectional bezel is of a heavily scalloped design, protected by bezel-guards which extend upwards from each of the lug pairs. The lower guard also functions as a crown guard and, all in all, the impression is of a case machined from a solid billet of steel. The bezel sits slightly higher than the domed crystal, thus providing protection from scratching and the crystal itself is of a proprietary Seiko material "hardlex" which, as I understand it, is better at resisting scratches than mineral glass but less susceptible to shattering than sapphire.
The luminosity of this watch is astounding due partly to the use of Seiko's proprietary "lumibrite" paint but also to the large coated areas on the hour markers and hands.
The bezel only turns one way, as a safety feature for timing dives, and feels silky smooth, the best I've experienced on any Seiko or Invicta diver. It has 120 clicks per revolution and is nicely aligned with the face.

MOVEMENT:
The watch uses the 21 jewel Seiko 7S26 movement running at 21,600 bph (5 ticks per second). It is non-hacking which means that the second hand does not stop when the crown is pulled out. Although this makes it difficult to synchronize, if a slight backward pressure is applied to the fully extended crown, it is possible to stop the second hand. The watch can not be hand wound but the self winding mechanism is very efficient and I have found that it has a power reserve of at least 24 hours. The 7S26 has been around for many years and has a reputation for ruggedness and reliability.

ACCURACY:
There are several reviews where people complain of poor accuracy. Typically, when new, automatic movements will be set to run fast at the factory because they tend to slow down after a few weeks of use. I own three watches with the 7S26 movement and after their breaking in period all are now keeping time to within 10 seconds per day.
I have a few thoughts on accuracy. You have to ask yourself how accurate does your watch need to be? If it is running 10 or 20 seconds fast per day then set it one minute slow and you will only need to re-set it once every week or two when it has advanced to one minute fast. If you need more accuracy then, unless you are willing to pay at least five times as much for a swiss watch, then buy a quartz.

Finally, if you do a search on the Seiko Monster you'll quickly come to realize that in its various colours, these watches are firm favourites amongst those who are members of internet watch forums. I would highly recommend that you purchase one and see for yourself

Let me start by stating that Amazon prices are the best for this product. I also kept the free shipping (3 - 5 days), and received the monster in three days from the purchase date.

This time piece is awesome. I'm a avid watch collector and have had my eye on the one for a few months. A friend of mine purchased the Orange Monster and I had to have one too. I opted for the Black Monster with the rubber dive band; more my style. I can say without a doubt that I am very impressed. There are a lot of compliments to go around too. Everyone who sees it wants to check it out closer, try it on and/or ask where I bought it. Nice balance, accurate, attractive, and very, very large.

I received the Seiko "Black Monster" and basically the photos don't do it justice.This is a very big and bold watch and it seems that all the reviews I've read are positive.The price is such a steal on this watch,and it's very competitive with other diver's watches costing 2 or 3 times the price tag.I picked up the one with the stainless steel bracelet (which is a work of art itself).The only complaint I have is with the time frame  for the delivery...I selected the 1 day shipping feature for an additional $14.98 but it took almost 3 days to get here.It was no big deal... but it should have been more clear when I was ordering.  There was a little note that stated "If ordered within the next 2 hours you  get 1 day shipping"

There is far too much metal for the stone thats there.  Although this shouldn't pose a problem for those seeking some serious accessories, I was disappointed as the pictures gave me the impression that it was far more stone than metal.

This pendant is very pretty, but it's not quite what I expected.  The dimensions are given as 3/4 inch high and wide, but I was picturing it a bit larger.  I also thought the chain would be more robust, but it is very fine.  It is packaged in a cheap felt bag inside a cardboard box.  These are not bad things, and I do like the necklace, but I thought I'd put down my misconceptions to help others make a decision.  Overall the product seems to be of very good quality

This is a great watch made by Seiko for the lowest possible price for a fashion watch.  It is pink and silver with a clever band.  I love the rhinestones.  I bought this watch with another one just as nice for $11!!
You can hunt all over the internet and not find a bargain like this!  The band was a little tight so I used a removeable link from another watch I had.  Presto!  Two great, fun to wear watches
