# Weather Data Analysis and Forecasting

## Overview
This project explores weather data to uncover trends, perform forecasts, and generate actionable insights using advanced data analysis techniques.

---

## Project Structure
- **`WeatherTrendForecasting.ipynb`:** Main Jupyter Notebook containing the entire analysis, model building, and visualizations.
- **`data/`:** Directory with raw and cleaned datasets.
- **`visualizations/`:** Folder containing all generated plots and charts.
- **`README.md`:** Project documentation.

---

## Steps and Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handled missing values and inconsistencies.
   - Converted time-related features to datetime format for time-series analysis.
   - Scaled numerical features for uniformity.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Scatter plots, heatmaps, and violin plots revealed trends and correlations.
   - Seasonal patterns in temperature and precipitation were identified.

3. **Forecasting Models:**
   - Implemented ARIMA for univariate forecasting using the `last_updated` feature.
   - Evaluated performance using metrics such as RMSE and MAE.

4. **Advanced Analyses:**
   - Seasonal decomposition to extract trends and anomalies.
   - Outlier detection for key weather metrics.
   - Decision-tree-based predictions for high-precipitation events.

## Results and Insights
- **Temperature Trends:**
  - Notable warming during mid-year months.
  - High correlation between temperature and humidity.
- **Precipitation:**
  - Seasonal spikes consistent with expected weather cycles.
  - Identified anomalies indicative of unusual weather events.

### Forecasting Accuracy:
- **RMSE:** 3.2
- **MAE:** 2.8
